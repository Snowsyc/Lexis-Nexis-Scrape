<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought review of a Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's uninsured motorist claim under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(1). Plaintiff's insurer was a foreign insurer not authorized to transact rate-regulated business in the state; plaintiff's policy was procured through a surplus-line broker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant, his automobile liability insurer, to recover damages caused through the negligence of an uninsured motorist. The lower court granted judgment to defendant, holding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(1), which required policies issued for delivery in Louisiana to contain uninsured motorist coverage unless expressly waived, did not apply to unauthorized insurers like defendant, who in accordance with the law issued policies through surplus line brokers. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The broad and unambiguous language of the statute expressly provided that all policies issued for delivery in Louisiana must afford uninsured motorist coverage. The court found no intent to exempt from this requirement policies issued through Louisiana licensed brokers for coverage of Louisiana based automobiles and Louisiana policyholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was reversed and remanded because surplus line insurers were subject to same requirement to provide uninsured motorist coverage as authorized insurers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a father and a son, sued defendants, Louisiana High School Athletic Association (LHSAA) and a Catholic high school, to enjoin defendants from declaring the son had forfeited one year's athletic eligibility pursuant to the LHSAA's transfer rule. The Court of Appeal, First Circuit, Parish of Terrebonne, Louisiana reversed the judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sought a writ of certiorari on their claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son attempted to participate in the Catholic high school's interscholastic athletic program as a member of the football team. The high school ruled the son ineligible for his first year, because of the transfer rule of the LHSAA of which the high school was a member. The trial court issued an injunction against the high school and LHSAA prohibiting the enforcement of the transfer rule against the son and others similarly situated. The court of appeals reversed because it found no abridgement of the son's religious freedom nor any deprivation of equal protection and the transfer rule had a rational basis. The supreme court found that the LHSAA's activities were subject to court scrutiny because the son contended that he was denied equal protection or religious liberty by the enforcement of LHSAA rules. The transfer rule was uniformly applied and not arbitrary, and related rationally to a legitimate governmental interest, which was to discourage unethical recruiting practices, therefore, the rule did not violate the guarantee of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certiorari was granted to the First Judicial District Court of Caddo Parish, Louisiana, to review an order denying a motion to stay prosecution and revoke defense counsels' appointments, or to order reasonable compensation. The lawyers argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:141 violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and defendants were deprived of effective assistance of counsel under La. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 13, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no showing that the defendants would not be effectively represented by skilled counsel. The trial court had the inherent power to appoint lawyers not on the volunteer panel under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:14. Section 15:141 did not limit payment to lawyers on the panel. If the district court denied compensation because the lawyers were not on the panel, an application for relief could be had. The motion was premature since no services had yet been rendered. In the absence of any legislation, and regardless of any provisions of the Louisiana Constitution, the United States Constitution and decisions of the United States Supreme Court would require the appointment of counsel for indigents accused of crime. The request to stay prosecution until further legislative action was taken was not taken seriously. The court could not say, even in the absence of the Louisiana Convention debates, that &sect; 15:141 so lacked uniformity that it violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Nor was the lack of uniformity so clear to the legislature that it capriciously abdicated its responsibility under art. I, &sect; 13. There were no exigent emergent conditions requiring extraordinary measures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator former officer challenged his dismissal from respondent police department, and asserted that the Civil Service Commission improperly ruled that the officer was required to pay for the hearing transcript in order to appeal the decision upholding his dismissal. Upon the grant of a writ of review, the officer appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which affirmed the Commission's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer contended that, since a hearing officer was appointed to hear the officer's appeal, La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15(O)(6), (8), required the Commission to provide for a hearing transcript for Commission review, and provided authority for the Commission to assess transcript costs only against the police department for subsequent judicial review. The officer also maintained that requiring the officer to pay the transcript costs violated La. Unif. R. Ct. App. 1-10, since payment of such costs was not required by the rule. The Supreme Court of Louisiana first held that, even though La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15(O)(6), required the Commission to provide a transcript of the hearing which was not held before the Commission, La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15(O)(8), merely permitted the Commission to assess the transcript costs to the department and did not preclude assessment of the costs to the officer. Further, while La. Unif. R. Ct. App. 1-10 governed the costs of preparing and transporting the record on appeal, the Commission had the sole authority to assess the costs of recording and transcribing testimony with regard to Commission hearings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed alleging that the trial judge imposed his sentence of imprisonment with the proviso that it be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, an unauthorized sentence under the penalty clause of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:25. He also argued that the five-year sentence was &quot;grossly disproportionate&quot; in view of the nature of the offense and defendant's prior record. The court affirmed. The court found that the trial judge had merely recommended to the parole and correctional authorities, that defendant not be given the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension, of the sentence. Defendant cited no authority, nor was the court aware of any, which prohibited a trial judge from making such a recommendation.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court held that officer testimony about beer cans found in defendant's vehicle when he was arrested was not reversible error. The court noted the officers could search, incident to a lawful arrest, defendant and the area within his immediate control, for weapons or contraband. Defendant had been standing next to the vehicle searched when he was arrested, and officers had observed a loaded pistol in plain view on the seat. The court held that the beer cans were relevant, though not contraband, because they were near defendant's cooking paraphernalia and in the vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Mary (Louisiana), which convicted him of armed robbery, a violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, armed with a pistol, robbed a store clerk. He was arrested under a nearby house, where the victim and witnesses had seen him go into hiding. The defense pleaded insanity and an insanity hearing was held three days before trial. A defense motion for continuance, orally argued on the day of trial, asserting inadequate time to develop the insanity defense and prepare for trial, was denied, as was a motion during trial for a recess for the non-appearance of a witness subpoenaed that morning. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the pretrial continuance motion did not comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 707 absent verified signatures on the supporting affidavit, and absent compelling reasons for either continuance or recess, denial was not an abuse of discretion. The court ruled that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 652, requiring defendant to overcome a presumption of sanity, was constitutional, and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64, withholding parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, was not cruel and unusual punishment or a violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants attacked the validity of the search, as illegally based on false information misrepresented by the affiant who secured the warrant. The court found that defendants' convictions must be set aside and a new trial be granted because the trial court, under the circumstances shown, incorrectly prevented her from attacking the credibility of the affiant. Misrepresentation by an affiant could not justify the invasion of an individual's home or his privacy when there was in fact no true probable cause for the invasion, as required by the state and federal constitutions. Her contention that her home was invaded on the basis only of suspicion, in violation of the state and federal constitutions, was shown to have at least prima facie validity. Also, the prosecution did not cite any authority by which the officers had a right to arrest defendant, without a warrant, simply because he was parked in his own automobile outside his girlfriend's house. Although the search warrant gave them a right to search the girl's apartment, it did not justify a search of the van parked outside.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal reversed the trial court's decision and held that the consent of the wife's father was not necessary to uphold the validity of a prenuptial contract entered into by the wife and plaintiff husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and the wife executed a prenuptial contract and stipulated that there would not be a community of acquets and gains. When the husband filed an action for divorce, the wife filed a reconventional demand, alleged the existence of a community, and requested a partition. The trial court held that the prenuptial contract was null because the wife, a minor at the time it was executed, did not have her father's consent. The court of appeal reversed. The court reversed the court of appeal's judgment. Under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2330, a minor had to be assisted in an agreement by those persons whose consent was necessary to the marriage. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 112, however, prevented nonconsenting parents from annulling a marriage on the grounds of lack of consent. The two statutes could both be given effect by recognizing that each reflected two different, yet equally important, public policies. A marriage contract entered into by a minor with the assistance of his parents was valid; however, if entered into without the assistance of both parents, it was null. Thus, a marriage contract entered into by an unemancipated minor without the assistance of her father was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one argued that the validity of the search of her apartment was illegally based. The court rejected defendant one's attack on the facial insufficiency of the affidavit of probable cause upon which the search warrant was based. The court, setting aside defendant one's conviction, remanded for a new trial because she was incorrectly prevented from attacking the credibility of the officer. The court stated that the trial court had improperly held that defendant one made an insufficient showing that there was a genuine issue that the officer had sworn untruthfully that he had been furnished the information from a confidential informer. The court stated that defendant one's contention that her home was invaded on the basis of suspicion only, in violation of the state and federal constitutions, was shown to have prima facie validity and that she should not have been barred from development of the facts. Defendant two argued that marijuana was seized from his motor vehicle without a warrant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an out-of-state tobacco dealer, sued the state revenue collector, challenging the state's application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:842(5) or the &quot;grandfather clause,&quot; as a denial of Equal Protection under the XIV Amendment and an undue burden on interstate commerce, seeking equitable relief. The trial court, on rehearing, found the grandfather clause violated equal protection and granted relief, severing the clause. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contends the discrimination between the retailer and those dealers who were affixing tobacco stamps did not infringe equal protection guarantees since it is rationally aligned with the state's desire to protect and preserve the integrity and efficiency of its revenue system. The issue was whether the date and place of affixing stamps was essential to a determination of which Louisiana &quot;wholesale dealers&quot; were qualified under the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; i.e., would the process achieve the state's proclaimed objective of preserving revenue system integrity and efficiency, and was it so rationally aligned with the state's desire to keep &quot;wholesale dealers&quot; within tight control that it met the Equal Protection test. Affixing stamps on a given date in state by its wholesale dealer was not essential to the achieving the state's objectives. Thus those requirements in the definition for determining which of the in-state &quot;wholesale dealers&quot; would be automatically qualified under the clause was arbitrary and capricious. The dealer cooperated with the state, handling and affixing the stamps in its state expeditiously and efficiently; its records and returns were always accurate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether an order of seizure and sale signed by the parish clerk of court, rather than by a judge, was sufficient compliance with the federal due process requirement of judicial control of ex parte seizures. The court found no constitutional infirmity in executory proceedings based upon an order of seizure and sale signed by a clerk instead of by a judge. The appellate court denied the deficiency judgment because it held the initial seizure offended federal due process. The safeguards to the debtor were far greater than in the pre-judgment seizures. Louisiana executory process was issued not upon conclusory allegations by the creditor but instead upon narrowly circumscribed proof, such as authentic evidence and a confession of judgment. The Louisiana executory process provided for an early opportunity for the debtor to contest and set aside a seizure as unjustified in law or in fact.</SPAN></P>

The court was satisfied that nothing in the record demonstrated enmity of the prospective jurors against defendant. The sole question, therefore, was whether their negative attitude toward racial intermarriage was cause to brand them as partial to such an extent that they were unable to &quot;render an impartial verdict according to the law and the evidence.&quot; The jurors responded that the fact that the accused was black would have no effect on their judgment. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in allowing the admission of the fruits of a search executed on defendant's apartment without a warrant, following his signing of a search waiver, when the waiver was signed involuntarily. The burden of proving that the consent was invalid on a motion to suppress was upon defendant. It did not appear that defendant had discharged his burden.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being sentenced to 18 years at hard labor for being a third felony offender, defendant appealed, claiming that the habitual offender law, La.

The court held that the habitual offender law was constitutional. The law did not make it a crime to be a multiple offender; it merely prescribed an enhanced penalty for multiple offenders. Therefore, the statute did not punish a status, nor did it impose cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that although defendant failed to preserve the issue for review, the constitutionality of the statute was discoverable by mere inspection of the pleadings and proceedings pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 920 (amended 1974). Defendant also claimed that the sentence inflicted cruel and unusual punishment because the severity of his sentence was disproportionate to his crime. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 920 (amended 1974), the court could not review that claim because defendant failed to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 99 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, commutation, or diminution of sentence. He appealed and argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence found in his car without a search warrant. The court stated that the officers thought of defendant when a description of the suspect came over their radio and turned towards his home to question him. Before they got there, they observed defendant driving away from the area of the robbery. The officers stopped defendant. They observed that the clothing he wore and the clothing in the car matched the description of the suspect; they also saw a gun in the car. Defendant argued that at the time he was stopped he was not acting suspiciously or violating any law. The court held that the officers had reasonable cause to stop and investigate defendant. The court noted that defendant's sentence was contrary to law. The court stated that deprivation of commutation of sentence was not an authorized penalty for armed robbery and infringed on the prerogative of the governor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles (Louisiana), which convicted him of the first-degree murder of a deputy sheriff, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30, and imposed the mandatory death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy sheriff answered a disturbance call and the crowd became unruly. Defendant took the sheriff's revolver and shot him in the back, killing him. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court followed case law and ruled that capital punishment as a sentence when defendant had been convicted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 was not per se constitutionally proscribed and the district court did not ere in denying defendant's motion to quash the indictment. The court found that prospective jurors were properly excused for cause as they were questioned at length by the State and in most cases by the district court, and because a juror was only excused for cause when the testimony made clear that under no circumstances could he return a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder or that his fixed opinions prevented an impartial determination of guilty based upon the evidence. Finally, the court found that defendant's low intelligence and inadequate education did not preclude the knowing waiver of his rights; therefore, his subsequent confession, given after proper Miranda warnings, was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

The court held further that the mayor's court had authority to punish the criminal conduct in question, and that the municipality had the right to enact police regulations necessary for the preservation of order and peace of the municipality and to provide penalties. Because the municipal code was not inconsistent with state statutes, it was immaterial that the same conduct was punished by both the state and the municipality in the concurrent exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Parish of Grant (Louisiana) that granted motions of defendant hunters to quash the charges of hunting on a public road in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by separate bills of information with hunting on a public road in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:292. They filed motions to quash the charges on the ground that the statute forming the basis of the prosecution was vague and indefinite, in that it did not give defendants reasonable notice or knowledge as to what acts constitute hunting on a public road. After a hearing on the matter, the trial judge granted the motions to quash. The court reversed and held that &sect; 32:292 was constitutional under the state and federal constitutions. The court held that the word &quot;hunting&quot; in &sect; 32:292 had a clearly defined meaning and, absent express qualification, it was assumed that the legislature employed the word according to its accepted meaning. As used in &sect; 32:292, the term &quot;hunting&quot; both informed defendants of the nature and cause of the accusation against them and afforded them fair notice of the conduct proscribed by the statute. As such, the court concluded that the trial court erred in finding the statute unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the judgment of the Tenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Red River (Louisiana), which dismissed the indictments against defendants for bribery of voters on the ground that La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 14:119 prohibited, among other things, the indirect offering to give anything of apparent or prospective value to any voter with the intent to influence that voter in casting his ballot. This language was not vague; it was clear and unambiguous. But it was overbroad. The statute on its face made it a crime for political candidates and their spokesmen to do such things as promise voters better government in return for their votes; give voters handbills or dinners to influence them to vote for their candidate; promise to lower taxes or implement welfare reform after election. The court stated the overbroad statute stifled conduct which was otherwise protected under the First Amendment along with activities that could be constitutionally proscribed. While generally a litigant was not permitted to challenge the overbreadth of a statute as it pertained to activities they were not engaged in, the court noted that when the statute prohibited free expression protected by the First Amendment, defendants could attack the statute even though their particular conduct could constitutionally be made criminal by the statute. The court refused to rewrite the overbroad statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court that the statute was constitutionally infirm, and its action in quashing the indictments was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a gas station attendant while committing a robbery and was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. He appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the district court did not err when it denied defendant's motion for a new trial based on the allegation that the State had failed to prove as an element that none of the items taken from the gas station had value, because there was no question that the items taken would have constituted &quot;something of value,&quot; when that phrase was given the broadest construction. Independent proof of the value was not required as it was conclusively shown that gas was taken. The district court properly overruled defendant's motion for a continuance after it amended the indictment because defendant did not show that he was prejudiced on the merits by the change, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 489. The court found that the death penalty mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 after conviction under subsection (1) was not unconstitutional per se, because under La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed his conviction but reversed his death sentence. The trial court properly allowed the evidence clerk to remove the contents of a box containing evidence taken at the crime scene and read the list of items because the chain of custody was a matter for the jury to decide. The lack of identification by one witness of the live cartridge and two spent casings went to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility. The court found it more probable than not that the objects were the ones taken from the crime scene. The court found that the witness's in-court identification of defendant had a source independent of any out-of-court identification. The fact that she was unable to identify defendant at a prior lineup was explained by the fact that defendant's hair was shorter and he lacked the moustache, goatee, and sideburns that he had when the witness first met him. The court reversed defendant's death sentence, however, because the Louisiana death penalty statute was similar to the Georgia statute, which the U.S. Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over rights to property lying beneath navigable waters, the private entities claimed that they purchased the property from an individual who held a patent to the property from the state and that the state was barred under a statute of limitations from nullifying the transfer. However, the court overruled prior case law supporting the private entities' claim and held that the state law limiting the time to bring actions to nullify the transfer of state property did not implicitly give the state the authority to transfer public property submerged beneath navigable water. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the state lacked the authority to transfer such submerged property because such property belonged to the public at large and was inalienable. The court also reasoned that canons of statutory interpretation did not support a reading of the state law that would imply the authority to transfer such property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction of distribution of heroin and sentence of live imprisonment imposed by the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) on the reasoning that he was denied due process of law when he was not arrested until seven months after the alleged sale and the sentence imposed constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the seven month delay between the time of the alleged sale and the arrest was unusual and unnecessary and hindered him in the preparation and assertion of his defense. Defendant did not testify at trial and argued that no one was called to testify at trial for him because no one could accurately testify to his whereabouts seven months before his arrest. The court noted the punishment in the case was imprisonment at hard labor and under the authority of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 572 the state merely had to institute the prosecution within six years of the offense. The court held the seven-month interval, without showing more, was not sufficient to hold that defendant had been denied the due process of a fair trial guarantees of the law. Defendant argued La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966 (B), which imposed a mandatory life imprisonment for the violation of the statute, was unconstitutional because it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed and stated it was not so severe to be degrading, was not arbitrarily inflicted, and it was not disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of distribution of heroin and sentence of life imprisonment were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Defendant's constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection were not violated because of the exemption of women from jury service, which was held to be unconstitutional by a decision that was not retroactively applied. Defendant's statements relating to the location of the gun were properly admitted because he was given Miranda warnings and advised three times of his constitutional rights before signing a waiver of rights form and making a video-recorded statement. The court found that prior to arraignment, defendant voluntarily and intelligently waived counsel after being advised of his rights, and that he was represented by counsel at the arraignment. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's requested special charge that if he had not intent to commit a theft, he could not be found guilty of second degree murder because it was included in the general and special charges to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, the defense sought to compel the state to furnish the entire evidence upon which the state relied for conviction.The court held that discovery from the state could not be compelled in criminal cases except for limited subjects, and insofar as the request for the names of the state's witnesses was concerned, the state had furnished the names to the entire world in the public case file. Defendant's written confession was freely and voluntarily given where defendant never invoked the right to remain silent. The fact that defendant refused to sign a waiver of rights form after having been fully informed of his rights did not render him incapable of making voluntary verbal inculpatory statements or confessions thereafter. A police officer's reference to &quot;some other things he had done&quot; did not entitle defendant to a mistrial. Defendant's motion to remand because women were excluded from the jury was denied because the decision declaring the Louisiana authority for excluding women from jury service unconstitutional, as well as La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment from the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides, State of Louisiana, which declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:74(1) (1950) to be unconstitutional and quashed a bill of information that had been filed against defendant charging him with the criminal neglect of his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with the criminal neglect of his wife in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:74(1). Defendant filed a motion to quash the information alleging that the statute violated the guarantees of equal protection under the Louisiana and United States Constitutions. The trial judge agreed and granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 14:74, which discriminated against men by proscribing the intentional nonsupport of wives by husbands but not of husbands by wives, was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Despite the increasing activities of women in the marketplace of commerce, the husband was invariably the dominant or only means of support for a couple. In achieving the legitimate state objective of protecting the welfare of citizens by prohibiting the desertion or intentional nonsupport of a wife by a husband, the statute similarly treated the vast majority of all those similarly situated. The statute demonstrated a rational relation between the classification of supporters of spouses as male and the achievement of a legitimate legislative objective. The statute did not violate equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the ruling quashing the bill of information filed against defendant. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with La. Const. of 1921, art. VII, &sect; 41 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 402, women were not included in the jury venire unless they had previously filed an application for jury duty. Although the United States Supreme Court found that the exemption from jury service that was granted to women violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court's ruling did not invalidate the jury because the decision did not apply retroactively. Because a racially neutral list of registered voters was used as the source for prospective jurors, the court rejected defendant's contention that members of defendant's race were systematically excluded from the jury venires. The court determined that defendant could not complain that evidence was seized during an unconstitutional search because defendant had neither filed a motion to suppress nor objected to the introduction of the evidence at trial. The court held that a penalty of life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for a period of 20 years did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Parish enacted an ordinance that levied an annual tax against railways that maintained or operated on tracks within the Parish. The railways filed an action against defendants seeking a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the action along with three consolidated companion suits. On appeal, the court reversed and declared the ordinance unconstitutional. The Parish was not authorized to levy the tax. The Louisiana Constitution and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1236(7) (1950) conferred authority upon the Parish to levy taxes only as authorized by the constitution or legislature.The Parish did not have any independent authority to levy a tax in addition to those taxes expressly authorized. If the ordinance was characterized as a property tax or as a license tax, the Parish was not authorized to levy it by provisions of the constitution and statutes in effect at the time the ordinance was enacted. The tax was not a &quot;service charge&quot; that was exempt from the requirement of express authorization, and there was no justification for the imposition of the ordinance in the regulatory exercise of police power under La.

The contractor appealed the trial court's adverse judgment, which was affirmed with the addition of an award of attorney's fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish electors petitioned the parish police jury, which was the parish governing authority, requesting that a local option election be called under the surviving provisions of Act 41, with a view to controlling alcoholic beverages. The police jury scheduled a parish-wide election, at which time the four propositions authorized by Act 41 and contained in La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of manslaughter by a jury in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of West Baton Rouge (Louisiana). He was subsequently sentenced to 6 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the trial judge erred when he denied his motion to quash the bill of information on the ground that the petit jury venire was improperly drawn, selected, or constituted in that it was composed of women who had not previously filed with the clerk of court a written declaration of their desire to be subject to jury service. Prior cases held the practice of granting women an automatic exemption from jury service was unconstitutional, but that the decision would not be applied retroactively. Therefore, the appellate court found no merit in his argument. Defendant asserted in his second assignment of error that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant a mistrial after the foreman of the jury announced during deliberations that two jurors were unable to read and write. In view of the fact that the only written exhibits had been fully read aloud to the jurors during the trial and none were taken with them during their deliberations, the appellate court found that the literacy or the lack of it was not of such significance as to warrant the drastic remedy of a mistrial. The appellate court held that the trial judge correctly refused to order a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture, appealed the judgment of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana), that awarded damages to plaintiff farmer in his malicious prosecution claim and declared invalid La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:2223, a Bangs Disease Eradication law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the farmer refused to comply with the requests of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture (the Department) to quarantine his cattle herd under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:2223, the Department unsuccessfully filed several suits seeking compliance. Thereafter, the farmer filed suit alleging malicious prosecution and seeking a determination that the statutes were unconstitutional. Judgment was rendered in the farmer's favor, and the Department appealed. In reversing in part, the court concluded that because the Department's actions were based upon probable cause and there was no showing of malice by the Department in seeking to enforce the statutes, the farmer's claim of malicious prosecution failed. In affirming, however, the court concluded that the statutes permitted the quarantine of the entire herd for an indefinite and prolonged period of time without giving the affected party an opportunity for a hearing or to stay the effect of the quarantine pending an appeal. The statutes were patently offensive and incompatible with due process because they permitted irreparable injury. Because the statutes failed to impose guidelines, they were unconstitutionally broad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment awarding damages to the farmer on his malicious prosecution claim was reversed, but the judgment declaring La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;3:2223 to be unconstitutional was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school board sued defendant, its former employee, to recover an overpayment from the employee's overstating the number of hours he and the members of his cleaning crew worked. The employee filed a reconventional demand based on their agreement. The trial court held that the school board was immune from suit and liability and dismissed the reconventional demand. The Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed. The school board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the school board submitted the issues of its relations with the employee to the courts for adjudication when it instituted suit against him. By invoking the power and authority of the judicial system to adjust its relations with the employee vis a vis the employment agreement that allegedly led to the overpayment of wages, the supreme court held that the school board concomitantly waived any immunity from suit it may have possessed. Thus, the supreme court held that the appellate court was correct in refusing to affirm the trial court's action in maintaining the school board's exception to the employee's reconventional demand. As the supreme court's decision that the school board had not successfully interposed a plea of immunity to defeat the employee's reconventional demand was based on its determination that the school board waived any immunity it might have had by filing the main demand, it pretermitted a determination of the constitutionality of Act 67 of 1962, the basis upon which the appellate court reversed the trial court's actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate court was set aside. The trial court's judgment sustaining the school board's exception was set aside, and the exception overruled. The employee's reconventional demand was reinstated. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Second Judicial District Court, Parish of Jackson (Louisiana) issued a permanent injunction against the State, prohibiting the enforcement of Act 325 of the 1974 Legislative Session, and declaring it to be unconstitutional and therefore void and of no effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 325 of the 1974 Louisiana Legislative Session was unconstitutional.

The ordinances had to be completely reenacted under the procedure provided for local option elections and ordinances.

The appellate court found that it was apparent form the letters that the police jury intended for the Red River Parish Police Jury, La., Ordinance 55 to result in the cessation of liquor sales in the parish. However, the only result the ordinance could have was to withdraw from the parish the functions of collecting licensing fees and monitoring the licenses for retail of alcoholic beverages and liquor in the parish.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1974 relator six state police officers filed a mandamus action against defendant Director of the Department of Public Safety, Division of State Police, to compel the payment of overtime wages due to relators for 1966, 1967, and 1968. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), granted the writ of mandamus holding that 1969 La. Acts 34 (amending La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3862) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the Director's assertion that the relators' action had prescribed pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3534. The relators asserted that, as the state legislature had never waived the state's immunity from suit as to their claim, prescription had not begun to run. The court held that, while La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5107 provided that when the legislature authorized suit against the state, a plea of prescription will not bar the action, if suit was filed within one year after the effective date of the act or resolution, that statute had no application to the relators' suit for wages, as no authorizing resolution was needed or enacted. The absence of legislative authorization did not prevent the running of prescription. The court held that the relators' suit for past due wages was barred by the one-year prescription.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought judicial review of his conviction in Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Calcasieu Parish (Louisiana), for murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's complaint of the effective exclusion of women from the jury was rejected. While those provisions of Louisiana law that limited jury service to females who volunteered was held to be unconstitutional after appellant was convicted, the ruling was applicable only to convictions obtained by juries empaneled subsequent to the date of decision. The state supreme court declined to make the ruling retroactive. His contention that his bill of particulars was improper was rejected. Appellant's third assignment of error was also rejected. The State met its burden of showing that his confession was free and voluntary and not the product of coercion, force, inducement, or misrepresentation. Appellant's final assignment of error alleged that his wife should not have been permitted to testify against him. While state law could not compel appellant's wife to testify against him, it did not prohibit her from voluntarily testifying against him as to non-privileged evidence. In its per curiam, the trial court recognized that the sentence was illegal and unconstitutional and should have been corrected on remand.</SPAN></P>

The suspended driver sought to enjoin and prohibit the agency from suspending his driving privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suspended driver's license was suspended for six months after he failed to submit to a chemical test after his arrest for operating a vehicle upon the public streets while under the influence of alcoholic beverages. The driver sued to enjoin the suspension of his license. The trial court enjoined the agency from suspending the license because the test sought to have been administered, a photoelectric intoximeter test, was not a valid test and the suspension was unconstitutional. On appeal, the agency argued that the record was devoid of any evidence whatsoever to show that the test offered was invalid, either legally or scientifically. The appellate court found that although the driver alleged that the test was not valid because it was not approved by the Department of Health pursuant to the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:663, no proof of this fact was offered. In the absence of proof to the contrary, it must be assumed that the test administered by these police officers was provided for in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:663. The record contained no proof that, in order for the test to be in accordance with law, the two phases must have in fact been administered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of heroin, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966. He challenged the overruling of his motion to quash the bill of information by the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana). He alleged that the bill was defective since it did not name the person to whom the heroin was distributed, and that it was unconstitutionally vague. He also challenged the exclusion of testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In charging defendant with distribution of heroin, La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 (1921) did not require that the bill allege the name of the person buying or receiving the drugs. Other information to which defendant was entitled was available to him through a bill of particulars, and the state's answer. Defendant asserted that the word &quot;deliver&quot; in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:961(15) had such a variety of meanings that it made the statute fatally defective. The appellate court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:3 required that the word be taken in its usual sense, in connection with the context. In context, it meant to transfer possession or control. Thus, the statute satisfied the constitutional requirements. Defense counsel cross-examined a state witness concerning his prior investigative work in another parish. The witness denied that he had failed to account for money entrusted to him for the purchase of narcotics in the other parish. Defendant sought to impeach that testimony through testimony from a sheriff. The trial court properly ruled that the sheriff's testimony was inadmissible, since it was clear that the prior investigation was collateral to the charge against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the search and seizure of his vehicle was unconstitutional, that references to another crime committed by him shortly after the present crime were improper, that he was not given Miranda warnings, and that the state failed to disclose its witnesses and evidence. The court initially held that, although the state's proffered justifications for the search and seizure were not applicable, the limited search, the immediacy of it after the arrest, and the inherent probable cause for searching for weapons or evidence a vehicle occupied by those reasonably suspected of recent robbery-murders, supported the constitutionality of the search of defendant's vehicle. The court then held that the incidental and slight reference to defendant's other closely connected crime was not clearly inadmissible. The court further held that defendant was advised of his Miranda rights before he was interrogated, and that the statements given by him were free and voluntary. The court finally held that because the death penalty was held unconstitutional after defendant's sentencing, defendant's sentence was required to be remanded for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the victim was about to get into her car defendant put a knife to her back and told her to get in the car. Defendant got into the car behind her and ordered her to sit very close to him in the front seat. Defendant then drove the victim to a deserted area, forced her into the back seat of the car, and raped her. There was ample opportunity for the victim to observe defendant during the course of the trip. After the rape the victim drove herself to a hospital. The police were called and the victim gave the police a description of the assailant. The victim choose two pictures from a photographic line-up and stated that the assailant either had to be one of the two. Defendant was in one of the two pictures. In a second photographic line up the victim positively identified defendant. The victim also identified defendant at the trial. On a retrial defendant was found guilty of aggravated rape without capital punishment. Defendant's major assertion on appeal was that the motion to suppress the victim's identifications should have been granted. On appeal the court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter. Because he had been convicted by a courts-martial in 1945, he was billed as a second offender and sentenced under the multiple offender law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529 (1958). He appealed the conviction and sentence. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that because except for a 10-month delay occasioned by erroneous rulings of the district court, most of the subsequent delays in bringing defendant to trial resulted from changes of counsel for defendant and defendant's motions in aid of preparation for trial. As defendant was initially tried within nine months of the offense and no actual prejudice was shown by the delays in re-trial, defendant's claim of denial of his right to a speedy trial was without merit. However, the court found that a certified copy of federal prison records and testimony of a police officer identifying fingerprints as defendant's offered by the State as the sole proof of the courts-martial conviction did not meet the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1F to subject defendant to punishment as a multiple offender. As such, defendant's sentence was annulled and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested and indicted for having incited and participated in a riot in which the death of five persons occurred in violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14:329.1-329.8. The court reversed defendant's conviction because the trial court improperly denied defendants' request for a change in venue under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 622. Defendants had the burden of establishing that they could not obtain a fair trial in the parish. Defendants claimed that it would be impossible for them to secure an unbiased jury due to the publicity surrounding their alleged activities. The trial court summoned 300 prospective jurors, empaneled 60 of them, and questioned them concerning the pretrial publicity. The questioning was directed solely at the issue of whether they could serve as impartial jurors. Because nearly two-thirds stated that they could evaluate the evidence according to the law, the trial judge denied defendants' motions. The trial court's ruling was in error, however, because it prevented defendants from being able to present evidence that racial and religious passions in the community would prevent a fair and impartial trial by limiting the questioning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the new zoning classification would still have permitted a bus terminal, it would have imposed front and back yard requirements that would have made such a terminal untenable. Although no property within an 18 square mile area was zoned in such a way, the city attempted to take three lots in the center of the central business area and classify them in this most unreasonable category. The new classification had no relation to the public health, safety, or general welfare. It was not reclassified to promote a solution to the parking problem of the central business area, as argued by the city, but in fact would have been contrary to the over-all parking plans for the area. Only the subject property received special treatment in the zoning regulations. The rezoning of the subject property was contrary to what was purported to be a long-term comprehensive zoning plan. It did not further a plan of revitalization of the riverside area. Rather, if all the property in the riverside area were similarly zoned, the riverside business area would suffer dramatically. The action of the city council in rezoning these lots was therefore arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a conviction and sentence for murder, the court affirmed. The State's theory of the case was that defendant beat the victim and then threw him off a bridge into a bayou, where he drowned. The court held that the function of a bill of particulars was to inform defendant more specifically of the nature and cause of the charge against him under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 484. The bill of particulars was not a device to secure the details of the State's evidence or to burden the State with requests for information unrelated to the nature and cause of the charge. Also, under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 2B and the case law, assuming there was an irregularity in the waiver of extradition, the power of the Louisiana court to try defendant was not impaired. Also, if the State offered evidence that was inadvertently and in good faith omitted from the opening statement, the court could admit the evidence if it found defendant was not prejudiced. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 769 required only that evidence be within the scope of the opening statement. It did not require that all testimony elicited by the State be perfectly consistent with the State's theory of the case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally infirm, on its face, for overbreadth and vagueness because it punished the use of fighting words or language irrespective of whether it was in the immediate presence of another person.

The court stated that the language of Schedule IIIA(2) of &sect; 40:964 was not vague or overly broad.

The court affirmed and held that the statute, while inconsistent with the constitution in some respects, was constitutional. It was not error for the trial court to refuse to grant production of the witness's prior statements when the witness admitted at trial that his in-court statement was different from a prior statement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman worked as a fire equipment operator for the city. During his employment he suffered several job related back injuries, the latest of which, rendered him totally and permanently disabled. He was forced to retire because of his disability at which time he began drawing monthly disability retirement benefits. Subsequently, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the fireman, relative to his job-related accident, for workmen's compensation benefits at a certain rate. Following the date of such judgment, the amount of his disability retirement benefits was reduced by the amount of workmen's compensation benefits which he was then receiving. The fireman contended that the pertinent offset provision of the retirement system was contrary to the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1163, which prohibits an employer's forcing employees to contribute towards any workmen's compensation benefits payable by the employer. The trial court dismissed the action, the appellate court affirmed, and he sought further review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were a utilities company and a car leasing company.

The utilities company had previously received private passenger plates at three dollars per annum for the passenger automobiles it operated. However, the State advised the utilities company that it would be required to surrender its private passenger license plates and obtain commercial plates at an annual cost of $ 10. The taxpayers argued that the taxing authorities relied upon by the State (La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:451(3) and (4); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:475; and La. Const. of 1921, art.

The court found that the automobiles fell within the definition of &quot;commercial use.&quot; The court acknowledged the fact that the automobiles were passenger-carrying automobiles. However, they were not operated &quot;only for private use&quot; as contemplated by the statutes comprising the vehicle registration laws, but were used in the operation of the business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State argued that although the crime of aggravated rape was classified as a capital offense when defendant committed the crime, Louisiana was prohibited from imposing the death penalty by the United States Supreme Court at the time that defendant was tried, therefore there was no patent error in the record because the conviction did not carry the death penalty and was not a &quot;capital&quot; offense mandating sequestration under art. 791. The court rejected the argument and held, as it had in similar cases, that until the legislature amended the statutory classification aggravated rape to make it a non-capital offense, the procedural rules for conducting capital felony trials would continue to be applied. The court reversed the conviction based on patent error in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence from the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier (Louisiana), for the crime of manslaughter. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 41, and procedures for exemption of women from jury service under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 402. He also claimed that the trial court erred in a ruling in favor of the State on its use of grand jury testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant reserved a bill of exception to the denial of his motion to quash the indictment on the ground that women were unconstitutionally excluded from the jury bodies. The trial court followed the procedures set forth in La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 41 (1921) and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 402. On appeal, the court stated that it intended to follow the last authoritative expression of the United States Supreme Court that upheld similar provisions of law from another state. Also, no procedural error was found. The trial judge stated on the record that the juror at issue had requested to be excused, claiming her exemption under &sect; 402. Because no one challenged the accuracy of the trial judge's knowledge of the juror at the time, no voir dire examination or evidence was required. The claim that a unanimous verdict was required lacked merit; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 required only the concurrence of nine jurors. An objection to the State's use of grand jury testimony in its cross-examination of a defense witness was well founded; however, the error was not reversible. The evidence of guilt was overwhelming. It did not appear that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:103A(1), under which they were charged with disturbing the peace by engaging in a fistic encounter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants engaged in a fistfight. They alleged that the phrases &quot;fistic encounter&quot; and &quot;disturb and alarm the public&quot; were vague and overbroad, leaving to the district court unlimited authority to define the offense. The district court held that the phrase &quot;fistic encounter&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and struck down the statute. The court disagreed. The phrase &quot;engaging in a fistic encounter&quot; appeared to the court to be reasonably clear. Taking the words in their usual sense, the phrase meant engaging in a fistfight. The court found in the phrase no unusual distortions to defeat comprehension by a person of ordinary intelligence. Contrary to the defendants' assertion that the sweep of the statute was so broad as to invade the area of protected freedoms, especially the freedom of speech, the court found the statute to have been narrowly drawn. It proscribed only those fistfights that foreseeably would disturb or alarm the public. Defendants questioned whether the statute covered various activities, e.g., a karate chop. The court found no need to classify numerous hypothetical situations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the ruling of the district court, overruled the motion to quash, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to have a certain Act declared valid an enforceable. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the Act was unconstitutional because the Act violated La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 16 (1921). The parish police jury created the drainage district to drain and reclaim land located in the district. The district was authorized to incur debt. Prior to its enactment, the Act was advertised in the parish. Thereafter, the Legislature undertook to amend the statute. One of the main subjects of the Act was to transfer substantial funds from defendant to plaintiffs. The transfer of a portion of the funds was extraordinary subject matter that had to be indicated in the Act's title in such a manner as to apprise the public of the change. The Act's title made no mention of defendant under which the funds were collected or of the transfer of the funds from one political corporation to another. Thus, the court found the title inadequate and misleading.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unless the realty company provided adequate off-street parking, unauthorized parking would have resulted. The city therefore adopted an ordinance rezoning the property and requiring additional parking spaces. The court found that the imposition of reasonable restrictions on the use of the property, which were not applicable at the time the property was acquired, was no cause to invalidate the ordinance. The action taken by the city council was in furtherance of a plan to revitalize the area. It was necessary to avoid further deterioration of acute parking conditions and to further the development concept for the entire river area. In the absence of a showing of substantial expenditures in reliance upon the building permit, there was no vested right to complete the building for which the permit was issued. Because the ordinance was amended two days after the permit was issued, the realty company could only rely on the permit during those two days. Thereafter, faced with the zoning reclassification, the realty company could no longer rely on the permit, for the two were in irreconcilable conflict. Faced with this dilemma, the realty company could not prudently proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offense occurred in jail. The victim was another male prisoner. The bill was reserved when the prosecutor asked a detective to relate what defendant told him about the sexual activity with which he was accused. The defense objected to the introduction of the oral statement citing to the best evidence rule. The record was somewhat confusing about the identification of the specific statement about which the detective testified. Defendant made more than one statement concerning the crime, but only one was introduced. Two witnesses testified about statements by defendant--an attorney for the sheriff's department, and a detective. The attorney recorded a statement taken from defendant and had the statement transcribed. The detective did not preserve the electronic recording, because he had only two tapes for his machine, erasing previous recordings so the tapes could be re-used. The attorney, who recorded the statement, did not testify about its contents. The detective who testified about the statement also testified that it had not been electronically recorded. The court could not, without such a record, determine that the oral statement of defendant was erroneously admitted.</SPAN></P>

Some time later, all of the victims saw the defendant at hearings on pre-trial motions. The identification procedures presented no reversible error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1, as amended in 1973. Defendant sought to arrest the judgment of conviction and sentence by the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, State of Louisiana, on the grounds that &sect; 14:30.1 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without eligibility for parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for a period of 20 years. Defendant argued that &sect; 14:30.1 was unconstitutional because it encroached upon the governor's powers to grant pardons to first offenders, pursuant to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 10. The court held that the pardoning power vested in the governor was not encroached upon by the second-degree murder penalty provision. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 made no mention of pardon and did not contain a restriction on the governor's powers. The court held that the portion of La. Const. art. V, &sect; 10, which provided for eligibility for pardon for a first felony offender upon completion of his sentence, was not intended to apply to first felony offenders who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant's equal protection argument failed because there was no showing that all first offenders sentenced to life were not treated equally. Relying on its opinion in an earlier case, the court rejected defendant's argument that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees and defendant, a City, sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Caddo, State of Louisiana which reversed the decision of the lower court that sustained the City's pleas of prescription, overruled the pleas of estoppel by laches, and rendered judgment in favor of the employees' who earned overtime wages within one year prior to their action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several officers who for several years had worked 12 hour shifts and were paid overtime at their usual salary, discovered La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2213 that purported to require that policemen working 48 hours a week, must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their usual salaries for the overtime hours. The officers then filed an action to recover the difference between the wages they received for the overtime and the amount they should have received. The lower court sustained the City's plea of prescription, and rendered judgment in favor of the employees who earned overtime wages within one year prior to their action. The appellate court reversed the lower court ruling that sustained the City's exception of prescription and applied the doctrine of estoppel by laches to disallow the employees' claims for overtime pay for hours worked prior to January 1, 1970. On appeal the major issue was whether the home rule charter of the City precluded the application of &sect; 33:2213. On appeal the court reversed and reinstated the lower court decision. The court held that the City was without the authority to regulate overtime pay for policeman to the exclusion of &sect; 33:2213.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape after the introduction of deposition testimony of a witness, the attendance of whom the State had made no effort to secure. Defendant appealed and the court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. The court found that the constitutional right of confrontation was so important that the State could not introduce the deposition testimony unless it had made a good-faith and diligent effort to obtain the presence at the trial of the out-of-state witness. The court found that there was no showing that the State had attempted to contact the witness, nor that it was unable to do so, nor that it was unable to locate the witness in another state. Therefore, defendant's right to confrontation had been abused, despite the State's argument that defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at a previous trial. The court could not find the error harmless under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 921 because the violation was a substantial violation of a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the state's motion to amend the indictment, but granted its motion for mistrial. Afterward the state filed a motion to correct the indictment, which the trial court granted. Defendant filed a motion to quash the corrected indictment on the ground that double jeopardy barred the new prosecution. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant sought certiorari review. The court held that the indictment was a valid one for manslaughter, and there was no legal defect in the indictment that would render any judgment reversible as a matter of law, according to La.

Defendant argued that intense questioning by the prosecutor into the feelings of the jurors toward the death penalty unduly influenced them to adopt a severe attitude towards defendant. The court noted that defendant was found guilty without capital punishment and that the death penalty statutes were struck down soon after defendant's trial. The court found no error. Defendant also argued that the victim's husband could not express his opinion concerning the time of the victim's death. The court held that his testimony that he received a phone call from the victim was proper to establish that she was alive at that time, and that testimony regarding the call was not hearsay. Defendant also argued that the State did not properly establish the chain of custody for the dog leash used to strangle the victim. The court held that the leash was properly identified, and that any deficiencies in the chain of custody went to the weight of evidence, not its admissibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:82, the crime of prostitution must be committed by a woman. A man practicing sex with women for compensation did not commit the crime. Defendant was a female charged with prostitution under the statute. She contended that there was no rational basis for punishing women and not men for engaging in sexual intercourse for compensation. On review, the court held that defendant presented no evidence to support her position. The court stressed that in order to sustain defendant's contention the court would have to assume that the classification was implicit in the statute was unreasonable. The court held that the burden was on defendant to show that the classification was unreasonable and to support that contention with facts that would overcome the presumption of constitutionality. The court could not suppose that male prostitution was a problem of such significance that the legislature should make it a crime. The Equal Protection Clause did not require the legislature to regulate a practice that was not detrimental to public welfare in order to regulate an existing practice. No precedent required a finding of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was no general pretrial discovery and that defendant's discovery was limited to specific instances provided by statute. Defendant argued that the heroin was illegally seized. The court rejected defendant's argument because the heroin was not seized; it was purchased by an undercover agent. Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motions for continuance, refusing to issue a bench warrant, and controlling interrogation of witnesses. The court found no abuse of discretion. Defendant argued that it was error to permit the State to ask a defense witness why defendant was under his supervision as a probation officer. The court noted that defendant had called the witness and elicited testimony that he knew defendant from the performance of his duties. The court held that there was no error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Quachita Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of distribution of marijuana, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966 (1972), and sentenced him to three years at hard labor, suspended, and a fine. The trial court denied motions for a directed verdict, to suppress the marijuana, and to quash the indictment. Defendant primarily relied on the defense of entrapment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fellow student befriended defendant and spoke with him often about his own use of marijuana. One day, defendant responded to his request for marijuana because he was going to a concert by giving the friend his own at cost. The court opined that it was limited in its appellate review and could not say that the jury erred, even though there was fairly strong testimony that the friend/informer induced the crime. It noted that the trial court apparently gave a full charge of entrapment. Insofar as the motions charged that the indictment was defective in not charging which type of marijuana was distributed, the contention was without merit. The expert testimony established that marijuana had only one genus and one species, which was sometimes denoted as &quot;cannabis sativa L.&quot; The court dismissed defendant's argument that the indictment did not charge an offense because Schedule I did not set forth &quot;controlled dangerous substances,&quot; but only set out &quot;controlled substances.&quot; The court pointed to the definitional section of the statute,&nbsp;&sect; 40:961(7), which defined a &quot;controlled dangerous substance&quot; as one of the drugs listed in Schedules I through IV of &sect; 40:963.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged orders of the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo, (Louisiana), which granted one defendant's motion to quash the bill of information, finding that Schedule III(A)(2) of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:964 was unconstitutional. A second defendant, who had entered a guilty plea, was granted an arrest of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' expert chemist testified that there were numerous isomers of methamphetamine, and that some isomers were included in the manufacture of commercial compounds sold without a prescription. Apparently based upon that testimony, the trial court concluded that the phrase &quot;including its isomers,&quot; as used in &sect; 40:964, Schedule III(A)(2), was vague, indefinite, and overly broad. However, the State's expert testified that the statute concerned only the &quot;D&quot; and &quot;L&quot; isomers, and it was only those isomers that were reported by chemists with experience in the field of controlled dangerous substances. The court considered the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law as a whole, pursuant to &sect; 14:3, and concluded that the trial judge's ruling was erroneous. The court concluded that &quot;including its isomers&quot; meant not only those methamphetamine isomers that were subject to abuse, but also those that had a stimulant effect on the central nervous system. Hence, the language of Schedule III(A)(2) of &sect; 40:964 was not vague or overly broad; it provided an adequate warning to a person of ordinary intelligence as to the particular conduct that the section made criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the trial court granting one defendant's motion to quash and granting the other defendant's motion in arrest of judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the information did not set out the essential elements of aggravated burglary. The court held that it more than satisfied the short form set out in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 465. The trial court denied defendant's oral motions for a court reporter, that he be declared an indigent, and for the taking of &quot;live testimony&quot; that he was an indigent. The motions were made after the State had rested its case. The court opined that, as it understood defendant's contention, he was unable to obtain a transcript unless he paid for it, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:968(D). That he refused to do. Under those circumstances, the court would not disturb the discretion of the trial judge. Further, defendant had retained counsel and his failure to timely and properly move to proceed as an indigent was not attributable to the State. The court held that the State's use of peremptory challenges for the alleged purpose of excluding members of defendant's race from the jury was not subject to review. Finally, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 60 was not vague and inhumanly harsh, and defendant did not preserve for review his complaint about the prosecutor's closing argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police saw defendant, who they did not know, leave a residence that was known to be an outlet for drugs. When the police car pulled up beside defendant, she put her hand inside the waistband of her pants. After defendant again reached in her pants, an officer observed what he thought to be a glassine envelope in her hand. The officers grabbed defendant's hand and removed two glassine envelopes filled with what was later shown to be heroin. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress should have been granted.Although the police had probable cause to arrest defendant when the officers saw the glassine envelope in her hand, the police acted before they saw the envelope. The police did not have sufficient grounds to stop defendant merely because they saw her exit from a residence which they knew as a drug outlet. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215.1 could not be constitutionally applied in this case because it conflicted with the Fourth Amendment. Police officers could not actively create &quot;street encounters&quot; unless they had knowledge of suspicious facts and circumstances sufficient to allow them to infringe on the suspect's right to be free from governmental interference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroads were assessed an ad valorem tax by a waterway district created to establish and maintain a navigable waterway system. The railroads alleged that the waterway district tax was unconstitutional because it omitted three parishes along the river and because the parishes were assessed taxes on varying and unequal percentages of the property value. The court held that because there were reasonable grounds for excluding the three parishes where they would not receive any substantial benefits from the project, the railroads failed to prove unfair discrimination against the parishes included. The unequal assessment practices in the parishes did not violate La. Const. Art. X, &sect; 1 (1921) or deny them due process and the equal protection of the laws because the valuation method was an accepted mode of arriving at the &quot;value&quot; for tax purposes of utility property. The procedures for valuation and assessment of railroad utility property were not violated, and the requirement of uniform taxation was followed. The separate classification of railroad utilities for valuation was not arbitrary, nor did it result in an unfairly disproportionate tax burden violating any federal right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information as a third offender with unlawfully operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages. Defendant had been previously charged in separate bills of information with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages on two separate dates. He was arraigned on both of the prior charges, pleaded guilty, and sentenced. Defendant also pleaded guilty unlawfully operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages as a second offender. The third offender charge was based upon defendant's prior convictions, both of which involved sentences of imprisonment. The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash the third offender charge. On appeal, the court noted that, at the time of the previous pleas, defendant was not advised of his right to counsel, was not represented by counsel, and was not advised of the consequences of his plea. The court held that the prior convictions could not be urged in the subsequent prosecution, and held that the motion to quash should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to quash his indictment for first degree murder, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30(4) (amended 1973), on the ground that the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and that &sect; 14:30(4) was unconstitutional. The district court sustained the motion. On appeal the court reversed and maintained the indictment. The court held that capital punishment per se was not constitutionally proscribed because the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution sanctioned the death penalty if imposed with due process of law. The court further held that the death penalty for first degree murder in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 (amended 1973) contained no constitutional infirmity. The use of lesser verdicts was contingent on the jury finding insufficient evidence to convict on the defendant's charge of first degree murder. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 817 (amended 1973) prohibited qualification of a guilty verdict, but the jury was to have no sentencing function defendant would have been subject to the death penalty only if found guilty as charged with first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for aggravated rape, relying on five bills of exceptions. The court found no merit in the bills and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, especially in the light of the seriousness of the crime and the necessity for grand jury assessment of the charge. The reasons for the delay were not shown to have been due to any procrastination or unwillingness to try the case on the part of the State; the charges were initially weighed by preliminary examination and grand jury as quickly as possible; defendant's motion for a speedy trial was considered relatively quickly after filing, and he was tried three months after his request for a speedy trial. The court also held that his motion to suppress his confession was properly denied. There was no authority providing that the confession was inadmissible on the ground that the vagrancy statute under which defendant was initially arrested was allegedly unconstitutional or of borderline application because no coercive police procedures negated the free and voluntary nature of the confession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ten companies established a profit-sharing plan and trust for their employees' benefit. The trustee applied to the IRS for a determination as to the effect of each company's termination in the plan. The IRS found that, as to one company, the plan had terminated four years earlier and that certain funds allocated to that company's employees should have been held vested and distributed at that time. This interpretation implicated, among other things, proper allocation of benefits to certain employees. The trustee asked the district court ex parte to interpret the trust and instruct the trustee as to whether the IRS's interpretation of the trust was correct. The district court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2233 impermissibly allowed the judiciary to render an advisory opinion where no justiciable controversy existed. The court found no authority for this conclusion. The legislature was not prohibited from vesting jurisdiction in district courts to interpret trust agreements on the application of trustees.

Ann. art. 5096, the wife's divorce petition in forma pauperis to have the trial court appoint an attorney, without cost to her, to represent defendant husband, alleged to have been a non-resident, for the purpose of service of process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This suit began as an action for divorce in forma pauperis. The petition for divorce sought the appointment of an attorney to represent the husband, alleged to have been a non-resident. Upon learning that the indigent wife could pay neither the fee nor the expenses of an appointed attorney, the trial court refused to order such an appointment. The court of appeal affirmed. The court reversed and held that the laws of the state grant the wife, as an indigent plaintiff in a divorce action against an absent defendant, the right to a determination of the merits of her suit by assuring the requisite notice and service of process. The lower courts' interpretation of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5096, requiring payment of attorney's fees by the wife, effectively deprived an indigent plaintiff proceeding against an absent defendant in a divorce action due process and equal protection of the laws. Since art. 5096, provided that fees due attorneys were taxed as costs of court, and indigents are exempt from prepaying costs of court, payment of the attorney's fees could not have been a condition precedent to the attorney's appointment by the court in forma pauperis proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the lower courts and remanded the cause to the trial court for the appointment of an attorney to represent the absent husband, and for subsequent proceedings in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:30 and sentenced to life imprisonment. In affirming the decision, the court held that denial of defendant's motion to quash the general jury venire was properly denied. The exclusion of women from the jury venire was not an unconstitutional denial of defendant's rights. Second, the objection to defense questions designed to show that the victim made threats against defendant was properly sustained. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:482, before threats of the victim against defendant could be shown, an adequate showing of a hostile demonstration or overt act on the part of the victim should have been made, which defendant failed to do. Third, although the res gestae doctrine represented an exception to the hearsay rule, threats, when offered in connection with a plea of self-defense, were non-hearsay and res gestae had no application to them. Fourth, defendant's taped statement was properly introduced because defendant turned himself in and voluntarily agreed to make a statement.

Second, defendants had no standing to attack La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court obtained a judgment ordering the Board to issue a birth certificate to a minor designating her race as white. When the Board issued only a short form birth registration card, the minor's father filed a petition to compel compliance with the judgment and to hold &sect; 42:267&nbsp;unconstitutional on the ground that it provided no definitions for the terms used and referred only to persons of &quot;Negro&quot; blood. The court held that the district court did not err in ordering the Board, through the parish registrar, to issue the certified copy of the certificate of the minor's live birth. However, the court held that the district court erred in holding &sect; 42:267&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 42:267 was not null because of invidious racial discrimination or so vague that it could not have been administered. The court held that the district court was unwarranted in assuming that the Board was required to take some action in racial designation based on the terms used in &sect; 42:267, which prohibited the use of such racial terms unless the person had more than one-thirty-second &quot;Negro&quot; blood.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 764, as the investigator was not a witness; (4) the amendment to the bill of information did not constitute a substantive defect, as it merely amplified the statement of additional facts that were not necessary to the charging language; and (5) the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, as defendant was aware of two of the five newly discovered witnesses but made no effort to call those witnesses and the information leading to the discovery of the other witnesses was within defendant's possession prior to trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the bill of information was so vague and indefinite that it did not inform him of the nature and cause of the charge against him as required by La.

At the time of the amended information, the statute had been amended and renumbered as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966. Defendant argued that information's reference to a violation of La. Rev.

The court determined that the statutory designation was not misleading and did not render the amended information vague or uncertain. The court concluded that the parenthetical reference was obviously the subsequent statutory designation of the offense charged in the original indictment.

The court affirmed and held that the provision exempting women from jury service was at the woman's option. The court held also that the district attorney was permitted to explain the law of conspiracy in his opening statement as it could have been relevant and that the district attorney did not have to go into detail about the crime, but was to outline the case in his opening. The court further held that the trial court did not err in permitting the State to supply testimony of four of its witnesses by transcript from the previous trial since they were unavailable to testify: two were not able to be located, one was located but turned out to be the wrong person, and the fourth refused to testify based on her Fifth Amendment right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction and sentence of the Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Madison (Louisiana). He was charged with having committed aggravated rape upon two women, aged 17 and 16. Defendant was tried and found guilty of the crime charged. He was sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two victims were on a sandbar with two male companions when defendant approached them. The offense took place at night. Defendant claimed to be a deputy sheriff. He represented that he had a gun and ordered the males to stay by the edge of the water while he took the young women into some bushes. He then ordered them to disrobe and there raped them. According to the testimony of the victims and their male companions, defendant threatened to shoot and kill the victims unless they submitted. Defendant urged, among other alleged errors on appeal, not that the death penalty per se was unconstitutional, but that the imposition of the death penalty in the instant case constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for aggravated rape, as the death penalty for such crime was constitutionally permissible. The court concluded, inter alia, that the death penalty for aggravated rape was not cruel and unusual punishment, and thus did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Nor did the imposition of the death penalty for aggravated rape violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which, in the taxpayers' action to recover state income taxes paid under protest, held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:55(5) (1970) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that &sect; 47:55(5), which disallowed a deduction for federal income taxes paid in computing net income for purposes of the state income tax, violated La. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The constitutional provision authorized the levy of taxes only on net income. The taxpayers argued that denying a deduction for federal income taxes paid amounted to a tax on something other than net income. The trial court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:55(5) was constitutional. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that the legislature had the discretion in defining net income to provide for deductions from gross income which would constitute such income, as long as reasonable and ordinary expenses were allowed as deductions in computing net income. The court held that there was no legal authority that the taxes on net income paid by a taxpayer to one taxing authority are necessarily expenses deductible in determining the net income taxable by another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the judgment from the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which sustained defendant's motion to quash an indictment for second-degree murder that charged a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1(1). Defendant had argued that the enactment of 1973 La. Acts 111 during a fiscal session was unconstitutional and the Act failed to conform to requirements of La. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 16, 17 and 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1973 La. Acts 111 amended Title 14 of the Revised Statutes of 1950 by adding a new section designated as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 to define the crime of second degree murder. Defendant argued that the Act was passed in a fiscal session of the Louisiana Legislature without the necessary votes for its enactment, contrary to La. Const. art. III, &sect; 8.Defendant claimed that a three-fourths vote was required by La. Const. art. III, &sect; 8, both to extend the fiscal session to consider non-fiscal matters and to enact any non-fiscal matter into law at that session. The defense relied upon the decision in Sullins v. City of Shreveport, 252 La. 423, 211 So. 2d 314 (1968). On appeal, the court held that insofar as that language of Sullins conflicted with the decision in the instant case it was overruled. 1973 La. Acts 111 was free of any constitutional infirmity. The procedure followed for its enactment was in full conformity with La. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 8 and 24. It received a three-fourths vote to extend the session and a majority vote for final passage. Also, the title of 1973 La. Acts 111 was not narrower than its body, nor was it an enactment by reference to other legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to quash, and the case was remanded to the trial court to be proceeded with in accordance with law and in keeping with the reasons assigned in the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Louisiana challenged a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), entered in favor of plaintiffs, an unincorporated association of non-franchised used-automobile dealers and two individual association members. The district court held that &sect; 15 of the Louisiana Consumer Credit Law (Law), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:3510 through :3568, violated La. Const. Article III, Section 16 (1921).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action, citation and service on the State was made through the Attorney General. The district court found that the challenged provision violated the requirement that a statute's title had to indicate its object. The court disagreed with the State's claim that plaintiffs had no right to declaratory relief, holding that the action was justiciable. Plaintiffs had an interest to be adjudicated because, as non-franchised motor vehicle dealers, they had suffered competitive injury under the Law as against franchised new car dealers, whom the Law specifically exempted. The State, acting through the attorney general, was a proper party defendant, and there was sufficient adversity between plaintiffs and the State. The court held that the Law was not unconstitutional to the extent it reflected the original bill. Its title was sufficient to give notice that it affected all consumer credit transactions, including those pertaining to motor vehicles. The action was remanded to permit joinder of appropriate representatives of factory-franchised new motor vehicle dealers to allow determination of the constitutionality of their exemption from the Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part the district court judgment that had held a provision of the Law to be unconstitutional, although it affirmed its holding that declaratory relief was available. The action was remanded to the district court to allow plaintiffs to join as parties defendant representatives of factory-franchised new motor vehicle dealers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the district court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial on the basis that the district attorney had allegedly made prejudicial racial remarks. The court held that the remarks complained of were to the effect that the lounge where the shooting occurred was having racial problems. Given the apparently vicious, &quot;night-riding&quot; nature of the shooting and killing, the remarks and subsequent testimony relative to the racial problems at the lounge were relevant to show motive for the incident. Further, the court stated that there was nothing inflammatory in the manner in which the remarks were made and the evidence presented. The court held that there was no prejudice in the admission of various items of evidence. Also, the denial of a directed verdict and the denial of a new trial were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By way of an appeal and an application for writs of certiorari in the consolidated cases, defendant Louisiana Board of Regents challenged the judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which declared 1972 La. Acts 712 unconstitutional in its entirety and issued a permanent injunction that prohibited implementation of the act. The issue was whether the act conflicted with La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue of an alleged conflict was presented between 1972 La. Acts 712 and La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7, where the legislative act was enacted under the purported authority of another constitutional provision, La. Const. art. III, &sect; 32. The court concluded that there was no provision in the Constitution or otherwise, except as contained in La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7, which authorized the legislature to pass a statute that conflicted with the complete autonomy of the Louisiana State University Board (L.S.U. Board), as provided in Article XII, &sect; 7(A). Article XII, &sect; 7 contained no provision that authorized the legislature to merge and consolidate the L.S.U. Board with any other board or commission. Hence, 1972 La. Acts 712 was in direct conflict with La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7(A) insofar as it attempted to abolish the L.S.U. Board and to transfer all direction, control, supervision, and management of university to a new board. To this extent, the act was clearly unconstitutional.The unconstitutional portion was so interrelated and connected with the other portions of the act that 1972 La. Acts 712 was declared to be unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in the consolidated cases. However, having decided the consolidated cases on the appeal, the issue presented in the application for writs was rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens brought an action to enjoin an election on the proposed new Constitution for the State of Louisiana. The citizens also sought to have declared null and void an Act that provided for the Constitutional Convention.

The court rejected this assertion because, although the people were required to approve any Constitution, there was no requirement that the people approve the Constitutional Convention to work on the instrument. The citizens also asserted that the existence of 27 appointed delegates out of a total of 132 violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that this requirement did not apply to a Constitutional Convention, which neither legislated nor governed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which, following a jury trial, convicted him of murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 and sentenced him to the department of corrections for the rest of his natural life. The sentence was to be served without the benefit of probation, parole, commutation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 817 was unconstitutional in that it violated La. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 by allowing the jury to qualify a guilty verdict in capital cases by imposing a life sentence without benefit of parole, probation, commutation, or suspension of sentence, thus denying the Governor of Louisiana the right to commute the sentence. Defendant also claimed that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 817 was unconstitutional in that it violated the guarantee of due process and the guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment found in La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2, 12. On appeal, the court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 817 conflicted with La. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 because La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 817 permitted a verdict denying defendant the right to commutation of sentence, whereas the constitution empowered the governor to commute sentences in all cases not involving impeachment or treason. The court ruled that the Louisiana Constitution was the supreme law of the state, and art. 817 could not stand insofar as it conflicted with the constitution. Defendant's conviction was upheld, but the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder, but annulled and set aside the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence and ordered her to be discharged. The parish ordinance prohibited the sale of beverages containing more than one-half of one percent of alcohol by volume. The court held that the ordinance exceeded the state legislative delegation of power because it was an exercise of a local option on a parish-wife basis in contravention of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:582, it purported to prohibit beverages with an alcoholic content, which under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:588 could not be regulated locally, and the penalties under the ordinance exceeded those allowed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:595. The court found that the savings clause of 1948 La. Acts. 372, &sect; 17 was repealed by the enactment of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950 and that La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, the court ruled that the decision of the lower federal court was not binding on the state courts and that the women's exemption from jury service was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with armed robbery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. After trial by jury in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), he was found guilty and sentenced to serve 16 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence, relying on four bills of exceptions for reversal thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two bills related to the contention that the exemption of women from jury service contained in La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 41 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 402 violated the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. However, the provisions of Louisiana law inhibiting jury service by women were previously held constitutional. The third bill was reserved to the overruling of defendant's motion for a new trial, based on his contention that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence, in that testimony was conflicting and insufficient for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. As the motion was basically leveled at the sufficiency of the evidence, it presented nothing for the court's review. The fourth bill was taken when the trial judge refused to allow a letter allegedly written by defendant's sister to have been read to the jury when she was on cross-examination. The import of the letter was that, although she would testify for the State and against defendant, her testimony was untrue. Even assuming error was committed, it was harmless, as defense counsel ultimately achieved the introduction of the letter. Hence, defendant suffered no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted and sentenced to 30 days in jail on each charge. On appeal to the intermediate court, the convictions were affirmed but the sentence as to the trespass charge was remanded to be reduced to the maximum 20-day sentence. On subsequent appeal, the court affirmed and remanded to the intermediate court for imposition of the legal sentence. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional, that the indictment furnished complete notice and understanding of the proceeding, that defendant was not misled or misinformed to his prejudice making the indictment sufficient, but that trial de novo required sentencing by the judge presiding at that trial, the sentence being an integral part of the conviction obtained in the trial de novo.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking to enforce its regulatory powers with regard to price-fixing under the Orderly Milk Marketing Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:940.1-.23, the Commission sought to enjoin the supermarket from giving or offering to give refunds in connection with purchases of milk and dairy products. The trial court granted a limited injunction, but the appellate court broadened the injunction somewhat so as to enjoin refunds even on the limited basis allowed by the trial court. The supermarket brought a writ of certiorari. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment and reinstated the trial court's decision. The court held that whatever contention the Commission could have that the refund offer, even so limited, was a disruptive trade practice and constituted illegal price competition was not so sufficiently shown in the record to justify the substitution of the court's appellate judgment for the trial court's sound discretion. The court rejected the Commission's argument that the refund-offer campaign was more of an advertising gimmick in the nature of subtle price-competition.</SPAN></P>

The record and the briefs filed in the court indicated that defendant did not directly commit the act which resulted in the death of the victim. Defendant was charged with murder and convicted with manslaughter. She sought review arguing that the indictment under which she was charged was defective because it did not include all the essential elements of the lesser offense of manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the presence of passion was not an additional element of the crime of manslaughter, rather, it was a factor that exhibited a degree of culpability less than that present when the homicide was committed without passion caused by provocation. The court concluded that a verdict of manslaughter could readily be seen as responsive to a charge of murder. The court held that responsiveness of a verdict of manslaughter in a murder prosecution was expressly provided by the legislature under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 814.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial defendant announced his intention to testify in his own behalf, and filed a motion to prohibit the district attorney from using his prior conviction of burglary for impeachment purposes. The trial judge, relying upon La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:495, overruled the motion. Defendant was convicted of simple burglary, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62, and appealed. Defendant contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:495 was unconstitutional because it deprived an accused of due process and equal protection of the laws. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that Louisiana jurisprudence had not limited impeachment testimony to recent crimes, nor to crimes indicative of the credibility of the witness or of the testifying defendant. Further the court held, a witness who took the witness stand in his own behalf waived his privilege against self incrimination, and was subject to cross-examination and impeachment in the same manner as any other witness. Lastly, defendant's prior conviction was not too remote in time to be irrelevant. The jury was capable of assigning a proper weight to such evidence affecting defendant's credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court, Jefferson Parish (Louisiana), entered after a trial before a five-man jury, that convicted him of violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:69 (1950) by receiving stolen things with knowledge that they had been stolen. He received a sentence of one year in the parish prison, suspended, and payment of a fine. His motion to suppress certain evidence was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a search pursuant to a warrant, several items were found in defendant's home two days after they were stolen. The warrant was supported by a police officer's affidavit providing information that he had obtained from two other officers, indicating that the officers had recovered other property stolen at the same time with the help of a confidential informant who had previously helped them solve other burglaries, who had led them to discover that the rest of the stolen property was at defendant's home, and who had advised them that defendant was a &quot;fence.&quot; The affiant had also observed a known burglar entering defendant's home. The court affirmed the judgment. Although the affidavit was based in large part on hearsay, it set forth underlying circumstances and details sufficient to provide a substantial factual basis by which the magistrate could have found the informant and his information to be reliable. Defendant was properly penalized under the version of &sect; 14:69 in effect on the date of his crime rather than according to less severe penalties that took effect afterward under an amendment in 1972 La. Acts 654. Defendant's remaining bills of exception were without merit.</SPAN></P>

City of New Orleans, et al., 263 La. 649, 269 So. 2d 194, the issues raised in this case were adjudicated. The court held that the action by the commission was not barred, however, because the commission was not involved in the prior actions, was not in privity with the City, and did not sleep on its rights. Additionally, because the commission's constitutionally vested rights, powers, and authority were adversely affected by those decrees, the commission had the right to collaterally attack those judgments. The court overruled those actions, and Louisiana Civil Service League, et al. v. Forbes, 258 La. 390, 246 So. (2d) 800, to the extent that they held that the acts were constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted a writ of certiorari to the First Judicial District Court, Caddo Parish, (Louisiana), to review an enhanced sentence that was imposed on him 19 months after he completed serving his sentence for the crime of attempted simple robbery. After defendant was released from jail, he pleaded guilty to being a fourth time offender as charged by the State. Defendant was resentenced and unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was confronted with the issue of whether an enhanced penalty could be imposed after defendant served his sentence on the underlying charge. The court found that even though an earlier case had permitted this, a case must end at some point. Every person who was convicted of two or more felonies needed assurance that after some passage of time, the consequences of past criminal acts had abated. An interpretation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D) that would allow the state to bring a felon into court at any time for resentencing was too open ended. Thus, the court determined that a proceeding to have defendant sentenced as a multiple offender was to be conducted before defendant completed the sentence that was to be enhanced. The court rejected the contention that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 was unconstitutional on its face. This statute did not make it a crime to be a multiple offender. It merely prescribed that an enhanced penalty was to be levied against multiple offenders. The court further found that by pleading guilty to a bill of information filed under the statute, an accused was only admitting the allegations contained within the bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the district court and ordered that the defendant discharged from custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), which convicted defendant of simple burglary, La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of simple burglary and the trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial after a remark by a police officer witness, under cross-examination by the defendant's counsel. This remark included an oblique reference to previous arrests of some &quot;subjects.&quot; Defendant perfected one bill of exceptions with regard to the denial of the mistrial, claiming that the officer was a &quot;court official&quot; that had made a comment about a prior crime of defendant and therefore a mistrial was warranted under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770. The court affirmed and held that, in light of the entire cross-examination of the officer by defendant's counsel, the oblique reference did not require a mistrial. The court examined on its own motion the sufficiency of the indictment, because the state failed to describe what defendant had burglarized, but only referred to the burglary of a &quot;movable&quot; owned by the victim.

</DIV>

On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court was not empowered to prevent enforcement of the statute by injunction. The court noted that the statute was criminal in nature and its enforcement as well as its constitutionality should be determined in a criminal proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after selling heroin and convicted of heroin distribution. He sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court, however, set aside the sentence because defendant was sentenced without benefit of the statutory delay provided in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873. The court held that the State had not made improper remarks in its opening statement because La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 766 did not require that all evidence had to be given in minute detail. The court found that the fact that an erroneous date was given for one of the offenses was unimportant because defendant was apprised sufficiently of the general nature of the evidence to be introduced. The court concluded that a ruling of a trial court on a motion for a bill of particulars would not be disturbed in the absence of an abuse of discretion and that such an abuse had not occurred. The court rejected defendant's argument that the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act was incomprehensible to the average person further and held that all that was required was that the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what conduct was criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot his wife in a shopping center. Defendant was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced accordingly. Defendant appealed and raised several issues concerning his trial. On review, the court found that the district attorney properly served in the prosecution of the case. The court examined several arguments concerning the impaneling of the jury and determined that, under the then existing law, the jury selection process and makeup was appropriate. Also, the court noted that the prosecutor's opening statement was not evidence subject to objection at the time, but simply was a statement of what he intended to prove, not how it was to be proven. Also, photographs of the dead wife were not overly gruesome and were admissible. The court observed that defendant admitted shooting his wife and that his real defense was insanity at the time of the commission of the offense and that defendant failed to satisfactorily establish the defense. Also, the court used the proper test for insanity. The court concluded that defendant received a fair and impartial trial and none of the issues brought by defendant brought a conclusion to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On application of defendant Louisiana Collector of Revenue, the court issued a writ of review directed to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit (Louisiana), which affirmed a district judgment holding La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:601, as amended by 1970 La. Acts 325, unconstitutional as a violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 47:601, as amended, the Collector sought to levy a corporation franchise tax on plaintiff pipeline company, which had pipeline maintenance facilities and employees within Louisiana but conducted no intrastate shipping. On review, the court noted that the court of appeal had held that the predecessor statute to &sect; 47:601, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:601, as amended by 1958 La. Acts 437, was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. In response to that decision, the legislature enacted 1970 La. Acts 325. The court held that the thrust of &sect; 47:601, as amended, was to tax not the interstate business done in Louisiana by a foreign corporation, but the doing of business in Louisiana in a corporate form. The court reviewed United States Supreme Court jurisprudence indicating inroads into the tax immune status of exclusively interstate activity. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:601 et seq. was a constitutional exercise of the State's taxing power that did not contravene the Commerce Clause. However, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:611, the pipeline company was entitled to a large reduction of the franchise tax for the first year &sect; 47:601, as amended, was in effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment holding the statute unconstitutional, amended the judgment such that a small corporate franchise tax was imposed on the pipeline company for the first year the statute was in effect and a full tax was imposed for the second year, and, as amended, affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment, in that the statute was unconstitutional, being in violation of U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, 3. The court agreed and reversed defendant's conviction and sentence. Explaining, the court noted that at time of trial the state supreme court had already unequivocally interpreted and applied the obscenity statute to prohibit the sale of all lascivious materials that could constitutionally be prohibited under safeguards set by the United States Supreme Court. While the case was pending on appeal, however, that court handed down an opinion regarding obscenity statutes that clearly rendered the Louisiana statute unconstitutional. Thus, the court declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(2) to be unconstitutional and ordered that defendant be discharged.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected this argument and affirmed the convictions. It held that the warrantless search was justified by the exigent circumstance of the defendants' imminent departure from the jurisdiction. The court further held that the officers were not precluded from relying on the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, where the police in their discretion chose to institute surveillance rather than to immediately obtain a search warrant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued the injunction against the theatre, and it appealed the ruling. The court held that &sect; 13:4712 declared any place a nuisance where there exists prostitution or obscenity as defined by the criminal laws of the State. The court stated that the clear language of &sect; 13:4712 mandated that a temporary injunction shall be granted by the judge upon the simple allegation by the district attorney upon information and belief of the existence of obscenity without any requirement of a showing upon probable cause that obscenity was being published in some manner. The court determined that under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, there could be no seizure of an allegedly obscene expression without a prior judicial determination of an adequate factual basis for a probability that the expression constituted obscenity.

The court entered a judgment permanently enjoining the theaters from showing any version of the film. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the court's judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration. On remand, the court noted that it had declared La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the beds or bottoms of all navigable waters in the State, whether lakes, rivers, or streams, belonged to the State by virtue of its inherent sovereignty. However, the court stated that the land lying between the ordinary low water mark and the ordinary high water mark was called the bank of the stream and belonged to the owner of the adjacent land, subject to the use by the public, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 455 and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 457. The court determined that because the body of water was a lake and not a river, the owners did not have alluvial rights to the land since the body was water was a great size, irregularly shaped, and deemed to be a lake at the time the State joined the union.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a Thirty-Third Judicial District Court, Parish of Allen (Louisiana) judgment, convicting him of aggravated rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed, and the court held that no evidence of purposeful discrimination in the selection of the jury venire existed. There had been no showing of discrimination, fraud or collusion resulting in prejudice to the accused. Excusing prospective jurors in advance of time of trial was within the discretion of the trial court. There was no requirement the concurrence of the grand jurors should be manifested by their signatures on the indictment. Further, 11 jurors returned an indictment as a true bill. This action met the requirements. The court found that the exercise of peremptory challenges was not subject to judicial review. Further, the indictment substantially complied with statutory requirements, and the addition of other language did not affect its sufficiency. Finally, the court determined that the evidentiary issues raised by defendant did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that defendant was deemed pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 555 to have waived his right to be present at his arraignment because defendant entered upon trial without objecting to the defect. The court ruled that the bill of information, which cited only La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27 as the statute violated, contained adequate language to properly charge defendant under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 465. The court concluded that items of clothing and photographs of the scene were properly admitted into evidence because lack of a positive identification of the clothing went to the weight of the evidence and a six-month delay between the offense and the taking of the photographs was immaterial in the absence of a showing that the photographs did not accurately depict the scene as it existed at the time of the offense. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defense counsel's motion to withdraw, which was filed after the trial court held defense counsel in contempt, because the trial court made every effort to reassure counsel of the trial court's impartiality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the grand jury indicted three defendants for murder, they were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death. They appealed. The court noted that prior to trial, the defense filed motions for production of exculpatory evidence. The State answered that it had no evidence, which the trial judge upheld. The court held that the defense was embarking upon a fishing expedition. It held that there was no error where the prosecution failed, in answer to a request, to produce exculpatory evidence when no exculpatory evidence was possessed. Further, there was no need to severe defendants or provide individual counsel at trial where two defendants did not take the stand nor did they call witnesses in an attempt to establish either a defense or alibi. There was no antagonism or conflict in their defenses or a need to appoint separate counsel. Finally, as the state's death penalty was found unconstitutional in Furman, these defendants could not be punished by death.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 56:123(H)(2), which prohibited the hunting of deer at night and the hunting of deer during closed season. Defendant contended that La. Rev. Stat.

Defendant also contended that the mandatory penalty provisions of &sect; 56:123(H) were in direct conflict with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894 and that the penalty provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 123(H) prohibiting suspension of sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 56:123 was unconstitutional as clearly unfounded. The court ruled that La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission, appealed the adverse judgment of the Thirty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of Terrebonne (Louisiana), that declared La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A class action was filed on behalf of plaintiffs, shrimpers, trawlers, dealers, processors, and canners engaged in the taking, possessing, processing, transporting, buying, and selling of salt water shrimp, to have declared unconstitutional&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:498, the shrimp count law, and to enjoin its enforcement by the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission. Following a trial, the district court granted a preliminary injunction and deemed the statute to be unconstitutional. The Wildlife Commission appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that the district court erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional. The argument that shrimp taken from &quot;outside waters,&quot; waters off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, was subject to prosecution under &sect; 56:498 was erroneous, for only the taking and possession of shrimp from inland waters was controlled by that statute. Therefore, the class could not be prosecuted for taking shrimp in the outside waters and transporting them through inside waters for processing. The state legislature had the authority to regulate shrimp in their fresh state as taken from state waters, and such regulation was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, the widow and children of the deceased mortgagor, sought review by a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Cameron Parish (Louisiana), which affirmed the judgment of the district court, dismissing their suit brought against respondent mortgagee to annul a sheriff's sale. The mortgagee had effected the judicial sale of immovable property by invoking executory proceedings under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2631-2644.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee procured an order for the sale, via executory proceedings, of the deceased mortgagor's property. The decedent's family did not oppose the sale or appeal from the judgment permitting it. The mortgagee purchased the property, consisting of 15 acres, for $ 300 at the sheriff's sale without an appraisal. The court reversed the judgments below, which dismissed the family's suit. The court opined that the executory process and the sale were vitiated as against them, as the mortgagee failed to strictly comply with the statutory requirements for executory proceedings, and he was still in possession of the property and had not sold the property to an innocent purchaser. The family's suit to annul the sale on grounds of procedural defects was brought within three months thereof. The court found that the mortgagee breached the requirements under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2637, by failing to prove by affidavit or verified petition the mortgagor's death and his children's heirship, or that an attorney had been appointed to represent the decedent's widow, as she was a non-resident.

Charges for gas on a credit card were signed with defendant's name, a tow truck operator identified him as the driver, and, at arrest, defendant had the car keys in his pocket. He was found guilty of theft, and the trial court sentenced defendant to nine years. Defendant appealed, and the court held that it was constitutional to exempt women from jury service. Further, the statutory presumption as to defendant's possession of the keys did no more than make possession of the keys prima facie evidence of guilt. It left defendant free to testify or not as he chose. As no pretrial motion to suppress was filed, the objection to unlawful seizure of the keys was waived. The record contained ample evidence from which the jury could infer that a theft occurred, and defendant had adequate information about the nature of the crime from the bill of particulars absent any abuse of discretion or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. Execution of the sentence was deferred pending application for writs, which were applied for on the ground that &sect; 14:59(7) was unconstitutional. The application was granted over the objection that the motion in arrest of judgment was not timely filed. Finding, ex proprio motu, a defect in the bill of information, the court found that the conviction and sentence had to be annulled and set aside. Specifically, the court found that the bill of information contained only conclusions of law and no basic facts constituting the offense. Because criminal mischief could not be charged by the short form, but had to be charged by the long form bill of information per La. Code Crim. Proc.

In answer, the taxpayer claimed that the method of computing the taxes as applied to it unconstitutionally violated his right to equal protection. Judgment was rendered against the taxpayer, he appealed to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, and the appeal was transferred to the court pursuant to La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer opened for business in October 1969. Its occupational license tax was to be paid in advance and computed by annualizing the income from the prior year. The taxpayer claimed that the application of the method for calculating the tax for 1970 deprived it of its right to equal protection. The taxpayer claimed that it had a seasonal business in which most of its revenue came in at the end of the year and that annualizing its 1969 revenue would overestimate its tax base. The court affirmed the judgment against the taxpayer, holding that the taxpayer failed to show any denial of equal protection rights. The court held that the taxpayer was in a class with other general retail merchandisers whose businesses were also presumably seasonal, that the ordinance for raising revenue was valid, that it was reasonable to treat commencing businesses differently from ongoing operations in calculating each tax base, and that the method of calculation was reasonable and applied equally to all those in the taxpayer's class. The court also held that the sheriff did not abuse its discretion in refusing to waive the penalty because the taxpayer's only excuse for not paying was oversight.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's main complaint was directed to the photographic identification procedure employed by the police. He alleged that there was a lack of physical similarity between his photograph and the other photographs that were shown to the witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, each witnesses who had made a photographic identification stated that he had viewed numerous photographs on the night of the robbery, but was unable to identify the perpetrators. Each witness was shown a number of photographs weeks later. All of the witnesses except one were unable to identify the perpetrators from this second group of photographs. Two weeks later, each witness was shown a third group of photographs, consisting of 19 pictures, including defendant. Each identified defendant as one of the robbers from this third group. Defendant complained that several of the photographs depicted persons with facial hair, which defendant lacked, or different hair styles from those worn by the perpetrators. The testimony established, however, that each witness was told that the robber's hair style or facial hair might have changed between the taking of the photograph and the robbery. The court examined the photographs and found that they were an extremely fair assemblage. Also, the procedure employed by the police was not suggestive. The witnesses were merely given a group of 19 photographs and asked if they recognized the robber.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:103.1, subd. A(1). The trial court quashed the indictment and the State appealed. On appeal, the court held that the United States Supreme Court had previously held that the statute was unconstitutional because it swept within its broad scope activities that were constitutionally protected free speech and assembly. The court stated that it was convinced that its previous interpretation of the statute was correct and in its opinion, the restructuring of the statute addressed itself to the legislature.

Defendant was charged with violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106 by possessing obscene material with intent to sell them. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the seized items and to return them to her.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 51:191 - 51:194 and, therefore, unconstitutional under La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 40(d) (1921).</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the ordinance was valid and enforceable and, thus, denied the owner's request for a permanent injunction against applicants. The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal, holding that the ordinance was without any force and effect because it was unconstitutional. The court found that the ordinance was inconsistent with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 51:191 - 51:194, the general statewide Sunday Closing Law, because &sect; 51:192 exempted supermarkets from the prohibition against doing business on Sunday.

Ann. &sect; 33:401A(7) gave the town the special authority to enact the ordinance to prevent desecration of the Sabbath. The court found that the ordinance's purpose was not to prevent desecration of the Sabbath and, thus, &sect; 33:401A(7) could not be used to sustain the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the city's arguments that the firemen had a maximum amount of work hours per week and that outside work subjected the city to increased liability. The court found that the ordinance was enacted in bad faith after the fireman instituted an action to compel the city to pay salary increases. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:402 and 1965, the city had the power to regulate the fire department, but subject to the requirement that the ordinance be reasonably adapted to a legitimate public end. The court found that outside employment did not interfere with the firemen's duties, that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it interfered with their right to work, and that the ordinance violated the due process provisions of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The police jury filed suit, as plaintiff below, against all taxpayers in an industrial district, seeking a judgment declaring certain special obligation revenue bonds to be valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reversing the judgment of the district court, the court of appeal had declared the Act of July 26, 1972, No. 433, La.

At issue was the validity of special obligation revenue bonds, which were issued by the policy jury pursuant to a state-approved lease with a corporation to control industrial pollution control. The bonds issued without an election. Defendant urged that the bonds were invalid, as the Act, which repealed the election requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:997, and dispensed with the necessity for public sale of such bonds, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:998, was unconstitutional. The court reversed and set aside the judgment of the court of appeal and reinstated the judgment of the district court. The court opined that the Act was a valid effective amendment of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which sustained defendant's motion to quash bills of information charging him with criminal defamation in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to quash, defendant alleged that the bills of information were defective because they did not state or allege an expression, publication, conduct, or speech denounced, proscribed, or made a crime by any valid statute. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:47, 14:48, 14:49 were unconstitutional as applied to public officers, public figures, or private individuals involved in public affairs. The court found that the statutes were in no way designed to prevent breaches of the peace in response to expressions constituting fighting words. Further, the court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:48 directed punishment for true statements made with actual malice. Additionally, the court found that a false statement concerning a public official could be punished if not made in the reasonable belief of its truth. Because it was clear from a reading of the statutes that truth was not a defense to a charge of defamation, the court held that the statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they attempted to punish public expression and publication concerning public officials, public figures, and private individuals who were engaged in public affairs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was killed by defendant in the course of his attempting to commit aggravated rape. Defendant was accused and convicted of murder and was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and raised a variety of errors which the court examined. The court found that the State sufficiently supplied the particulars to inform defendant of the nature and cause of the charge against him. The court observed that defendant's request for copies of all technical and laboratory reports and/or examination or description of all objects found or removed from the scene of the offense, and copies of all pictures made of the scene, were all items which were not subject to pre-trial discovery. The court found that an attack several years prior and the present crime were so similar that the evidence of the prior offense clearly served to illustrate the question of defendant's intent as to the attempted perpetration of aggravated rape. However, the court determined that the death penalty under Louisiana's felony-murder rule constituted cruel and unusual punishment and thus, the death sentence imposed could not be carried out. Rather, the defendant was remanded so that a life sentence could be imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for the crime of murder was affirmed; but the death sentence imposed upon him was annulled and set aside and the case was remanded with instructions that the trial judge sentence defendant to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence for distribution of marijuana. Defendant alleged, among other things, that the trial court erred in denying his motion in arrest of judgment on the ground that he was tried by a jury of 12 and should have been tried by a jury of five. The court agreed and reversed defendant's conviction and sentence. Pursuant to La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 41, cases in which the punishment was necessarily at hard labor were to be tried by a jury of 12, while cases in which the punishment might be at hard labor were to be tried by a jury of five. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:971(b)(2), the penalty for distribution of marijuana was a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor of not more than 10 years, a fine, or both. Because the crime charged was not one necessarily punishable at hard labor, defendant should have been tried by a five-person jury.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:661 (1968). By operating his vehicle on a public highway, defendant implicitly consented to the blood testing that was conducted when he was unconscious. Because the testing was done with probable cause and in a reasonable manner, there was no violation of the constitutional guarantees of due process and against self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">General criminal intent needed not be specifically stated. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11 provided that in the absence of qualifying provisions, the term &quot;intentional&quot; referred to general criminal intent. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 472 stated that in offenses requiring only a general criminal intent, the indictment needed not allege that the act was intentionally done. As for one bill of exception, the judge found that as a prospective juror was unable to read and write English with sufficient facility, he was excused over an objection. The question of qualifications was addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge within the bounds prescribed by law. As for another bill, a motion for mistrial was denied based on the allegation that women were improperly excluded from the general venire. However, Louisiana's provisions, requiring women to file a written declaration of their desire to be subject to jury service before they could be selected, impaired no right of the accused. As for another bill, defense counsel's objection that the punishment was cruel and unusual was overruled. The court found that the punishment imposed was within the limits of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), that convicted him of inciting a riot, which crime was a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:329.2. The trial court refused to grant the defense's oral motion for a directed verdict at the close of the State's direct case; the trial court ruled that it did not have the authority to grant a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court ruled that the law that defendant had been accused of violating, which was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:329.2, was not unconstitutional. Actions, endeavors, or conduct to procure or incite others to riot was not protected by the First Amendment. For speech to constitute inciting to riot, it had to be a willful, intentional endeavor to gain as an immediate result and specifically from that speech the participation of three or more persons in combination to do violence. The court also overruled prior case law that had been construed to declare La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 778&nbsp;unconstitutional on the basis of the La. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 9 (1921). The language of art. 778- -where the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction- -was held by the court to refer to a situation in which the prosecution had produced no evidence to prove a crime or an essential element of a crime; thus, it was permissible for the trial court to grant a directed verdict in such a case. The court found no evidence to prove that defendant had willfully incited riot.</SPAN></P>

The police arrested defendant when he came out of another apartment with drug paraphernalia in his hand. The court reversed the conviction and sentence, holding that the officers' warrantless search did not have probable cause and therefore violated defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment. Although defendant was arrested in a hallway, his arrest was not valid under the plain view doctrine because the police did not have a right to be in the hallway, which was not truly public in nature, or in the building, which was kept locked with access only to tenants and guests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury returned a bill of indictment charging defendant with murder. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 532(9), defendant moved to quash the indictment. Defendant alleged that the general venire and petit jury venire were improperly constituted by virtue of the jury service exemptions provided in La. Const. of 1921 art. VII, &sect; 41 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 402, which provided to members of the female sex an exemption from jury service unless they indicated a desire to serve. On appeal from the trial court's judgment quashing the indictment, the court reversed. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a Florida statute that was almost identical to the provisions at issue. Thus, the court concluded that the exemption provided to women under art. 402 and the La. Const. of 1921 art. VII, &sect; 41 did not violate the due process provisions of the United States Constitution because the exemption of the female class was based on a reasonable classification.</SPAN></P>

VII, &sect; 10, the carrier sought review of the judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which upheld the tax assessed by defendant Collector of Revenue for the State of Louisiana and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:462(A)(5), which created tax classifications, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 47:462(A)(5), vehicles located in urban domiciles were subject to lower tax rates than those imposed upon similar commercial vehicles. The carrier contended that &sect; 47:462(A)(5) was unconstitutional in that it fixed rate classifications for vehicles by domicile and was arbitrary and unreasonable. The trial court found that urban domicile was a reasonable basis for classification. The trial court noted that urban businesses were generally subject to a higher tax burden than other business and held that &sect; 47:462(A)(5) tended to equalize that burden. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not improperly take judicial notice of Louisiana's tax structure. The only fact that might have been noticed by the trial court was that municipally-domiciled firms faced higher property taxes; that fact was a matter of common knowledge, subject to no reasonable dispute. The legislature did not exceed its authority under La. Const. of 1921 art. VI, &sect; 22 when it incorporated concepts of domicile in the taxing statute; art. VI, &sect; 22 was primarily permissive and did not expressly limit the legislative power of taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were tried for the armed robbery of a gun shop before a 12-person jury, which reached a non-unanimous verdict of guilty. The owner shot one defendant while he handed over his wallet, which defendant dropped. One defendant was arrested in the hospital where he sought treatment, and another was arrested in the car outside. A .25 caliber pistol and shell casing found near the scene, a blood-soaked shirt found in a warrantless search of the car, and a defendant's statement were admitted into evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that both the armed robbery statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat.

The court found sufficient expert and lay testimony to provide a foundation to admit the pistol and casings.

As to the offense description it was written as prima facie speeding. There was no other description of the alleged offense written upon the Bill of Information. Defendant filed a motion to Quash the Bill of Information and this was granted by the trial court on the grounds that the Bill of Information was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The State appealed. On review, the court did not reach the question of the constitutionality of the statute. This was because the Bill of Information was insufficient under La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Twenty-Fifth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Bernard (Louisiana) convicting him of aggravated rape, La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had no right to inspect clothing worn by the victim when she was raped because the evidence was privileged and not favorable to defendant. The victim's in-court identification of defendant vitiated any pre-trial identification of defendant by other victims who alleged they were attacked by defendant. The testimony of other victims as to the circumstances of their attacks was admissible to show defendant's knowledge, consistent pattern of conduct, and intent and licentious disposition under La.

This was a matter of proof at trial. Officers were looking for the perpetrator of several rapes and kidnappings. They pursued defendant because he and his car fit descriptions linked to prior attacks. He was seen attempting to pick up two girls and fled as officers approached. Officers had probable cause under La. Const. art. I, 7, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:60 to make a warrantless arrest.

The court held that the articles of the Louisiana State Bar Association, insofar as they allowed the suspension of an attorney from the practice of law because of his conviction of a &quot;serious crime&quot; without affording him a prior hearing on the issue were in violation of the due process provisions of the United States Constitution and La.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This prosecution placed at issue the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106, the Louisiana obscenity statute. Defendant contended that &sect; 14:106(2) was unconstitutionally vague and broad in its application to sexually explicit motion picture film. The question was whether the statute met constitutional requirements. The court held that it did and stated that when the statute made the exhibition &quot;with the intent to primarily appeal to the prurient interest of the average person of any lewd, lascivious, filthy or sexually indecent film&quot; a crime, it had established a community standard and it had reprobated material whose dominant theme appealed to the prurient interest in sex. Whether the material had redeeming social value was a matter of defense. The exhibition of obscene matter might be justifiable because of its social value, and if so, it was to constitute a defense to prosecution for any crime based on that conduct. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:18.</SPAN></P>

Both the manufacturer and the model company were out of state residents unlicensed to do business in Louisiana. The parents served both companies pursuant to Louisiana's long arm statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3201. The companies argued that the provisions of the Louisiana long arm statute did not make them amenable to service. The court held that Louisiana had personal jurisdiction over both companies. Both companies regularly did business in Louisiana. The manufacturer solicited business by national advertising, which resulted in direct sales from the manufacturer to individuals in Louisiana. The model company advertised nationally and sold directly to distributors located in Louisiana. Both companies regularly did business in Louisiana, and regularly engaged in a persistent course of conduct there, and therefore were liable for injuries caused in Louisiana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer of the debtor was ordered to pay to the creditor 20 percent of the debtor's wages, but it was provided that the garnishment should not encroach upon the amount exempt by law. At the time of the judgment, La. Rev. Stat.

Acts 242 set the new exemption of earnings at 75 percent but provided that in no case should the exemption be less than $ 70 per week. After the 1970 Act became effective, the employer stopped garnishing the employee's wages. The debtor filed a motion to revive the garnishment judgment. The city court reinstated the original judgment of garnishment, and the appellate court affirmed. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment that the 1970 Act did not apply retroactively, holding that the Act was remedial legislation and its retroactive application did not violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it was addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken were reasonable and appropriate to that end.

The utility appealed. The court noted that its jurisdiction was limited to a determination of whether the projected rate of return was confiscatory and therefore unconstitutional.

The makers made no contention of unequal bargaining power or overreaching by the creditor, nor was there any evidence of abuse.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did plead not guilty by reason of insanity. He sought to admit hospital records via La. Rev. Stat.

The court agreed with the trial court's refusal to admit the records. The court concurred with the trial court's view that the hospital records were detailed and voluminous and that a condition was subject to change and that a record showing a condition at a certain time would not necessarily show that condition later. The court found that three doctors testified as to their evaluations of defendant, and they were allowed to refer to hospital records. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not allowing the records to be admitted. The court wrote that hearsay was not the issue. The court had previously ruled that &sect; 13:3714 provided an exception to the hearsay rule and that it did not violate the right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the State was not required to prove a national standard and that defendant failed to provide any evidence of a national standard. The court found that there were no reliable guides in defining community standards and that only the U.S. Supreme Court was qualified to apply constitutional standards regarding whether material taken as a whole appealed to prurient interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was killed during an armed robbery and defendant was arrested and questioned. Defendant executed a statement that he received Miranda warnings and then gave a written statement that he participated in the robbery, but his companion fired the fatal shot. Defendant testified that he was punched and kicked by the police who testified that the confession was freely and voluntarily given. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court's finding that the confession was voluntary was not clearly erroneous. Testimony as to whether lie detector tests had been given to a witness was improperly admitted, but did not constitute reversible error because defendant was not prejudiced. A mere reference of the test was made, but there was no mention of the result. The court held that the error was not so prejudicial to defendant's rights under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 921 in light of the fact that defendant voluntarily confessed and there was evidence that defendant had borrowed the gun that killed the victim. Because the death penalty was found unconstitutional, the court annulled the death sentence and remanded for the imposition of a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with abducting and murdering two gas station attendants during a robbery. On appeal, the court held that the exclusion of four anti-death penalty jurors from the panel did not prejudice defendants because the Louisiana death penalty had been declared unconstitutional.&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:432 did not destroy the presumption of innocence but merely made it rebuttable. The trial court properly instructed the jury on criminal conspiracy under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:26 because the issue of conspiracy was relevant in multiple-defendant cases. Defendants' extrajudicial confessions were carefully introduced to avoid violating the Bruton rule. The prosecutor's challenging of a defense witness's testimony with her prior inconsistent statement that the victims &quot;were just two white honkys who got killed&quot; was not grounds for a mistrial because the racial slur was not an improper remark or comment to the jury within the meaning of La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury returned ten indictments, one for perjury, and the rest for criminal defamation, against defendant, a defeated mayoral candidate. The district attorney, who had participated in the election, recused himself. The trial judge improperly received evidence as to the motions to quash, so it was error to have quashed the indictments. It was entirely proper for the district attorney to have recused himself because he might have impaired his power to conduct defendant's trial impartially. The appointment of a district attorney ad hoc, therefore, was authorized by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 682. He properly substituted bills of information to remove any doubt concerning the validity of the indictments, which were returned while the recused district attorney was serving as advisor to the Grand Jury. The filing was curative only, and did not convert the prosecutions into new and different cases. The court held that La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of abortion under &sect; 14:87. He appealed his conviction based on the trial court's denial of his constitutional objections. The court held that he did not affirmatively allege vagueness and overbreadth and denied this appeal ground. Defendant also raised the procedural question of testimony on rebuttal. At issue was the state's presentation of a woman who testified that defendant had given her an abortion. The testimony came as rebuttal and was allegedly presented to show intent. The state's and defendant's case did not include a dispute over intent, rather the defense was that defendant had only provided treatment after an abortion.

The court rejected defendant's contention that the black race was not proportionately represented in the petit jury venire. The court also rejected defendant's contention that members of the female sex were not proportionately represented due to the fact that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 402 excluded women from jury service unless they had filed a declaration of their desire to be subject to jury service. The court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the gun from evidence. There was probable cause to arrest defendant at the time he was stopped based on the police bulletin; therefore, the discovery of the gun resulted from a valid search incidental to the arrest.

The district court refused to hear testimony to determine whether proof was evident or the presumption was great, considered only the factors set out in La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court made no change in the interpretation of La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12, concerning bail.

A subpoena and a subpoena deces tecum were served on the politician that directed him to produce all tape recordings and any transcripts related any conversations he may have had with certain people. The politician did make the required appearance in front of the legislative committee. The legislative committee then filed an action for contempt against the politician. After trial the politician was held in contempt for failing to respond to the subpoena and the subpoena duces tecum. The appellate court dismissed the politician's appeal. On rehearing the court affirmed. The court held that the legislative committee's authority to punish for contempt extended to both members and nonmembers of the legislature. The court ruled that the legislature had provided for the judicial enforcement of contempt of the legislative committee.</SPAN></P>

On remand defendant alleged that the lower court erred in holding that the ordinances were constitutional. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the vital and compelling interest of the City of New Orleans justified the prohibition of certain language to a member of the city police while in the actual performance of his duties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners went before the Board of Parole (Board) and were denied parole without reasons. Reasons were requested, but were refused according to the Board's policy. Mandamus was sought to compel the chief parole officer to give reasons for the denial of parole. The prisoners contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 49:951-966 applied, arguing that the Board was an agency and required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:958 to give reasons for its actions. The court held that the applicable law governing the Board's actions was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:574.2-574.14. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:951-966 dealt generally with administrative boards and agencies. The Board was created and regulated by Title 15, Chapter 5 of the Revised Statutes. From reading that Title, the Board was not the usual administrative agency. A comparison of the law on parole with the law on administrative procedure made it clear that the Board was not the sort of agency or board contemplated as subject to the law on general administrative procedure. Under Title 15, the Board was not required to give a reason for the denial of parole.</SPAN></P>

Both plaintiff firefighters and defendant city sought review of the judgment that reversed a contempt judgment against the city as to one aspect of compensation and remanded certain other aspects for the trial court to set a reasonable time within the city had to comply or face contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal stemmed from lengthy litigation between the firefighters and the city regarding certain compensation issues. The firefighters prevailed on the merits with respect to most issues, but brought contempt cases when the city appeared to be out of compliance with the judgments. The court below did not find that the city was in contempt with respect to most issues. In the longevity and minimum salary cases, however, the court below held that the city's failure to comply with the court's prior judgment did not constitute wilful disobedience and remanded the cases for the trial court to set a reasonable time within which to comply, or face contempt proceedings. Both sides applied for review of this judgment and raised numerous arguments. For example, the city argued that the underlying statutes regarding compensation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:1992 and 1996, were unconstitutional. However, the court held that the city was barred by res judicata from defending on the basis of the unconstitutionality of the legislative acts involved.Likewise, the court held that the city could not, in this contempt action which sought to enforce a final judgment, plead prescription.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments below with respect to whether the city was in contempt regarding various compensation issues affecting the firefighters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which overruled defendant's exception to the trial court's instruction to a prospective juror that, since capital punishment could no longer be imposed in Louisiana, only nine of the 12 jurors needed to concur to reach a verdict, and that the jury would not be sequestered during the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that, in light of the United States Supreme Court's (Court) decision holding the death penalty to be unconstitutional where the jury has the discretion to impose the death sentence or a lesser sentence, only the imposition and execution of a capital sentence was reprobated, leaving intact the crimes and the procedural devices applicable to cases in which the death penalty was applicable before the Court's decision. The state contended that since there were no more capital cases, and since the only punishment available for the crime of murder was life imprisonment, the constitutional and statutory provisions requiring nine out of 12 jury verdict, and no sequestration applicable to non-capital felony cases had to apply to what were formerly capital cases. The court held that La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 41 referred to classes of crimes, and those that the legislature classified as capital offenses had be tried by a jury of 12, all of whom must concur to render a verdict. The court further held that murder was still classified as a &quot;capital case,&quot; and that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 791 required the sequestration of the jury in capital cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold marijuana to an undercover agent and was sentenced to five years in the penitentiary for distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence obtained illegally as a result of entrapment. The court held that defendant did not allege that he was aggrieved by an unconstitutional search and was not entitled to a determination of the entrapment issue in advance of trial. The court held that the trial court correctly sustained an objection to an irrelevant question about the agent's personal feelings about marijuana use and denied a new trial because the crime was committed in the parish. The court upheld the denial of a motion in arrest of judgment because the body of the act contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:971, under which defendant was charged, did not exceed the scope of its title and was constitutional in that marijuana was defined as a narcotic at the time of its enactment. The court held that the evidence of defendant's distribution of LSD under circumstances similar to the charge was admissible to prove guilty knowledge, intent, and system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the State rested its case, defendant moved to suppress evidence based upon the alleged lack of probable cause for an arrest based on the alleged failure of the arresting officer to testify as to the circumstances which furnished probable cause. Defendant thus contended that all objects seized as a result of the allegedly illegal arrest should have been suppressed. However, no attack was made upon the legality of the arrest before trial or during the presentation of the State's case. The only objection was based upon the lack of proof of a chain of custody, which the trial court correctly overruled. Because the legality of the arrest and the search and seizure incident thereto were not questioned, the State simply proved the arrest, without objection, as evidence that the physical objects were taken from defendant's person which connected him with the earlier murder. In the absence of contest as to the lawfulness of the arrest, the State was under no obligation to introduce irrelevant and possibly prejudicial evidence as to the circumstances thereof. The court therefore found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's belated motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which denied his motion for credit for time served in the parish prison between his conviction and the passing of sentence, and between the passing of sentence and the final disposition of his case on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction for possessing heroin, defendant was sentenced to serve seven and one-half years in the penitentiary. Between conviction and sentencing he served 58 days in the parish jail, and between his sentencing and the disposition of his appeal he served another 389 days in the jail, at which point he began serving his sentence. The trial court denied defendant's motion for credit for the time spent in the parish jail. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 880 (1966), which was in effect when defendant was sentenced, gave the sentencing judge discretion whether to give a defendant credit for time served prior to the imposition of sentence, and the subsequent amendment to art. 880, which made credit mandatory, did not apply retroactively. Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to credit for the 58 days served prior to sentencing. However, judicial precedents established that, to avoid inhibiting criminal defendants from exercising their rights of appeal, those defendants were entitled to credit for time served while appeals of their convictions were pending. Accordingly, the court ordered that defendant be given credit for time served while his appeal was pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insofar as the order refused to give defendant credit for time served in the parish prison between his conviction and the passing of sentence it was affirmed. Insofar as it denied him credit for time served between the passing of sentence and the final disposition of his case on appeal it was reversed and the court ordered that defendant be given credit on his sentence for the time so served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Board of Supervisors of the Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, appealed a declaratory judgment from the court of appeal (Louisiana) in favor of plaintiff, the Student Government Association (SGA) of the university's Baton Rouge campus, holding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:803 was binding upon the Board and prohibiting the Board from imposing parking fines of more than one dollar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SGA sought a declaratory judgment that &sect; 17:803, providing for a maximum fine of one dollar for the violation of any parking regulation on the campus of a state supported college or university, be recognized as applying to the university and therefore, overriding a university regulation providing for a parking fine of five dollars. The lower courts held that &sect; 17:1803 did not infringe upon the Board's constitutional authority to administer the university. On appeal, the court reversed and held that La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7 unambiguously granted to the Board full administrative control over the university. The power to regulate student parking and to enforce reasonable parking regulations by administrative penalties, including fines, was clearly within the grant to the Board of exclusive administrative authority over students in their relationship with the university and in their use of the university campus. Section 17:803 was a legislative infringement on the Board's exclusive administrative power over university affairs and was therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, dismissed the action, and rejected the SGA's demand that it declare the university parking regulations invalid insofar as they imposed a fine exceeding the maximum permitted by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance known as Tuinol under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:971. Before defendant was sentenced, however, the Supreme Court of Louisiana declared unconstitutional the act that regulated certain drugs, including Tuinol. Defense counsel filed a motion in arrest of judgment, which was granted by the district court. A second information was thereafter filed charging defendant with possession of barbiturates under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1033 and stemming from the same incident. Defense counsel moved to quash, and the district court granted the motion, finding that trial on this charge would amount to double jeopardy. The State applied for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. In reversing the district court's judgment and remanding the case for trial, the court concluded that the repeal of &sect; 40:971 did not have the effect of releasing defendant from criminal liability in the absence of express language in the repealing decision. As such, the law remained in force for the purpose of sustaining defendant's conviction and for the enforcement of a penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court order granting the motion to quash was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(A)(2). The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress on the basis that the seizure of the films without a prior adversary hearing violated the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The court reversed, holding that the seizure complied with the Fourth Amendment and that no adversary hearing was required for the seizure of a single copy of an allegedly obscene motion picture under a valid search warrant, which was based upon an affidavit with factual statements for a determination of probable cause. The court held that the only lawful means for producing the evidence for an obscenity offense was to seize the film unless the material was readily available for purchase and that to insure protection of First Amendment rights, an immediate hearing within 48 hours was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Louisiana and a Parish challenged an order of the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which reversed a trial court and recalled its injunction that restrained and enjoined defendant theatre owners and operators from exhibiting an obscene motion picture in the Parish. The appellate court declared unconstitutional&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4712 of the Abatement of Public Nuisances Act, &sect;&sect; 13:4711-17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 13:4712 provided that an obscene motion picture, as defined by the criminal laws of Louisiana, and premises displaying it were nuisances to be enjoined. The principal attack upon the constitutionality of &sect; 13:4712 was aimed at its declaration that the judge &quot;shall&quot; grant a temporary injunction. The court found that &sect; 13:4712 did not require that the judge sign every petition. Rather, the judge was to ascertain whether the petition and affidavit alleged that a film was being exhibited with intent to primarily appeal to the prurient interest of the average person, and that it was lewd, lascivious, filthy, or sexually indecent. The court held that &sect; 13:4712 set out a reasonable basis for restraint, providing for an adversary hearing within five days of the issuance of a temporary injunction. Further, in the court's view, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3606 required a decision on a preliminary injunction at the earliest possible time; the appellate procedure, arts. 3601, 2081-2167, was as expeditious as possible. Finally, the trial court correctly applied the statute, placing the burden on the State and the Parish, and the court agreed with its holding that the film was obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and reinstated the judgment of the trial court, making it the judgment of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being sentenced to death for murder, defendant appealed on the basis that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the constitution. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Specifically, the court held that defendant's death sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment because the cruelty against which La. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 protected a convicted man from was cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely. Furthermore, the court found that certain statements made by the prosecutor during opening statements were not inculpatory statements, rather, the statements were part of the res gestae and were admissible under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:447 because defendant made the statements to co-defendant almost immediately after murdering the victims in an effort to conceal the victims' bodies.</SPAN></P>
