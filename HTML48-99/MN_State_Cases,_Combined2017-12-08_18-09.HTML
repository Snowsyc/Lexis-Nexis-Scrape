Stat. &sect; 176.081 (1998). The relators asserted that the 1995 amendments to section 176.081, which limited the availability and amounts of attorney fees, violated the Separation of Powers and Due Process Clauses of Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, and art. I, &sect; 7. The relators further asserted that the provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.081 allowing for an award of attorney fees based on &quot;the dollar value of the medical benefit awarded&quot; should be interpreted to mean the dollar amount billed by the provider of the medical benefit, rather than the fee schedule amount awarded. The court reversed the part of the decision concerning Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.081, subd. 7 (1998) holding that under the plain language of the statute, a subdivision 7 award should be based on all attorney fees paid pursuant to Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the intermediate court of appeals (Minnesota), affirming and modifying a trial court order awarding to the victim of appellant's assault restitution pursuant to Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 611A.04(1)(a). Appellant sought review only for those funds awarded for the conduct of a ceremony involving the sacrifice of animals to heal the soul of the victim according to his native tribal beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order affirming, but modifying downward, an award of restitution to the victim of appellant's criminal assault. The appeal concerned only those funds awarded for the victim to conduct a ceremony indigenous to his native tribe in Laos that included the sacrifice of small animals to heal his soul as the result of his physical injuries. The court affirmed the award of restitution, as modified, finding that Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 611A.04(1)(a), provided great latitude to the trial court to determine restitution, including any out-of-pocket losses resulting from the crime. The court found that the broad language of the statute clearly and unambiguously left such decisions to the trial court, subject to review for abuse of discretion. The court found no abuse of abuse of discretion based on the evidence. The court also found that appellant failed to establish that the subject ceremony was religious, as opposed to a tradition, thus failing to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the statute as a violation of U.S. Const., amend. I., and the Establishment Clause of the Minnesota Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, paternal grandparents and their adopted children, argued that the award of visitation to respondents, maternal grandparents, was an abuse of discretion that required reversal. The court agreed, and reversed the award of visitation to the maternal grandparents. The court found that the trial court did not follow the statutory mandate to weigh heavily the lack of contact between respondents and their grandchildren prior to their application for visitation. The court also found an absence of findings of fact with regard to the adopted children's preferences regarding their willingness to visit with respondents. The court stated that the grandparent visitation statute clearly required that visitation be in the children's best interests. The court concluded that given the trial court's lack of findings in support of its conclusion and the significant amount of time during which the children had no relationship with respondents, the trial court abused its discretion in ordering visitation for respondents.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 253B.02(18c). Appellant argued on appeal that the SDP Act was unconstitutional on substantive and procedural due process grounds. He also argued that the SDP Act violated the ban on double jeopardy and ex post facto laws. The court found that the SDP Act did not violate the ban on double jeopardy or ex post facto laws because it used prior criminal convictions for evidentiary purposes only and did not therefore involve retribution. Furthermore, it did not implicate deterrence because persons committed under it were by definition, suffering from a mental abnormality that prevented them from exercising adequate control over their behavior. The SDP Act was found to not violate substantive due process because the state had a compelling interest in both protecting the public from sexual violence and rehabilitating the mentally ill, and because the SDP Act was found to be narrowly tailored to meet those interests. Because the evidence supported the conclusion that appellant lacked adequate control over his sexual behavior, his commitment under the SDP Act was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of assault in a sexually oriented crime and was incarcerated. Upon his release, he was required to register as a sex offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. 1(a) (1998). Appellant did not agree with the requirement and sought administrative and judicial review. On appeal, he argued that requiring him to register despite the fact that he was not convicted of a &quot;sex offense&quot; was unreasonable, that it violated his right to substantive due process, and that it violated his right to procedural due process. On review, the court found that appellant met the statutory language and that he was in fact required to register. The court determined that the statute was constitutional and that appellant's due process claims were without merit because he was not deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law in any actionable way. The court concluded that, because appellant was charged with an enumerated predatory offense and was convicted of another offense which arose out of the same set of circumstances as the charged predatory offense, he was properly required to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 609.02(6). On the third attempt, the lower court correctly instructed the jury and the jury convicted defendant. On review, the conviction was affirmed and defendant appealed. On appeal to this court, the court held that it was not beyond a reasonable doubt that the errors in the jury instructions did not contribute to defendant's convictions, as the jury verdict was based almost exclusively on whether the liquor bottles used in the altercation were dangerous weapons and likely to produce great bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state commissioner of corrections appealed decision of the Court of Appeals (Minnesota), which granted petitioning prisoner's writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner had sought relief from an additional period of confinement added to his minimum sentence, which delayed early release, for petitioner's failure to participate in and complete a sex offender treatment program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner was convicted of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor. Treatment for such prisoners was mandated by state law, but petitioner was terminated from the program on the ground that he was not amendable to treatment because he refused to admit his guilt. Petitioner's refusal to admit guilt was based on part on his assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the fact that his appeal was still pending. The commissioner of corrections added 90 days to petitioner's minimum confinement time as a sanction. The lower appellate court held that this violated petitioner's rights under the Fifth Amendment and granted his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The state appealed and the court reversed. The court focused on the nature of the claimed compulsion and concluded that the choice between treatment and confinement for a larger portion of his sentence did not rise to the level of compulsion constituting a Fifth Amendment violation. Petitioner did not have a fundamental right to refuse treatment and did not have a fundamental right to an early release date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision below and denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court concluded that requiring petitioner to choose between early release and refusing treatment by failing to admit the crime was not a violation of the Fifth Amendment because petitioner did not have a fundamental right to early release or a fundamental right to refuse treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner and others staged an anti-fur protest outside a department store in a mall. Several of the protesters were eventually peacefully arrested and charged with misdemeanor trespass. They moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the protest was protected by the state constitution's free speech guarantee, which, they urged, should be construed more broadly than U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court agreed. The court of appeals reversed, declining to extend state constitutional protection to petitioners' speech based on the patent lack of support for the trial court's conclusion that the framers of the Minnesota Constitution intended the state's free speech provision to provide more protection than its federal counterpart. The court affirmed. Neither the invitation to the public to shop and be entertained at the mall nor the public financing used to develop the property constituted state action. The differences in terminology between the federal constitutional free speech protection and its Minnesota counterpart did not support a conclusion that the state protection should be more broadly applied than the federal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Minnesota Constitution did not offer greater protection to speech than the federal Constitution, nor did public access to a mall or public financing transform the nature of its property from private to public for purposes of free speech protection under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with crimes including enhanced aggravated driving while intoxicated (DWI) under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.129(1) and enhanced gross misdemeanor DWI under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121(1)(f). Appellant contended that the statutes' two-year sentencing provisions were unconstitutional and sought pretrial discretionary review in the court of appeals (Minnesota). The court of appeals denied review, but the instant court granted expedited review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the enhanced gross misdemeanor driving while intoxicated statute's two-year sentencing provisions, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121(3)(d), and Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.129(2)(b), and the amended definition of felony, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.02(2), were unconstitutional because they permitted local imprisonment for a period exceeding one year without a 12-person jury. The instant court stated that the legislature was free to ascribe a two-year sentence to the criminal conduct at issue, so long as the legislature recognized that in so doing it had created a felony. The legislature could not create a class of crimes whose severity mandated a sentence of greater than one year's incarceration and then call those crimes misdemeanors so as to deny defendants their constitutional right to a 12-person jury. Thus, the court declared unconstitutional the enhanced gross misdemeanor sentencing statutes, as well as the statute amending the definition of felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent prosecutor's office was prohibited from blanket exercise of the judge removal rule, Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.03(13)(4), where extensive use of the rule was abusive and limited judicial independence. Appellant criminal defendants were charged with gross misdemeanor driving while intoxicated and with driving after suspension or revocation of a driver's license. Respondent removed the assigned judge as of right under the criminal procedure rules. Appellants brought a motion objecting to the removal. The trial court's chief judge denied the motion. Appellants sought review. The appellate court denied appellant's petition for discretionary review. Appellants again sought review. The reviewing court reversed and remanded, holding that where extensive blanket removal limited judicial independence and respondent used the removal rule to achieve its own goals on virtually all criminal cases in the county, its use was abusive. The reviewing court subjected respondent's further use of the removal rule to a showing of cause and suspended its use for six months.

Defendant argued that various costs awarded to the state were not recoverable. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed defendant's conviction and the imposition of prosecution costs. Defendant sought review. The state supreme court granted review on the issue of prosecution costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree intentional murder, and the trial court imposed certain costs of prosecution upon defendant. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant appealed further and certiorari was granted on the prosecution costs issue. On appeal, the state reduced its request for prosecution costs because certain costs arising out of an earlier mistrial should not have been awarded. Finding the plain language of the prosecution costs statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 631.48 (1996), did not require an inquiry into defendant's ability to pay, the court next addressed whether the specific costs claimed by the state were recoverable under the statute. The statute expressly allowed for the recovery of extradition and exhibit costs, and &sect; 357.25 gave the trial court discretion to award costs for the toxicologist's travel. The civil disbursements statute,&nbsp;&sect; 549.04, allowed the state to recover its costs for subpoenas or service of process. On the other hand, &sect; 631.48 did not allow recovery for translator and interpreter costs or grand jury costs, nor could expenses incurred by medical examiners be imposed against defendant. Further, &sect; 631.48 was silent regarding witness travel fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After granting review on the issue of prosecution costs imposed upon defendant following his conviction for second degree intentional murder, the court held that the prosecution costs statute did not require the trial court to assess defendant's ability to pay before awarding such costs to the state.

The court affirmed, holding that relator was a nondomiciliary resident because she was present in Minnesota for more than half of 1990. The ten &quot;business&quot; days that relator spent in Minnesota were counted because the transit rule did not apply where relator was not traveling through Minnesota on her way to another destination. Relator's due process rights were protected because the nondomiciliary resident statute was based on a minimum connection between relator and Minnesota, and the imposition of the tax represented a rational relationship between relator's income and the benefits she received from Minnesota. Because interstate commerce was not substantially affected by requiring relator to pay tax on worldwide income based on conduct that took place wholly within Minnesota, the nondomiciliary resident statute did not even implicate the &quot;dormant&quot; commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

Relator's constitutional challenges to the nondomiciliary resident statute on due process and commerce clause grounds lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city constructed a trunk water main and assessed the property owners with a portion of the costs. The property owners successfully challenged the assessment, and a trial court reduced it. Four years later when the property owners wished to connect to city water, the city charged them a standard connection fee, plus a lateral benefit water fee in the amount of the difference between the original assessment and the judicially reduced assessment. The property owners brought suit challenging the fee, and the trial court entered judgment in favor of the city. Upon review the appellate court upheld the decision, and upon further review, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the recoupment constituted an unconstitutional taking and a subversion of the judicial reduction of the assessment. The court held that the lateral benefit fee was imposed discriminatorily as a way to subvert the order made in the first challenge, and was not just and equitable. The court held that the fee was impermissible regardless of whether it was an assessment or a connection charge, and thus the property owners were entitled to a refund of the fee they paid under protest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: 1) the district court's initial order was appealable pursuant to Minn. R. Civ.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 270.91-98 was constitutional and respondent county was justified in classifying the taxpayers with respect to assessing a contamination tax in order to recapture property taxes lost when the assessed value of the land was reduced due to contamination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator taxpayers owed two parcels of property housing a manufacturing company, which remanufactured auto parts. As a result of the operation of the company, the property was contaminated. Respondent county imposed a contamination tax upon relators pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 270.91-98. Relators challenged the imposition of said tax and the tax court upheld the constitutionality of the assessment. Relators sought review of the tax court's decision and contended the assessment was unconstitutional and improperly classified the taxpayers. The court upheld the tax court's judgment. The court held that a legitimate basis existed for establishing a separate classification of taxable property with respect to contaminated property. The court reasoned such distinctions are not arbitrary in nature. Secondly, the court held the classification scheme was reasonably related to the purpose of the underlying statute. Thirdly, the court held the purpose of the contamination tax was one in which respondent could legitimately attempt to achieve. Lastly, the court held the imposition of the contamination tax in excess of the value of the relators' property did not constitute a governmental taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the tax court's judgment finding the contamination tax constitutional. The court held that the tax statute did not unreasonably attempt to classify relator taxpayers, was reasonably related to the purpose of the contamination tax statute, and was a statute in which respondent county could reasonably expect to impose and achieve the goal thereof. Moreover, the court held a government taking did not occur.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that evidence of defendant's prior incidents of domestic abuse against the victim were admissible because evidence of other criminal acts that was directly probative of his past pattern of domestic abuse, which was an element of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185, subd. 6, was not &quot;other crimes&quot; evidence for purposes of Minn. R. Evid. 404(b). Because admissibility of the evidence was not governed by Rule 404(b), the trial court did not have to scrutinize it to determine whether the prior misconduct could have been established by clear and convincing evidence. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury that each incident offered to prove the &quot;past pattern of domestic abuse&quot; had to itself be proven beyond a reasonable doubt was not plain error. The underlying prior acts were not individual elements of the crime, and the statute did not require proof of a pattern of domestic abuse convictions.

The court held that the sentence did not offend evolving standards of decency nor was it generally abhorrent to the community. Therefore, it was not cruel under the Minnesota Constitution.

The taxpayer was in the business of offering a variety of financial services to its customers and was not in the practice of buying, selling, or developing real estate.

Because the state had a compelling interest in protecting the privacy interests of the victim, the court approved of in camera review, although the journals were not statutorily privileged; and 3.) The trial court error in denying discovery of the journals and limiting cross-examination regarding them was clearly prejudicial, because their exclusion could well have contributed to the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, en banc, affirmed the lower appellate court's decision that the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to allow respondent to cross-examine the victim regarding the contents of personal journals and agreed that the respondent was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony harassment in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749, subd. 2(7). The court of appeals refused to dismiss the charges based on defendant's overbreadth and vagueness challenge. The court reversed and dismissed the charges, concluding that the statute was overbroad on its face and as applied. The harassing conduct proscribed by the statute encompassed expressive activity because it criminalized any intentional conduct that caused a reasonable person to feel oppressed, persecuted, or intimidated, if that conduct interfered with the person's privacy or liberty. It was not possible to construe the statute narrowly as applying only to fighting words because the statute's language swept in a whole spectrum of constitutionally protected activity, including defendant's actions of riding his horse through the crowd of gay protesters, combined with his statements disparaging homosexuals. Defendant's actions and statements were inseparable because he would not have been charged under the statute for simply riding his horse through the crowd. The statements did not constitute fighting words because they were not likely to incite an immediate breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To insure a steady stream of solid waste for their waste treatment plant, the municipality created a tax and subsidy scheme to support their sanitary district.

The appeals court affirmed that decision. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the tax and subsidy arrangement did not impose any differential burden on out-of-state commerce, did not have a discriminatory purpose, and therefore did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The court held that it imposed only a minor incidental burden on interstate commerce which was far outweighed by the benefits to the municipality, and was therefore lawful.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 273.111. Relators filed an action in the Tax Court (Minnesota) alleging that their equal protection rights were denied because the county failed to send them statutorily required annual notices of the property's taxable market value. The court held that the assessment was valid. Relators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that relators should have received the statutorily required notice under Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.121 (1996). However, the court held that their failure to receive the notice did not invalidate the assessment of estimated market value or the amount of payback taxes due because the statute requiring notice specified that lack of notice had no effect on the tax or the assessment upon which it is based. The court also noted that relator did not show that they suffered substantial prejudice by the lack of notice. The court held that if notice was not provided to Green Acres property owners, it would be proper for the trial court, or reviewing administrative board, to determine whether the assessment of estimated market value was excessive at the time the property no longer qualified for Green Acres tax treatment. In the case at bar, the court held that relators' property was properly assessed pursuant to &sect; 273.111, subd. 9 for purposes of levying payback taxes. The court held that relators were not deprived of their right to due process by the lack of notice, nor were they deprived of their right to equal protection and uniformity in taxation by the assessment of payback taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the corporate excise taxation system was unconstitutional on its face because it discriminated against foreign commerce. For purposes of calculating taxes, a corporation that operated as a unitary business was required to include its foreign members' interest and royalty payments as income without taking the foreign members' property, payroll, and sales into consideration. The court held that the corporate excise tax statute did not facially discriminate against foreign commerce. The corporation failed to meet its burden of demonstrating an undue burden on foreign commerce. The only foreign commerce subject to taxation was interest and royalties paid to the domestic members from the foreign subsidiaries. The state did not tax the foreign members' entire income, but treated those members as separate entities engaging in arm's length transactions with the rest of the unitary group. The taxation system was an effort to avoid taxation by both the United States and a foreign country on the foreign members.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner argued that the corporation used the equipment to provide a mailing service for those customers who paid to have their mail presorted. The court held that: (1) the tax court properly denied the refund claim for the bar code sorter because the corporation did not use it to manufacture or fabricate tangible personal property for sale at retail; (2) the tax court improperly denied a refund on the character readers because the devices were capital equipment; and (3) although the corporation did not sell mail at retail, it used the character readers to manufacture bar codes, which were tangible personal property sold at retail to the USPS.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed error when the district court denied defendant's petition without an evidentiary hearing, holding that an anonymous letter defendant claimed to have received was not reliable and was unlikely to produce a more favorable result. On defendant's appeal, the court held that the district court properly denied post-conviction relief. An evidentiary hearing was not required because defendant failed to allege facts that would entitle him to the requested relief, and the letter was not a sufficient basis on which to grant a new trial. The letter constituted inadmissible hearsay and failed to address expert testimony that the shotgun's hammer and trigger would have had to have snagged on defendant's clothes simultaneously for the gun to have accidentally fired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 16-year-old, was charged in a delinquency petition with 5 criminal counts, including first degree murder. Defendant was certified as an adult under Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.015, thus, terminating all proceedings in juvenile court arising out of the same behavioral incident. After trial, a jury acquitted defendant of first degree murder, first degree felony murder, second degree murder, aggravated robbery and second degree felony murder, but convicted defendant of other charges. Defendant filed a motion to return the case to juvenile court for sentencing, which motion a trial court denied. Defendant was sentenced, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the motion and the sentencing order. On review, the court affirmed in part the denial of defendant's motion to return defendant to juvenile court because the trial court was granted original and exclusive jurisdiction in a criminal proceeding concerning a child excluded from the definition of delinquent child. The court reversed in part the portion of the sentencing order based upon the shotgun conviction because the shotgun charge was not based on the same behavioral incident as the first degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the attorney was guilty of professional misconduct under Minn. Prof. R. Conduct 8.4(d) and sanctioned him through a public reprimand and temporary suspension. In its decision, the court held that the attorney's failure to pay the legal judgment had not constituted dishonesty under Minn. R.

Although the attorney argued that his good faith belief that he was not under any valid obligation to make the payments allowed him to refuse payment, the court noted that he had admitted that at least part of his financial obligations were valid. Further, the court rejected the argument that the language of Minn. Prof. R. Conduct 8.4(d) was unconstitutionally broad.

The court did not determine whether the charge was authorized as an impact fee where there was insufficient evidence that the charge was proportionate to the need created by the development upon which the burden of payment fell.

The driver alleged that the truck was not &quot;crashworthy&quot; because of the defective seat belt restraint system and sought recovery under theories of strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty. The court agreed with a previous decision, which held that the language of the statute was unambiguous in prohibiting the admission of evidence of the use or non-use of seat belts in any litigation involving personal injury that resulted from the use or operation of a motor vehicle. The court held that in view of the many advances in automobile safety over the past 30 years and the enactment of laws mandating the use of both child restraint systems and seat belts, it was appropriate for the legislature to review the continuing desirability of the seat belt gag rule. The court held that the driver's claim failed for his failure to establish beyond a reasonable doubt either that any substantive right was implicated in his claim or that his individual interests outweighed the legislative concerns addressed by even-handed application of the seat belt law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was diagnosed as having antisocial personality disorder (APD), continued to masturbate after playing with his stepdaughter, was untruthful about sexual matters, and lacked remorse for past harmful sexual conduct. The court held that the act did not violate any of defendant's constitutional rights and that the evidence in support of his civil commitment was correctly evaluated. The act satisfied the demands of substantive due process because it was sufficiently narrow as applied to a person suffering from APD to satisfy strict scrutiny. The act's distinction between sexually dangerous persons with and without mental disorders did not violate equal protection because the classification was based on a reasonable connection between the mental disorder and the state's interests in public protection and treatment. The act was facially civil and not so punitive in purpose or effect as to trigger the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws or double jeopardy. Defendant's APD, his past record, and his current behavior supported the finding that he was likely to sexually harm others in the future and provided a sufficient evidentiary basis for his civil commitment.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, he argued that the newspaper's action in erroneously printing the photograph was a violation of the Fair Campaign Practices Act's prohibition against undue influence, as provided in Minn.

The court held that third-party violations of the election laws could not provide a basis for contesting an election. Further, the Act's forfeiture provisions applied only to election contests based on a successful candidate's violation of that Act.

The court rejected the State's contention that the search was valid because police had probable cause to believe that defendant possessed the items described in the warrant. The court found that there was an insufficient nexus between defendant and the suspected criminal activity to constitute probable cause. The court found that the search was not valid as incident to defendant's lawful arrest, noting that defendant's status as daughter of the homeowner was not a sufficient basis for her lawful arrest.

By letter dated February 20, 1996, the judge submitted his resignation to the governor, announcing his intention to retire on August 31, 1996. On February 22, 1996, the governor issued an order directing the retirement date and filed the order with the secretary. By notice of appointment, the governor appointed another judge as successor judge in the district. The secretary indicated that she did not intend to designate the office on the ballot in 1996. The individual sought an order to declare that the appointment of a successor was invalid and to direct the secretary to place on the next ballot the judge's seat. The court denied the petition, by holding that the governor was within his authority in appointing a successor judge on the retirement of the judge because such retirement created a &quot;vacancy&quot; within the meaning of Minn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 8, and the appointed person was to serve until a successor was elected and qualified after a subsequent election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner utility company sought review of a decision of a court of appeals (Minnesota ),which affirmed a decision of a public utility commission (PUC) that authorized it, in accordance with its ratemaking powers under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 216B.03, 216B.48, to impute revenue from the utility company's affiliate to the utility company and to allocate costs associated with repairing gas lines to either the utility company or its affiliate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company, a supplier of natural gas, had an affiliate that sold and repaired gas-fueled appliances. The PUC issued an order that allowed it to impute revenue to the utility company for the value of the goodwill used by the affiliate and to require that the utility company allocate costs associated with responding to gas leaks to both the utility company and its affiliate. The appellate court affirmed that order. The court reversed the appellate court's decision. First, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 216B.03, 216B.48 did not expressly allow the PUC to impute revenue to the utility company for the value of the goodwill passed, without compensation, from the utility company to its affiliate because such was not a cost of rendering utility service. Moreover, no such authorization was fairly evident from the power granted by the legislature to the PUC. Second, the PUC did not have the authority to allocate the gas leak repair costs to both the utility company and its affiliate. Because Minn. Stat. &sect; 216B.16, subd. 11 required the utility company to respond to all gas leaks, the costs of doing so were to be allocated to the utility company, even if the affiliate performed the repairs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's decision that affirmed a decision from the PUC was reversed. The PUC was not expressly or implicitly authorized to impute a goodwill value to the utility company because such was not a &quot;cost&quot; of providing utility services. Because the utility company was required by state and federal laws to repair gas leaks, it was entitled to have all gas leak repair costs allocated to it, rather than to the affiliate.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 147.01, subd. 6 (1992), which required payment of a license surcharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctors obtained or renewed their licenses to practice medicine around the same time the legislature enacted &sect; 147.01, which required the doctors to pay a license surcharge by the end of the year. The doctors filed a class action lawsuit challenging the application of &sect; 147.01 as retroactive. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and the court of appeals affirmed. The doctors appealed, and the court affirmed, though on different reasoning than the court of appeals. Generally, a statute was presumed to operate only prospectively unless the legislature clearly proscribed retroactive application. The court of appeals reasoned that the legislature's later clarification of the operation of &sect; 147.01 permitted retroactive application. However, this was incorrect. Rather, the legislature enacted &sect; 147.01 in response, albeit unstated, to earlier changed in federal law governing state eligibility for federal funding of a portion of Medicaid. As such, retroactive application was appropriate because it served a benign and legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced him to an eight-year sentence, plus 450 months probation to be served out-of-state. On appeal, the court interpreted &sect; 608.713(1), and held that physical acts, which communicated a threat that future violence was to follow, as well as oral and written threats, were included within &sect; 608.713(1). The court held that defendant's acts clearly involved threats to commit future violence, thus, his conduct constituted terroristic threats. The court further determined that the trial court properly increased defendant's sentence beyond the presumptive sentence because aggravating circumstances existed, based defendant's conduct, which took place over ten years and involved multiple victims. The court declined to consider whether the requirement that defendant serve an out-of-state probation term constituted banishment because the issue was not ripe.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 290.02, 290.092 (1987). The corporations claimed that the franchise tax violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and the Uniformity Clause of the Minnesota Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three corporations raised state and federal constitutional challenges to the AMT, a unique corporate franchise taxation scheme that was in effect in Minnesota only between 1987 and 1989. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the AMT, which levied a tax that was based on corporate sales, in-state property, and payroll within the state. Upon a successful petition by the State for accelerated review of the trial court's findings, the corporations renewed their constitutional objections. After applying the three-factor rational basis test for determining the constitutionality of statutory classifications, the court held that the corporations had failed to establish that the AMT discriminated against interstate commerce or that it violated the Uniformity and Equal Protection Clauses. The court affirmed the decision upholding the constitutionality of the AMT because the fact that the AMT considered a corporation's Minnesota sales, property, and payroll in calculating the franchise tax owed did not mean that the legislature levied an additional sales, property, and income tax on only certain corporations or that the AMT had violated the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

The state officials and Board moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The public defender moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion, finding the statute unconstitutional because it infringed upon the public defender's constitutional duty to provide criminal defense services to the poor by establishing an arbitrary and inflexible cap on state spending for such services. In reversing on appeal, the court held that: (1) as the evidence established that the public defender's office was well-respected by trial judges, was well-funded when compared to other public defender offices, and its attorneys faced no claims of professional misconduct or malpractice, the public defender failed to show an injury in fact to support his claim; and (2) the public defender's claims were too speculative and hypothetical to support jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a petition for accelerated review, defendants, state commissioner of human services and county commissioners (State), challenged the grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs, class of women of the state (women), by the District Court of Hennepin County (Minnesota). The state argued that Minnesota laws on abortion funding did not violate the women's fundamental right to privacy under Minn. Const. art I, &sect;&sect; 2,7,10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 256B.0625, subd. 16, 256B.40, 393.07, subd. 11, 261.28, Minn. R. 9505.0220(q), and Minn. R. 9505.0235(2) (challenged laws), Minnesota restricted the use of public medical assistance and general assistance funds for therapeutic abortion services. The women filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the State. The district court held that the challenged laws violated the Minnesota Constitution and it permanently enjoined them. The State appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the right of privacy under the Minnesota Constitution encompassed a woman's right to decide to terminate her pregnancy. This right was greater than that afforded under the federal constitution. Therefore, even though the federal Medicaid program under the Social Security Act permitted such restrictions, they were impermissible in Minnesota. An indigent woman's decision on whether to terminate her pregnancy was significantly impacted by the State's offer in the challenged laws of medical services if the woman carried the pregnancy to term. This placed an improper impact on the woman's decision. This improper impact violated the woman's fundamental right of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's ruling that the State's statutes which restricted the women's use of public medical assistance and general assistance funds for therapeutic abortion services violated the Minnesota Constitution. The statutes constituted an infringement on the women's fundamental right of privacy.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that defendant was not entitled to have the jury instructed, under Minn. Jury Instructions - Crim. No. 11.05, that for the jury to find him guilty of first-degree murder, it had to find that he did not act in the heat of passion. The jury was instructed, under Minn. Jury Instructions - Crim. No. 1104, that it could convict him of manslaughter in the first degree if it found that he acted in the heat of passion. The burden of proving heat of passion was not placed on defendant, as the jury was sufficiently instructed that the State had the burden of proving his guilt. Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(6) (1994) provided that a defendant was guilty of first-degree murder if he caused the death of a victim while committing domestic abuse when that person had engaged in a past pattern of domestic abuse upon the victim. The term &quot;pattern&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, and the evidence was sufficient to establish that pattern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed directly from the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota) his convictions for first-degree domestic abuse murder in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(6) (1994) and second-degree intentional murder in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.19(1) (1994), a lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that, during the history of their relationship, the victim and defendant had engaged in a number of physical altercations that often resulted in the victim being injured. Defendant claimed that the domestic abuse murder statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.185(6) (1994), was void for vagueness because it did not define the term &quot;pattern&quot; in the phrase &quot;past pattern of domestic abuse.&quot; The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Section 609.185(6) was not vague because it contained an &quot;organizing principle,&quot; which fully defined the phrase &quot;past pattern of criminal abuse,&quot; and it had &quot;distinguishing characteristics&quot; by its reference to a carefully limited number of criminal acts and a narrow group of victims. The evidence was also sufficient to support the verdict because it clearly established a history of past abuse. Also, second-degree intentional murder was established, and a heat of passion defense that could have resulted in a lesser conviction of manslaughter was refuted, as the evidence was insufficient to show the victim's actions provoked defendant's use of a knife to stab her 19 times. Admission of autopsy photos was proper to prove intent and premeditation.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the &quot;same offense&quot; language used in Minn. R. Crim. P. 17.06, subd. 4(3) did not limit or restrict the State's subsequent charging decision and did not create an additional form of statutory double jeopardy protection that would effectively acquit defendant of all offenses arising out of the same behavioral incident that were greater in degree than the particular offense originally charged. The court concluded that, after the indictment was dismissed for a curable defect, the grand jury could return a second indictment charging the defendant with an offense that was different from, in addition to, or greater in degree than, the offense charged in the original indictment.

On appeal, defendant contended that his constitutional rights were violated by the trial court's admission of protection order affidavits and transcripts, that Minn.

The representative sought to garnish the judgment debtor's IRA. After several appeals and remands, the appellate court found that &sect; 550.37, subd. 24 was constitutional. Accordingly, the judgment debtor's IRA was exempt from garnishment. The representative appealed. The court held that the representative demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 550.37, subd. 24(1) violated the Minnesota Constitution. Section 550.37, subd. 24(1) contained no limit on the amount that may be accumulated in an IRA. Therefore, the clause violated Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, which provided that a reasonable amount of property was exempt from seizure or sale for the payment of any debt or liability. Under Minn.

The injured person filed a claim under &sect; 1983 for the use of excessive force and state assault and battery claims. The appellate court affirmed denial of the officer's summary judgment motion. On appeal, the court affirmed and remanded the cause for trial. The court found that the law governing the officer's actions was clearly established at the time that he acted. The use of excessive force was clearly prohibited by a general constitutional standard; the contours of the standard for the use of force alleged in the case were further established by statute, and those standards were incorporated in the training materials used by the Minneapolis police department. Those sources taken together provided an unusually strong basis for finding that the injured person had met her burden. Therefore, the court held that the injured person had submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact in dispute and evidence to support factual findings that would have placed the conduct at issue outside the protection of qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

In its order committing the inmate to the hospital for an indefinite period of time, the trial court used the Pearson test language. It was not enough, however, for the trial court to use this language in a conclusory fashion when the expert testimony upon which it relied had been given in terms of the statutory definition.

Initially, the court entered a judgment in favor of the bank. The Supreme Court vacated the court's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration.

Before trial, the prosecutor moved to certify the misdemeanor charge as a petty misdemeanor pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.131(1) and appellant objected. Appellant argued that Minn. R. Crim. P. 23.04, which required the State to obtain a defendant's consent before treating a misdemeanor violation as a petty misdemeanor, superseded Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.131(1). The trial court ruled that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.131(1) governed the certification process and permitted the reduction over appellant's objection. The trial court denied appellant's demand for a jury trial on the ground that a petty misdemeanor was not a crime. The Rules of Criminal Procedure took precedence over statutes to the extent that there was any inconsistency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed an action against respondent manufacturer for breach of warranty and appellant engineers for negligence. The breach of warranty action was barred by the statute of limitations and the negligence claim was remanded. The city settled with the engineers, but the trial court denied the manufacturer's motion for summary judgment on the engineers' crossclaim. The Court of Appeals (Minnesota) reversed and the engineers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court certified several questions to the court for clarification. On certification, the court sought to determine whether the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) statute of limitations barred the engineers' contribution-indemnity crossclaim. The court determined that the engineers' crossclaim for contribution-indemnity was not based on a contract for the sale of goods but on the equitable proposition that it paid more than its fair share of common liability to the city. The manufacturer argued that the four-year statute of limitations should apply to the engineers' crossclaim because it erroneously assumed that the crossclaim involved the type of commercial transaction that was within the sole province of the U.C.C. However, the engineers never had a contract with the manufacturer and thus, were never in a position to bargain for contractual provisions to protect itself against liability. Therefore, the engineers' crossclaim for contribution-indemnity against the manufacturer was not subject to, and was not barred by the U.C.C.'s four-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment. The court held that the four-year statute of limitations provided for in the U.C.C. did not apply to the engineers' crossclaim because it was not based on a contract action.</SPAN></P>

A psychologist who interviewed defendant and administered several psychological tests and determined that defendant met the profile of a sex offender.

Furthermore, the language of the statute met the due process requirement that facts found at the sentencing stage had to be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant's sentence was not cruel or unusual based upon the circumstances of the crime.

The court allowed evidence of defendant's prior conviction for criminal sexual assault to impeach defendant. Minn. R.

The court also held that Minn. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review and the issue presented on appeal was whether the state's present system of educational finance was sufficient to meet the state constitutional requirement that the legislature establish a general and uniform system of public schools and provide sufficient financing to secure a thorough and efficient system of public schools. The trial court ruled that 1) education was a fundamental right, 2) property wealth or property tax base was a suspect classification under this constitutional provision, and 3) wealth-based disparities between districts resulted in an &quot;impermissible absence of uniformity&quot; in the state educational system. The court agreed with the first finding but rejected the last two findings and reversed the decision. The court held that the school districts and parents were unable to establish that the basic system was inadequate or that the &quot;general and uniform&quot; requirement implied full equalization of local referendum levies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Minnesota), which affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to respondents, unmarried adults without children who resided in Minnesota less than six months and applied for general assistance benefits after July 1, 1991, in respondents' class action against the department's application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 256D.065.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department argued that there was a compelling state interest in residency requirements for persons applying for access to the state's welfare benefits. The court held that the residency requirements were unconstitutional because Minn. Stat. &sect; 256D.065 (1991 Amendment) violated the constitutional right to travel and the federal Equal Protection Clause. The court stated that the question was whether the right to travel had been so burdened by the durational residency requirement that the statute's classification required strict scrutiny rather than minimal rational basis analysis. The court found that the 1991 Amendment clearly implicated the right to travel. If a needy resident of Minnesota had resided there less than six months, they received only 60 percent of the benefits that other needy residents of Minnesota received. These two classes were composed of equally needy welfare recipients, but members of the first class, solely because of a shorter residency, had their benefits reduced 40 percent. The court held that the conservation of state funds was not a compelling reason to penalize the exercise of the right to freely migrate and settle in another state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charitable organizations brought an action against the Commissioner of Revenue in which they challenged the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 349.212(6) (1989), which imposed a graduated tax on combined receipts derived from tipboard and pull-tab games in a given year. Combined receipts were defined in &sect; 349.212(6) as the sum of an organization's gross receipts from lawful gambling less gross receipts directly derived from the conduct of bingo, raffles, and paddlewheels. The trial court affirmed the constitutionality of &sect; 349.212(6) and the court affirmed its decision. The organizations argued that the imposition of a graduated gross receipts tax violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In tax legislation, lines drawn to classify taxpayers were constitutional if they were based on any reasonable measurement. The State of Minnesota had a special interest in both charitable organizations and legalized gambling. Certain previous judicial decisions had worried that graduated gross receipts taxes might interfere with commerce. By contrast, the purpose of &sect; 349.212(6) was to prevent commercialization.</SPAN></P>

An appellate court affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence. On further appeal, the court affirmed. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the statutes involved, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.344, 609.345, applied not only to medical imposters but also to licensed professionals. The statutes applied to any act of sexual penetration or contact accomplished by means of a false representation that it was for a bona fide medical purpose. A warrant that requested complete patient files of all females with certain birthdates who had family practice services was not overbroad given the nature of the activity under investigation. Admission of expert opinion testimony that defendant's conduct did not serve a &quot;bona fide medical purpose&quot; was proper. The mere fact that testimony embraced an ultimate issue did not render it objectionable. Evidence from certain patients was properly excluded as cumulative because defendant took the stand, was permitted to present evidence from an expert witness, and was allowed to present the testimony of seven other former patients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The woman was committed to a state hospital and was treated with nueroleptic drugs with a public appointed guardian making the decision.

The court held that the case was capable of repetition and upheld the statute. The court rejected the woman's claim that the state should be enjoined from providing intrusive therapy, such as neuroleptic drugs, without the consent of a nonpublic guardian ad litem or court order. The court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.03, subd. 6c (1992) outlined the criteria for administering nueroleptic drugs to mentally ill patients, which consisted of five requirements, whereas Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.04, subd. 6a (1992) provided only one requirement for administering nueroleptic drugs to mentally retarded persons.

The trial court failed to determine if the prosecutor articulated a facially race-neutral explanation for striking the juror in question and that the proffered reason was the actual bases for the challenge or whether it was offered to mask a discriminatory intent or purpose. Although the trial court interviewed the minor witness prior to closing the courtroom to the public, it failed to disclose evidence or findings of a showing that closure was necessary to protect the minor witness or ensure the fairness of the trial.

The court answered the certified question in the negative and found no violation of either the state or federal constitutions. Nothing in the Due Process Clause prohibited states from making changes in their criminal laws in order to make convictions easier; therefore, &sect; 152.023, subd. 2(2) did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

Finally, the court held that &sect; 152.023, subd. 2(2) was not arbitrary in its enforcement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature authorized the issuance of public bonds to finance two publicly-owned air navigation facilities. Officials of the state, the Commission, and the airline entered into agreements designed to bring the financing arrangement to fruition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation was constituted of organizations that distributed commercial telephone solicitations utilizing ADADs, machines that selected telephone numbers by computer program and dialed those numbers consecutively, at random, or at predetermined intervals. If the machine selected a number that was busy, it disconnected and immediately dialed the next programmed number, returning to the previously engaged number at a later time. Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 325E.26-31 regulated use of the devices. The corporation challenged the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 325E.26-31 as it applied to its use of ADADs. It argued that the statute imposed a prior restraint on speech. The court affirmed the appellate court's determination that &sect;&sect; 325E.26-31 withstood commercial speech scrutiny, as the State had substantial interests in enforcing the statute. The court held that &sect;&sect; 325E.26-31 did not ban the commercial speech, it only regulated it. The court held that the statute was narrowly tailored to achieve its desired objective.

The Court of Appeals (Minnesota) reversed the trial court's dismissal of the action as barred by the statute of limitations under Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) (1988). The manufacturer and distributor challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer maintained that the two year statute of limitations applied because the patio doors constituted improvements to real property and that the injury was claimed to have resulted in the diminution or reduction in value of the home as a result of the claimed defective doors. The court reversed the decision of the lower court and held that their claim was time barred. Under &sect; 541.051 a claim arising out of the defective and unsafe condition of real property had to be brought within two years after discovery of the injury. The failure of the patio doors to prevent an invasion of flies constituted an unsafe condition because it breached the security that the doors were intended to provide. The lower court's view that the statute did not apply because there was no risk of bodily harm was erroneous because it would lead to the absurd result of providing a longer limitations period where there was no risk of bodily harm than if there was such a risk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was terminated from her position as a nursing home administrator for the county. She failed to file a petition for a writ of certiorari so that she could obtain judicial review of the termination decision. Instead, the employee brought a wrongful termination action. The trial court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that the employee's failure to obtain review by writ of certiorari within 60 days of notice of her dismissal was fatal. The appellate court reversed and held that the employee was not limited to the review afforded on certiorari and allowed the action to proceed. The court reversed and reinstated the trial court's dismissal. The court held that the employee was not entitled by statute to appeal the decision by traditional means. The county was not subject to the Minnesota Administrative Procedure Act, and no statute provided appeal to the courts from an administrative termination decision. The standard of review on certiorari was more appropriate to the termination decision than would be the standard of review of an independent proceeding. Certiorari ensured expedient review of a fresh record.</SPAN></P>

The citizen challenged the commission's ability to establish off-track betting in light of the language of Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 8, which authorized only on-track betting on horseracing. On review, the court issued the writ of quo warranto to the commission. The court first considered that it was vested with original jurisdiction to issue any writs and processes, including quo warranto, as &quot;necessary to the execution of the laws and the furtherance of justice,&quot; under Minn. Stat. &sect; 480.04 (1990). The court held that quo warranto jurisdiction as it once existed in the district court was reinstated and that petitions for the writ of quo warranto and information in the nature of quo warranto would be filed in the first instance in the district court. The court reasoned that the complexity of the issues of public significance had required reliance upon the district court for its development of a record.

In doing so, the court held that in light of the language of the Act, the absence of legislative intent to exclude religiously affiliated organizations, stare decisis, and the Minnesota rules of statutory construction, the high school was covered by the Act unless constitutional limitations prohibited such coverage. The court went on to hold that neither the First Amendment to the United States Constitution nor Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 prohibited such coverage under the Act.

The foster parents and her maternal grandparents both filed petitions to adopt her after the parental rights of her natural mother and father were terminated. The trial court granted the grandparents' petition, based on the family preference for adoption of minority children expressed in Minn. Stat. &sect; 259.28, subd. 2 (1990). The court of appeals held the statute unconstitutional, but affirmed the trial court's result, based on a common-law preference for family placements. The court affirmed the adoption by the maternal grandparents concluding that the child be placed for adoption in the home of her grandparents, consistent with the order of the trial court. The court stated that the touchstone of its analysis, as always, was the best interests of the child, and consistent with that principle, the court held that adoptive placement with relatives was presumptively in a child's best interests, unless good cause to the contrary or detriment to the child were shown.</SPAN></P>

The Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, holding that the ordinance's &quot;clean and sanitary condition&quot; language was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct and the City petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted because her home was unfit for human habitation and dangerous to life and health because of severe clutter and vermin infestation. She had been given multiple opportunities to clean the premises but she failed to do so. The court held that defendant laced standing to bring a facial challenge to the ordinance because it did not reach constitutionally protected conduct and she engaged in some conduct that is clearly proscribed. The ordinance was not unconstitutional as applied. The ordinance was not vague because defendant received fair warning of what the ordinance prohibited in the multiple notices. Most reasonable people could agree on an acceptable standard of &quot;clean and sanitary&quot; in the context of a housing code ordinance. Furthermore, the city applied specific subsections of the ordinance dealing with rubbish and pest control, and the prosecution occurred only after defendant failed to comply with the other enforcement provisions in the code. No evidence was introduced to show that the ordinance was enforced in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prior litigation concerned the breach of a distributor contract. The district court held the litigants had violated the contract. The appellate court reversed and entered judgment for the litigants. The distributor satisfied the judgment. Unbeknownst to three branches of the court and the distributor's counsel there was a statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 80E (1990), which controlled the outcome in favor of the distributor. It was determined that the litigants' counsel knew of the statute and did not disclose it during the course of trial. The distributor filed the motion to vacate and the second cause of action seeking relief under &sect; 80E. The court held a judgment that was paid and satisfied as of record ceased to have any existence, leaving nothing to vacate. The court held the district court lacked authority to vacate the judgment. The court held the distributor had full and fair opportunity in the first cause of action to raise the &sect; 80E claim but failed to do so. The court held that as the judgment in the first action constituted a final judgment on the merits, res judicata barred the distributor from bringing a second action asserting a new theory of recovery on the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Minnesota), which determined that Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.241, an obscenity statute, was void pursuant to Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The lower court's decision had invalidated defendant's conviction for distributing obscene materials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.241 violated Minn. Const. art I, &sect; 3, a free speech clause. Defendant further asserted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.241 was overbroad in violation of Minn. Const. art I, &sect; 7, which was a due process clause, and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.241 violated the right of privacy under the state constitution. The court held that &sect; 617.241 did not violate the free speech clause because the United States Supreme Court had determined that obscenity was not protected speech. Thus, although Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, offered broader protection than U.S. Const. amend. I., such protection did not extend to obscenity. Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.241 was not overbroad because it did not bar a protected expression, which was a requirement of invalidity. Section 617.241 did not violate any right to privacy because the right to privacy did not extend to commercial transactions in obscenity. Defendant's conviction was deemed proper on the merits because the evidence depicted sexual acts specifically barred by &sect; 617.241, was patently offensive by community standards, appealed to the prurient interest in sex, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 290.361 (1984) (repealed 1987), violative of 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124(a), but declining to grant tax refunds. The court affirmed that decision, however, the United States Supreme Court issued a remand order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The banks sought refunds of excise taxes imposed upon interest from federal obligations, alleging that the bank excise tax, which exempted interest upon State obligations from the tax, was a discriminatory income tax. The banks were denied refunds in the trial court, and the court affirmed that judgment. Considering the matter on remand, the court reversed its conclusion that the Memphis Bank rule applied only prospectively. A decision rendered by the Supreme Court after the court's original opinion held that it was error to refuse to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after a case announcing the rule did so. Principles of equality and stare decisis prevailed over claims based on Chevron Oil analysis, the decision reasoned. The court then affirmed the portion of its earlier judgment that applied the acceptance-of-benefits doctrine to the tax case. Because the banks accepted the benefits of the exemption for State obligation interest, they were estopped from challenging the constitutionality of the law. Finally, the court upheld its earlier decision to sever the discriminatory portion of the bank tax. The equities of the case required denial of the refunds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reaffirmed the portion of its earlier judgment denying tax refunds and reversed the part of the judgment that concluded the Memphis Bank rule did not apply retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sports facility was built and operated pursuant to 1977 Minn. Laws ch. 89, codified at Minn.

The county put the sports facility on the tax rolls and the lower court held that the leased property was subject to taxation. In 1985, the legislature amended Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.556, subd. 4 (1990) to provide that real or personal property leased by a public sports facility to another person for the purposes of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 473.551 to .595 (1990) was tax exempt. In response to petitions by the sports facility and a professional sports team, the lower court held that the 1985 exemption was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that once a rational basis for a legislative classification was established, the legislature was not required to use the least burdensome means to solve an economic problem. It found that assistance to state industry by special tax benefits was a legitimate legislative purpose and the statutory classification was &quot;genuine or relevant&quot; to a purpose that was based on genuine and substantial distinctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.023(2) and they jointly filed motions to dismiss the charges on the ground that the statute had a discriminatory impact on black persons. The trial court found that a far greater percentage of blacks than whites were sentenced for possession of three or more grams of crack cocaine under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.023 with more severe consequences than their white counterparts who possessed three or more grams of cocaine powder. The trial court concluded that the law had a discriminatory impact on black persons. The certified question before the court was whether Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A question of law was certified from United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, in the debtors' Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, as to whether appellant debtors' claims for general damages and future special damages for bodily injury, claimed as exempt from the claims of appellee trustee on behalf of creditors under Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.37, subd. 22 (1990), contravened Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code, ch. 7, and claimed an exemption for damages sustained in an accident by the debtor wife pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.37, subd. 22 (1990). The trustee challenged the claim of exemption. The bankruptcy court determined that the statute was unconstitutional and certified to the court the question of whether the exemption violated the provisions of Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court held that: (1) the &quot;reasonable amount&quot; language of the constitution required some value limitation but it did not require a specific value; (2) because the general damages portion of a right of action for personal injuries represented the monetary restoration of the physically and mentally damaged person, claims for general damages could never constitute an unreasonable amount of property for purposes of exemption; (3) whatever value a debtor's person had, it was a reasonable amount for purposes of exemption; and (4) the legislature could confer on the courts a discretionary power to ascertain the limit of the exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the negativeand held that the statutory exemption of the debtors' personal injury damage claims from the claims of creditorswas not unconstitutional and that the language used did not contain inadequate limitations on the use of the exemption.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the indictments based on the argument that the indictments violated due process and freedom to practice their religion rights. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the spiritual healing and prayer exception to the child neglect statute did not apply to the manslaughter statute, but that the State had failed to clearly define when reliance on spiritual healing became criminal conduct. The State appealed. The court held: (1) the child neglect statute and the second degree manslaughter statute were not in pari materia because their language and purpose were not closely related; (2) child neglect statute exception's language did not satisfy the fair notice requirement of due process; and (3) the State could not prosecute conduct that was clearly excepted and permitted by statute without violating due process.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.14 (1990), and that the interrogation was in violation of his right to counsel. He also alleged the prosecutor's peremptory strikes of an African-American juror and of younger jurors were discriminatory and that the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct during his closing argument. The court held that defendant failed to show any prejudice from publicity and that &sect; 609.14, subd. 1allows the court to revoke probation without notice. Also, the arrest was lawful even if the officer making the arrest had an improper motive. The prosecutor offered a race-neutral reason for striking the juror and age-based classifications were not subject to strict scrutiny.

With regard to the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant asserted that the record did not sufficiently show premeditation because he was clearly intoxicated at the time of the crimes. The court held that a finding of intoxication did not raise a presumption that defendant was incapable of premeditated murder and that other circumstances tended to prove premeditation. Regarding his admissions, defendant specifically claimed that the police ignored his explicit invocation of his right to counsel. The State conceded that defendant made an equivocal request for counsel by asking the police whether they thought he should have an attorney. The court held that the request required the police to stop questioning.

The court reasoned that the point at which an individual suspected of driving while intoxicated was asked to submit to blood alcohol content testing constituted a critical stage in the criminal prosecution process and therefore triggered the right to consult with counsel guaranteed by Minn.

Thus, the trial court found the agreement valid and enforceable. The court of appeals upheld the trial court's conclusions, rejected General Mills' constitutional arguments, and suggested that General Mills waived any right to terminate the contract by continuing to accept benefits under the contract. The court affirmed. The court held that the trial court correctly determined that the language of the contract was unambiguous. The plain language of the contract contemplated a situation in which &sect; 473.568 could be repealed and the agreement would remain in effect. Although the inability of the Vikings to comply with &sect; 473.568 was a condition precedent, the existence of &sect; 473.568 was not a condition precedent.

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the ordinance potentially censored so many constitutionally protected activities on its face that it had to be invalidated. The court found that the ordinance could be narrowly construed to reach only conduct that fell outside First Amendment protection. The court noted that the ordinance did not on its face assume that any cross burning, irrespective of the particular context in which it occurred, was subject to prosecution. Rather, the ordinance censored only those displays that one knew or should known would create anger, alarm or resentment based on racial, ethnic, gender or religious bias. This conduct was analogous to &quot;fighting words&quot; because it was conduct that itself inflicted injury or tended to incite immediate violence. Whenever the &quot;anger, alarm or resentment&quot; the ordinance spoke of rose to the level of &quot;imminent lawless action,&quot; the city was permitted to intervene and censor the provocative conduct.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the amendment, the Fund was obligated to reimburse a subsequent employer for all compensation that was paid when medical evidence established that more than 50 percent of an injury was attributable to preexisting impairments. The amended version of &sect; 176.131(1) governed the issue because the controlling event in order to determine whether the former employer was liable to the Fund for apportionment was the date of the second injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony theft for filing false Medicaid claims and placed on probation. When the trial court discharged defendant from probation, the discharge order deemed the offense to be for a misdemeanor under Minn.

The court held that because defendant was originally convicted of felony theft, the trial court correctly imposed the firearms restriction upon his discharge from probation. The operation of &sect; 609.13 did not affect the applicability of &sect; 609.165, subd. 1a. Section 609.165, subd. 1a did not impose the consequences of a felony, but imposed consequences based on an offender's commission of certain criminal acts, which the legislature believed to be an indication of a propensity to abuse firearms in the future. It was the nature of the offense, not the treatment of the offender, that was the basis for the imposition of the firearms restriction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, operator and spouse, filed an action against defendants, seller, manufacturer, and intermediate seller, for injuries arising from plaintiff operator falling from a tractor. The trial court found that defendant seller alone was negligent and awarded plaintiff damages. Upon review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that defendant seller waived its right to a jury trial where defendant went no further to secure a jury trial than to simply mark &quot;jury trial&quot; designation on a pretrial questionnaire and the matter was never mentioned again until the morning of trial. The court determined that the evidence supported the findings that neither defendant manufacturer nor defendant intermediate seller were negligent because it showed that a grab handle that caused the accident was tight and secure when it left their possession. The court found the trial court erroneously declared a statute placing a limitation on the amount of recovery allowed for intangible losses in a tort action, Minn. Stat.

When the trial court held that anonymous reports of child abuse were permitted and schools could conduct interviews without the consent and presence of the parent, the parent appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed in part, and the State appealed. On review, the court held that a reading of the plain language of Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which held that Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hit his 21-month old son in the mouth while the child was standing on a chair. The child fell to the floor, hit his head and stopped breathing. Several weeks later, defendant and his family were visiting friends in another county. The child began convulsing and was taken to a hospital where he went into a coma. The State prosecuted defendant in the county where the hospital was located, not the county where defendant hit his son. Defendant argued that &sect; 627.15 violated his right, under Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6, to a trial by jury in the district where the crime occurred. The lower appellate court's reversal of the conviction was reversed and the conviction reinstated. The court held that &sect; 627.15 comported with Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. In light of the hidden nature of child abuse and the emerging magnitude of the problem, the legislature enacted &sect; 627.15 to permit a criminal action arising out of an incident of alleged child abuse to be prosecuted either in the county where the alleged abuse occurred or in the county where the child was found.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The banks sought refunds for several tax years on bank excise taxes paid pursuant to &sect; 290.361.

The district court ordered the state to refund the taxes that were paid during those years. The court held that: (1) the excise tax was a franchise tax and was discriminatory for banks doing business in the state; (2) interest earned on federal obligations was included in the taxable net income figure used to compute the excise tax; (3) certain state bond enabling statutes overrode provisions of Minn. Stat. ch. 290 and exempted earned interest from inclusion in income in the calculation of ch. 290 taxes; (4) the district court abused its discretion in its refusal to apply Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmer filed an action against three law enforcement officers, alleging state tort claims and seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The action arose after the farmer's vehicle was stopped on his way home from working in his fields. After an initial traffic stop in which one officer threatened to arrest the farmer for not having a driver's license, a police chase ensued. When the farmer was pulled over a second time, a law enforcement officer shot out the farmer's tires and threatened to shoot him prior to arresting and handcuffing him. The trial court granted summary judgment to all the officers on the federal and state tort claims. On appeal, the summary judgment was affirmed in favor of all but one officer. The court reversed and affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment, holding that the one officer had probable cause to arrest the farmer and take him into custody for fleeing, that excessive force was not used in shooting out the farmer's tires, and that the officer had qualified immunity for the handcuffing. Because the jury could infer that the officer committed assault in threatening the farmer, the case was remanded for trial of the assault issue.</SPAN></P>

The legislature later amended the law to provide expressly that the property was tax exempt. Notwithstanding the amendment, the city assessor left the leased property on the tax rolls. The court reversed the order dismissing the action, finding that the county had standing. The county and the city assessor played essentially ministerial roles. Compliance with the law required nothing more than not placing the property on the tax rolls.

The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, but certified two questions to the supreme court regarding the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 609.2661(1) and 609.2662(1). First, the supreme court held the statutes did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV failing to distinguish between a viable and a nonviable fetus. Roe v. Wade protected a woman's choice and did not provide a third party unilateral right to destroy fetuses. Second, the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague.

In affirming the judgment, the court held that the appellate court correctly determined that the owners did not have a constitutionally protected right to the continued use of an existing gas distribution system rather than a new system. After finding that the city's decision to upgrade its gas distribution system was a policy decision, which did not lend itself to judicial intrusion, the court ruled that the city's failure to afford the owners a hearing before implementing changes in the delivery system was not a violation of due process standards. In addition, the city did not impair a property interest of the owners that was legally cognizable for eminent domain purposes. Furthermore, the owner's claims under equal protection failed because the differences in the city's installation of pipelines on different streets was shown to have a rational basis. Finally, the court held that the city's actions did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

Laws 2805-06, a law authorizing the district to acquire property for a regional park without local consent or approval by any affected municipality or other local governmental unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and residents argued that the park bill was a special law subject to the consent requirements of Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 and that the bill contained more than one subject in violation of Minn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 17. The court upheld the judgment finding the park bill constitutional. The park bill specifically designated the agencies authorized and directed to acquire land and develop the park in accordance with a master plan. The bill was a special law and, by authorizing acquisition of land for the park without local consent, enabled the park district to exercise authority not granted by general law. Therefore, there was no requirement that affected local government units approve the park bill before it became effective. The city was not identified by name in the park bill and was affected by the legislation only when and if the agencies and the park district carried out the legislative directive by following their master plan. The city was not allowed to veto the park bill to which the agency was charged with the duty of ultimate approval of the comprehensive plans of all local governmental units in a seven-county metropolitan area as well as the park.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 60D.12, subd. 1, which provided for review &quot;by trial de novo.&quot; The district court dismissed the petition, holding that the Commissioner's functions were primarily executive in nature and that, therefore, the &quot;trial de novo&quot; provision improperly delegated executive power to it. The court of appeals agreed and affirmed. On further appeal, the court reversed. The court agreed that the Commissioner's function in the case was essentially administrative. However, the court disagreed with the lower courts' expansive interpretation of the trial de novo provision. The court held that the district court's role in a proceeding under the provision should be limited to traditional judicial functions, such as reviewing the record and determining whether there was sufficient evidence to support the Commissioner's findings and whether the parties received procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question of state law was whether Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 510.01 and 510.02 were unconstitutional as violative of Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The debtors were husband and wife. The bankruptcy trustee objected to the debtors' claimed homestead exemption. The trustee conceded the statutory requirements for the homestead exemption had been met, but contended the Minnesota homestead exemption was unconstitutional under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court found that absent overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the court was compelled to reaffirm 123 years of consistent and indisputable interpretation of constitutionality of the Minnesota homestead exemption. Wanting to preserve as much of one's property in spite of bankruptcy was a natural human desire and a home was often a debtor's largest asset. The problem facing the court was to avoid unfair retention of assets by debtors. However, it was not fraudulent to do what the law allowed. The law permitted the transferring of assets into exempt property, even exemptions without a value limit, before bankruptcy. The court therefore answered the certified question in the negative and the homestead exemption was held constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility asserted that within the commercial-industrial class, to which its personal property was assigned, the counties unequally assessed its personal property. Over two years, the utility's personal property was included in two different classes. In the first year, its personal property was included in Class 4, which included commercial-industrial real and personal property, plus other property not specifically included in another particular class. In the second year, the utility's property was included in Class 3a, which only covered commercial-industrial property. The court found that the utility's distribution system was deemed &quot;personal property&quot; subject to ad valorem taxation. The court noted that the counties assessed the utility's personal property at 100 percent of market value while other similar property was assessed at below market value. Using Assessment-Sales Ratio Studies published by the Department of Revenue, the utility sought to argue that its property received unequal treatment by the counties.

The court determined that although the earlier action did not dispose of the substantive aspects of the claim, it operated as a bar to any future action based on res judicata.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, members of the Amish religion, were charged with violating &sect; 169.522, subd. 1, which required slow-moving vehicles to display a fluorescent orange-red triangular sign emblem when operated on the state's public highways. Claiming that the emblems compromised a religious belief against loud colors, defendants argued that &sect; 169.522, subd. 1&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed upon the right to freely exercise religious beliefs. After the trial court rejected defendants' argument, review was sought. In holding that &sect; 169.522, subd. 1 had infringed upon defendants' rights under the Free Exercise Clause, the court found that defendants had a sincerely held religious belief even though the belief was not shared by the religious community as a whole. The court also found that &sect; 169.522, subd. 1 had burdened the exercise of this belief because defendants had faced a choice of either adhering to the belief and suffering criminal sanctions or rejecting the belief in order to comply with &sect; 169.522, subd. 1. Finally, the court found that the state's public safety interest would not be significantly diminished if a less restrictive alternative was used.</SPAN></P>

R. Evid. 803(4). The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 595.02, subd. 4(c) established a permissible exception to the confrontation clause because it required a specific finding that the denial of the right to confrontation was necessary to effectuate public policy and that protecting child witnesses from trauma was an important public policy. The court held that the Coy requirement of &quot;individualized finding&quot; by the trial court was insufficient. The trial court made no finding that it was necessary to exclude defendant during her testimony due to psychological traumitization.

R. 9500.1258, subpara. 1M(8) (1987).</SPAN></P>

When permanent rules were instituted, the recipient could not meet the requirement for six hours of classroom instruction per week, and she was denied further benefits. The appellate court held the rule requiring six hours of instruction was unreasonable because, as to the recipient and others for whom no GED program with the requisite hours was available, the rule was invalid as arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. On appeal, the court held that although the rule could yield a harsh or undesirable result in a particular case, that did not make the rule invalid. The court held that saying a rule was &quot;invalid as applied&quot; meant the rule was invalid if, as employed, it was unreasonable in a due process sense, and that the rule was not rationally related to the legislative ends sought to be achieved. The court concluded the rule had a rational basis and the Department did not exceed its statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowner appealed the decision from the court of appeals (Minnesota), which affirmed the decision of the trial court that petitioner city was not liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The lower appellate court also affirmed the landowner's claims for negligence and estoppel. However, it placed a damages cap under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.04 (1986). The city also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city gave the landowner permits to destroy a building and construct a new one. However, the new building violated zoning restrictions. The city decided to revoke the permit to build, but it did not inform the landowner until construction had begun. On appeal, the court agreed with the lower courts in part. The landowner's action sounded in tort, rather than as an inverse condemnation action. The landowner relied on the city's negligence to his detriment. The city was not immune from tort liability since the decision to issue an unlawful permit was not a discretionary act. The landowner could not have been charged with knowledge of the law since the zoning rule was unwritten. The statutory damages cap under &sect; 466.04 was not an affirmative defense. The damages cap was constitutional. The lower appellate court erred in calculating damages as the lost rental space in the old building should have been the measure. Estoppel was a shield and not a basis for recovery. The 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim failed since the landowner had no property interest for an erroneously issued permit. Further, the landowner failed to prove damages to support a due process claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower appellate court was affirmed in part, but the damages award was modified and lowered, and the cause was remanded. The city was negligent, and it did not have governmental tort immunity. The statutory damages cap was not an affirmative defense. Estoppel could not have been a basis for awarding damages. There was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the order. The court found that to accept any of the corporation's arguments regarding the deduction of net operating losses from its Minnesota income required that fundamental principles of statutory construction be ignored. The court determined that by requiring corporations to apportion their net operating loss carryovers, the state achieved its purpose of fairly allocating tax burdens and allowing deductions on a proportionate basis to income. The court found that the statute at issue applied equally to all companies doing business within and without Minnesota and apportioning their income, and thus did not violate the equal protection clause.

The court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.556(6) was neither unconstitutionally overbroad or vague, that the statute permitted conviction only where a prudent person would have reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, and that it did not require a mandated reporter to espouse a viewpoint with which he did not agree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's business involved the manufacture and sale of business machines and equipment. The corporation received royalty payments from the foreign subsidiaries. The corporation's gross income also included dividend payments made to it by its foreign subsidiaries. The corporation filed its corporate tax returns for the tax years in question. On audit, the commissioner included that income in the corporation's apportionable income. The corporation challenged the commissioner's action of including the foreign income by appealing to the tax court. The tax court upheld the commissioner's order and the corporation appealed. The court held that the corporation did not provide the court with evidence of any clear federal directive which precluded Minnesota from applying its apportionment formula as it did. The court found that the commissioner correctly interpreted Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.19 (1980) and that his interpretation did not violate either the Due Process or the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The commissioner properly excluded sales made, payroll paid, and property used factors of relator's foreign subsidiaries from the apportionment formula.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two workers were injured when a crane owned by the workers' employer and designed, made, and inspected by the manufacturer malfunctioned. The workers filed an action against their employer and the manufacturer. The manufacturer filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the crane had become an improvement to real property within the meaning of &sect; 541.051, that it had installed the crane over 18 years prior, and that under &sect; 541.051, the workers' action was barred by the 15-year statute of limitations. The District Court certified two questions to the court regarding the meaning of the phrase &quot;improvement to real property&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 541.051 (1980), and whether the statute of limitations was unconstitutional. The court found that an improvement to real property was a permanent addition that enhanced the capital value of the land, that the crane had become an improvement to the real property, that the statute of limitations legitimately eliminated actions against designers and manufacturers that no longer had any interest or control in the product, and that enforcement of the statute of limitations did not deprive the workers of a remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others were drinking when defendant and the victim began to argue. Defendant asked a friend to get a gun. The friend complied, and defendant held the gun behind his back as the victim approached. Defendant shot the victim twice at close range, and the victim fell to the ground. The victim asked that defendant stop, but defendant shot him twice more. The victim bled to death. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that from the number of shots fired and their close proximity, the jury reasonably concluded the defendant intended to kill the victim. It was also reasonable to conclude that defendant did not fulfill his duty to retreat if possible. Defendant did not carry his burden of proving incapacity due to intoxication. The application of Minn. R. Evid. 403 was constitutional. Even if the trial court erred by excluding testimony on prior street violence, that testimony was duplicative and of little relevance. Likewise, even if the admission of a police videotape of defendant was error, it did not affect the jury's findings. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two volunteer firefighters suffered from atherosclerosis, although neither was aware of his condition. Both experienced heart attacks while fighting fires; one died at the scene and the other died a few days later. Expert testimony was presented that the physical and emotional stress involved in fighting fires was a contributing factor in their deaths. The court affirmed the WCCA's findings that the firefighters were killed in the line of duty and that their dependents were entitled to benefits from the Fund. Both men were actively involved in the dangerous work of fighting fires at the time of their heart attacks, and were eligible for benefits because the Fund was established to recognize the sacrifices made by peace officers in performing hazardous work. The court found that one firefighter's daily wage was improperly calculated where an imputed wage based on the amount paid to full-time firefighters in a nearby city was added to the volunteer's pay from his regular employment. Combining both wages was improper where he was not a regular employee of the volunteer fire department, and the case was remanded for a benefit determination based solely on the imputed wage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer asserted that for two years his agricultural property was assessed in excess of its market value. The tax court denied him relief because all agricultural property in the count was assessed at 115 percent of its market value. The tax court ordered that the assessment of the property be reduced for the first year and that the county refund all money due the taxpayer. The court refused to reduce that assessment for the second year on the basis that it was assessed at 115 percent of its market value. The tax court relied on the assessment/sales ratio study of the Department of Revenue, and determined that a reduction of the taxpayer's assessment would have created an unconstitutional inequality with other similar property in the county. The court reversed and remanded, and held that the taxpayer filed a timely objection to the assessment pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01, subd. 1 (1986), and ordered that the assessment be reduced. The court noted that although the prevailing economic conditions made it difficult to accurately assess the taxpayer's property, those conditions did not constitute a defense to a claim of overassessment under &sect; 278.01, subd. 1.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision and held that &sect; 609.50 constitutional because it was not facially overbroad or vague. The statute was not facially overbroad because it could be used to punish fighting words or any other words that by themselves have the effect of physically obstructing or interfering with a police officer in the performance of his duties. The statute did not apply to ordinary verbal criticism directed at a police officer even while the officer was performing his official duties and did not apply to the mere act of interrupting an officer, even intentionally. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face because persons of common intelligence need not guess at whether their conduct violated the statute where it clearly prohibited only intentional physical obstruction or interference with a peace officer in the performance of his duties and did not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement by the police.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 176.105, subd. 1 (1986), on the employee's claim against respondents, his employer, the insurer, and intervenor Commissioner of Labor and Industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, while at work, accidentally splashed molten aluminum on various parts of his body, and he sustained second and third degree burns. The compensation judge found a two percent disability, allowed under the new disability schedule, pursuant to Minn. R. 5223.0240, subpt. 2(E) and 2(B). The employee claimed the new disability schedule violated the &quot;certain remedies clause,&quot; of Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. He argued that in adopting the new rules, the Commissioner neglected to schedule permanency ratings for sun sensitivity and cold intolerance for anything but the hands, face, and head and eliminated the prior coverage of these areas from the statute. To mount a successful attack on the new disability schedules, the employee had to do more than raise objections to some aspect of the schedules; he was required to show that the overall compensation scheme was not a reasonable substitute for the prior schedule. This he failed to do. The legislature provided an adequate substitute for whatever common-law remedy the new schedule might have abrogated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the compensation judge's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying action, plaintiffs, former and current residents of a Minnesota veterans home, filed an action against defendants, the Minnesota Commissioner of Veterans Affairs and the home administrator, for injunctive and declaratory relief. The veterans prevailed. The trial court awarded the veterans attorney fees under &sect; 1988. The Commissioner appealed. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed. The veterans sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the state legislature authorized the Commissioner to convert a veterans residence to a nursing care facility under 1984 Minn. Laws ch. 654, art. 2, &sect; 19(b), the veterans brought a &sect; 1988 action and also pleaded deprivation of their due process and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court found that the underlying action requested only declaratory and injunctive relief, not damages. The court also found that the action was brought against state officials, the Commissioner and the home administrator, acting in their official capacities. The court determined that, although the veterans failed to plead specifically &sect; 1983 or an &quot;action to enforce a provision of &sect; 1983,&quot; the veterans' pleadings, when considered as a whole, met the minimum requirements to establish a &sect; 1983 claim. In reversing, the court ruled that the veterans were entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to &sect; 1988. The veterans prevailed, the court held, because they showed that they had a protected property right which entitled them to a contested case hearing prior to their discharge or transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that an award of attorney fees to the veterans was proper. The court also awarded the veterans modest appellate attorney fees, their appellate printing costs, and their filing fees on appeal. The court held that no further fees or costs were to be awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs initiated an action alleging assault, battery, trespass, false arrest, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and deprivation of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against the city and the police. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and the police and determined that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The trial court certified the question to the court of whether the city and the police were also entitled to such immunity for the state actions for trespass and battery. The court found that because the police acted with good faith in their belief that exigent circumstances were present to perform the warrantless search, they were protected from tort claims raised by their reasonable actions performed in carrying out such search. The court determined that the police were entitled to immunity because they exercised judgment and discretion in searching and subsequently arresting plaintiffs' son. The court answered the question in the affirmative and found that the city and the police were entitled to immunity for the state claims.

The court determined that the constitutional phrase &quot;impartial jury&quot; imparted a body of 12 persons. The court found that, absent a constitutional amendment, the legislature had no authority to tamper with the number 12 as an essential element of the jury. The court held that Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the complaint specifically alleged that the entire murder was committed outside of Minnesota, it was facially deficient. Consequently, the state had no jurisdiction to prosecute defendant under the complaint. Therefore, the court answered the certified question in the negative and reversed the trial court's judgment. Under the court's precedent Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.025(1986) did not totally abrogate the limitations on extraterritorial jurisdiction which was contravened by state and federal constitutional principles. Some part of the crime had to be committed within Minnesota in order for the state to have jurisdiction to punish the crime. Minn. R. Crim. P. 24.02(4) did not confer jurisdiction because it was merely a rule of venue between counties of the state.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 480.061 (1986), asked certified questions as to when a surviving spouse or next of kin of a decedent died after commencement of a wrongful death action pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 573.02, did plaintiff trustee's claim for damages for pecuniary loss sustained by decedent survive his or her death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee filed a wrongful death action against defendant corporation, claiming the corporation owned the wheel rim and tire, and the collision that caused the decedent's death was the direct result of the corporation's negligence. The court held that when a decedent's surviving spouse or next of kin died after commencement of a wrongful death action, the trustee might have recovered on behalf of the spouse or kin's estate. Damages were limited to pecuniary loss sustained by the beneficiary, and were therefore based only on the period during which the beneficiary actually survived the decedent. While the court allocated the jury's award according to each beneficiary's proportionate pecuniary loss, the fact of a beneficiary's death was required to be available to the jury so it could determine the &quot;fair and just&quot; loss from the decedent's death pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 573.02, subd. 1. This circumstance, the court noted, was an exception to the general rule that evidence of events subsequent to the decedent's death was inadmissible on the issue of damages. Evidence of the beneficiary's death simply fixed that person's life expectancy, which was required otherwise to be estimated.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision. The court noted that no election of coverage had been made for the father's family members. The court observed that while the father had complied with the Act by providing coverage for his employees, he simply was not required to provide coverage for the employee as his daughter. The court stated that while it was not unsympathetic to the employee's situation, where the compensation judge found that the father had no intention to elect coverage for his daughter, the court had no option but to conclude that statutorily she was exempt from the Act's coverage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contended that &sect; 105.391(1), which provided for published notice of the inventory and mapping of the state's wetlands and public waters, was not constitutionally valid on its face, or as applied to him, under the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. Specifically, he asserted that the published notice that was required was inadequate to protect his due process rights. The Department argued that the public waters inventory affected a legislative classification that did not require personal notice and, beyond that, it did not deprive the landowner of property rights protected by the principles due process. The landowner further contended that the reservation of existing rights contained in &sect; 105.38(1) allowed him to enlarge or rebuild private drainage ditches and drain a protected wetland. The court sided with the Department and held that to provide personal notice to all interested persons in the public water inventory process would have been a nearly impossible administrative task. Further, no existing rights pursuant to &sect; 105.38(1) were infringed upon because the landowner did not have a prior right to drain the wetlands.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the complaint against defendant on the grounds that &sect; 609.293 was unconstitutionally broad and infringed, both facially and as applied to defendant, upon the right of privacy guaranteed by the Minnesota Constitution. On appeal, the court held that defendant did not have standing to challenge &sect; 609.293 as facially overbroad because persons not currently before the court did not stand to lose by the outcome of the case, and the persons not before the court retained an effective avenue of preserving their rights. Section 609.293 did not infringe on defendant's fundamental right because the sexual conduct was not &quot;private sexual conduct.&quot; The conduct was not public in the sense that the sexual activity took place outdoors, but because defendant &quot;picked up&quot; the complainant, who was previously unknown to defendant, at or near a public park, recognized as a gathering place of young prostitutes; the sexual contacts between the two were essentially no more than separate &quot;one night stands;&quot; and it was a case of sex for compensation.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court granted the reference motion. The appellate court affirmed the order. On further appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.125 (1986), the only method by which a juvenile alleged to have been a delinquent could have been tried on a criminal complaint as an adult in district court, was by a proceeding initiated by the State in which the juvenile court found the State had proven that the juvenile was not suitable for treatment or that the public safety was not served by the juvenile court laws. Certain statutory rights were afforded juveniles, and at least some of those statutory rights were waivable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of both rape and kidnapping, but the court of appeals determined that the trial court prejudicially erred in admitting certain evidence against defendant of a prior similar crime. Defendant claimed that inasmuch as a prior sexual abuse conviction was committed nine years earlier, it was inadmissible. The court held that in determining relevancy, the other crime must have been similar in some way, either in time, location, or modus operandi. The court found that pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), prior misconduct could have been proven through the use of a prior judgment of conviction. The court held that the trial court had not committed any error in admitting evidence of the prior conviction. The court also found that the court of appeals erred in reversing the kidnapping charge as not being supported by sufficient evidence of confinement or removal of the victim. Under a Minnesota statute, &sect; 609.25, an element of kidnapping failed to include a requirement that the victim be removed a substantial distance or be confined for a long period.

The court affirmed the trial court's decisions denying plaintiff's motions to recall the jurors for questioning, to have the verdict corrected, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. There was no evidence of attorney misconduct.

A different verdict form may have been appropriate to provide the court with the information necessary to do the discounting if there were evidence to support it.

He further found that pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.021, subd. 3(b), the permanent partial disability was presently payable. On appeal, the lower court substituted a finding of 30 percent permanent partial disability. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part.

The court determined that (1) the ability to pay could be taken into consideration by the legislature in classifying property for the purpose of taxation because the market value of property gave some indication of the ability to pay; (2) the preference given to homestead property had a tendency to encourage the use of land for homestead purposes and was in furtherance of a sound public policy; (3) the distinction between owner occupiers and renter occupiers was genuine in light of the added responsibilities of homeowners and their different relation to the property from renters; (4) distinctions between homestead owners and renters justified the different tax treatment between the two; and (5) Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Minnesota, presented four certified questions of law involving Minnesota's property exemption statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Debtor converted significant amounts of nonexempt property into property that was considered to be exempt from attachment or execution. In federal bankruptcy court, certain creditors filed objections to debtor's assertion of those exemptions. The bankruptcy court certified three questions involving the application of Minnesota's property exemption statutes and another question regarding the constitutionality of the statutes to the Supreme Court of Minnesota. The court assumed it had jurisdiction to answer the questions. The court found, in answering the first three questions in the affirmative, that the statutes sheltered debtor's assets from attachment or execution by the creditors. The court also held, however, that the statutes violated the state constitutional prohibitions on exempting an unreasonable amount of property and special legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the statutes did exempt debtor's annuities and life insurance policies, but that the statutes violated the state constitution because the statutes attempted to give absolute exemption regardless of value to annuity contracts and unmatured life insurance purchased from a fraternal benefit association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State imposed an excise tax on wines that was lower for wine manufactured from state-grown grapes. The taxpayers filed a claim with the Commissioner of Revenue for a refund representing the excise taxes that would have been due if the taxpayers had sold state-grown wines. The taxpayers thereafter paid the lower excise taxes and when the Commissioner of Revenue assessed additional taxes, the taxpayers appealed the order to the tax court. The tax court held that the statute imposing the lower tax was unconstitutional but denied the taxpayer's claim for a refund. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that state taxes which had the purpose and effect of discriminating in favor of local products violated the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that the refund requested by the taxpayers was incommensurate with the harm they suffered, as the effect of the unconstitutional statute on the taxpayers' wine sales was minimal and the commissioner's retroactive assessment of taxes on the state wineries was adequate to negate any injury suffered by the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the finding that the employee suffered an occupational disease, the court reversed the decision that the employee was not entitled to benefits. The court reinstated the decision of the compensation judge. Respondent City of St. Paul, Minnesota argued that the statute in which the lower courts based their decisions, Minn.

A rehabilitation review panel denied her claim after it found that she was capable of performing her pre-injury work. The lower appellate court affirmed the denial. On further review, the employee argued that the rehabilitation review panel lacked authority to decide issues of primary liability and medical causation and that her rehabilitation claim included an underlying issue of medical causation that only a compensation judge could determine. In affirming the denial of rehabilitation benefits, the court held that the review panel acted within its jurisdiction in deciding the employee's rehabilitation petition. The court found that no new issue of primary liability or subsequent liability causation was before the panel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was notified that he was required to retire when he turned age 70 pursuant to the provisions of Minn.

The judge filed an action regarding his mandatory retirement and the trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court rejected the judge's contention that mandating retirement was tantamount to a removal of a judge from office for other than the reasons enumerated in the state constitution and that, because the retirement benefits were admittedly less than full salary, his compensation has been diminished during the &quot;term of office&quot; for which he was elected. The court found that the specific legislative mandate for retirement of judges at the age of 70 was a proper exercise of legislative authority. The court held that an automatic vacancy was created and the only action required by the judge was the written application to the governor for retirement.

The court denied relief. The trial court's appended findings of facts were valid legal inferences. The corporations never filed tax returns that set forth a claim of improper assessment as required by the statute of limitations, Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.50, subds.1-2, 4. In any event, the refund claim was invalid on the merits absent statutory underpinning or case law precedent for combined reporting. The U.S. Supreme Court held that states were not constitutionally required to treat as unitary all corporations that functioned in a unitary manner and that the type of three-factor apportionment formula used by Minnesota, which measured the proportion of sales, property, and payroll located in the state, fairly reflected the generation of income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.75 (1984) required Stearns County and 21 other counties to impose a production tax on the removal of aggregate material. The tax was intended to provide funds for the maintenance of local roads and bridges subjected to heavy use by North Dakota gravel haulers. Prior to 1984, the tax had been imposed by special laws and statutes, which variously changed the number of counties that it either allowed or required to impose the tax. The company contended that the 1983 and 1984 enactments were violative of the uniformity clause of the Minnesota Constitution and equal protection. The court rejected those contentions. When judging the constitutionality of a statute singling out one geographical area for differential treatment, there had to be some rational basis for the distinction. In this case, the court found it rational for some counties to impose the tax while others did not. The differing needs and preferences of the counties, coupled with the avoidance of adverse effects upon competition within an economic unit, and the regional characteristics of the aggregate industry afforded a rational basis for the 1983 and 1984 legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Court of Appeals submitted a certified question of law regarding the constitutionality of criminal penalties imposed under Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.941 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.941 (1984), which imposed criminal liability on him for his employee's illegal sale of alcohol to a minor, violated due process. He argued that the public interest in prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors did not justify such an invasion of his personal liberty when there were less burdensome ways to protect it. Plaintiff argued that the statute's constitutionality had already been upheld as necessary to protect the public interest. The court found that criminal penalties based on vicarious liability under the statute violated due process. The court noted that defendant's liberty and reputation were in jeopardy for an offense he did not commit or ratify, and that such an intrusion was unnecessary when the imposition of civil fines or the suspension of licenses would just as effectively protect the public interest in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered affirmatively, holding that criminal penalties imposed under the statute were a violation of substantive due process, because there were alternative means of deterring liquor law violations without intruding on one's personal liberty by punishing him for someone else's crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents filed a wrongful birth action against the health insurer and others, alleging that they were answerable in tort for the Down's Syndrome which afflicted the parents' daughter. The health insurers and others argued in defense that Minn. Stat. &sect; 145.424 barred the parents' action. In cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the trial court adopted the parents' view that the statute was unconstitutional. An interlocutory appeal ensued, in which the court held that: (1) statutes were presumed constitutional, and the party attacking them had to prove them unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) Fourteenth Amendment due process analysis was inapplicable because the statute involved no state action and, even if it did, the statute did not impinge upon a woman's right to an abortion; (3) the statute did not implicate equal protection considerations because no suspect or quasi-suspect classification was involved, and the state had a rational basis for its statutory distinctions; and (4) the statute did not violate Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because that clause only assured remedies for rights vested at common law, which complement did not include wrongful birth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the brewer and wholesaler's contract, the wholesaler agreed not to sell its business without the brewer's permission. After the contract's execution, the Act was passed. It prohibited a brewer from unreasonably withholding consent to allow the sale of a wholesaler's business and applied retroactively under Minn. Stat. &sect; 325B.15 (1984). The trial court found for the wholesaler and prospective buyer under the Act. The court reversed and held that the retroactive application of the Act unconstitutionally impaired the contract under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. In determining whether the retroactive application was unconstitutional, the court had to determine whether the Act substantially impaired a contract right, whether the Act had a significant and legitimate public purpose, and whether the adjustment of contract rights and liabilities was based on reasonable conditions and was appropriate to its public purpose. Because the Act provided rights and damages that did not exist without the Act, there was a substantial impairment of contract rights. Because the Act was private legislation for distributors' benefits, the Act lacked a general public purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the sales tax refund statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.35 (1984), the CDR refused to permit general contractors to retain any excess sales tax refunds received by them and required that the contractors provide adequate assurance that the refunded amount of tax would be remitted to the customers who paid it. On certiorari, the Supreme Court held that the Tax Court and the CDR correctly interpreted the statute. The court held that the contract customer in his capacity as a purchaser actually paid the sales tax, while the contractor in his capacity as a vendor, merely remitted the tax to the State. The court held that the contractors were not entitled to a windfall by virtue of the refund of the excess sales taxes that were erroneously paid, and affirmed the decision below. The court held that the Department of Revenue's interpretation of the refund statute did not unconstitutionally impair the obligation of contract or violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court further held that the right to a refund was both created and limited by the law and that claims for refunds must be brought within the two-year limitations period prescribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In respondent purchaser's action, appellant seller sought review of a judgment of the District Court, Rice County (Minnesota), which held that appellant had breached contract warranties, committed fraud, and violated Minnesota Securities Act, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 80A.01-31, in the sale of a travel agency to respondent. Respondent appealed a holding that respondent had breached the contract and that appellant was entitled to the unpaid contract price.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent contended that appellant breached the contract warranties by failing to accurately reflect the net worth of the agency during negotiations, by failing to disclose that the agency did not comply with regulations as warranted, and by failing to disclose when payments were due for planned tours. Appellant challenged the applicability and constitutionality of the MSA. The court reversed the trial court's award of damages to respondent for breach of warranty as to the overstatement of the agency's worth, the representation on compliance with all laws, and the failure to disclose that the planned tours' tickets were not secured. The court affirmed that appellant breached the contract by fraudulently failing to disclose the prepayment requirements for the planned tours but also affirmed appellant's award for the full contract price. The MSA applied to sale of 100 percent of the agency's stock because the sale was a securities transaction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 80A.14(18). The MSA did not violate equal protection by applying a stricter standard of disclosure to the sale of business through a stock transfer than through a sale of assets. The stock purchaser assumed a greater risk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part, disallowing the majority of respondent's breach of warranty claims. The court affirmed in part, holding that the MSA applied to the agency sale and that, by failing to disclose required travel prepayments, appellant violated the MSA, breached the contract warranty, and committed fraud. The court affirmed appellant's award for the unpaid contract price and remanded for a redetermination of respondent's costs.</SPAN></P>

Laws 2082 (Act). The Treasurer contended that the Act was unconstitutional in that it abolished his executive office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature, in special session, enacted a statute, Act of June 27, 1985, ch. 13, &sect; 13; 1985 Minn. Laws 2082 (Act), provisions of which transferred most of the responsibilities of the Treasurer, an executive officer, to the Commissioner, a statutory position. The Commissioner argued that, like statutes that had previously changed the Treasurer's duties, the statute was a valid exercise of the legislature's power to change the duties of state executive officers in light of public health and welfare demands. The Treasurer contended that the prescribed-by-law provision, Minn. Const. art. V, &sect; 4, did not allow the legislature to transfer inherent or core functions of executive officers to appointed officials. The court held that the Act violated Minn. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and art. IX, &sect; 1. The legislature did not have the option to statutorily abolish a state executive office. The functions and positions of the Treasurer's Office that were transferred by the Act to the Commissioner were to be returned to the Treasurer and the funds appropriated to the Commissioner for such transferred functions and positions were to be added to the appropriation of the Treasurer's Office.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed the claim, and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court determined that two separate groups were established by the statute: those over 65 years of age and those under that age. However, because age was not a suspect class in equal protection analysis, the department needed only to show a rational basis for the distinction. Further, the court noted that, under the federal Medicaid scheme, set forth at 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396, states were required to comply with the recoupment measure to receive federal funding. The court determined that there was a rational basis for the distinction based on age. That is, the requirements for receiving assistance were substantially reduced for those over 65 to allow those people to keep their homes and personal dignity.

The landowners claimed that the taking of their property was not for a public use and that the taking was not necessary for the paper mill project. They also claimed that the municipality failed to comply with applicable condemnation procedures. The court upheld the lower court's judgment. The court ruled that (1) the revitalization of a deteriorating urban area and the alleviation of unemployment were public goals and the taking therefore did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V or Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13; (2) the resolution by the municipality's city council that the taking was necessary was prima facie evidence of that necessity and the landowners failed to rebut it; and (3) the municipality failed to comply with the statutory requirement of consulting with the advisory board before designating the property a development district, but this defect was insubstantial because the delay in obtaining board approval did not prejudice the landowners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee fell from an unsupported platform and injured her back, neck, and knee. She received temporary total disability benefits for 350 weeks. She submitted a request for rehabilitation benefits. A rehabilitation specialist found her eligible. A rehabilitation review panel affirmed the specialist's order and the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals affirmed the panel's decision. The employer and insurer claimed that Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.102, subd. 11(a), prohibited the retroactive application of the rehabilitation statute to the employee, and, if applied, the action would be unconstitutional. In affirming on appeal, the court held that: (1) rehabilitation services were not monetary benefits within the meaning of &sect; 176.102, subd. 11(a), and thus &sect;176.102, subd. 11, could be retroactively applied; and (2) where it was not clear that the statute would result in a greater overall cost to the employer, the legislature expressed a clear intent to have it applied retroactively, and there was no rehabilitation certification under the prior statute so that the employer's obligations had not yet vested, there was no constitutional impediment to the application of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The lower court of appeals affirmed. On certiorari, the doctor contended that Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.102, subd. 10 (1984), and the rules promulgated thereunder violated his constitutional rights of freedom of association for economic gain and equal protection. The court held that: (1) freedom of association did not extend to purely commercial association and because the doctor's sole purpose of association with the company was for financial gain, it did not come under the umbrella of First Amendment protection; and (2) where the purpose of the statute was to lessen the risk of over-prescription of services, it passed constitutional scrutiny under both federal and state constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

The trial court further denied the ex-husband's request to credit the child support payments against the cost of the child's health insurance and the amount he claimed as fair rental value for his one-half interest in the homestead. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.17, subd. 5 (1984) incorporated the child support guidelines into all support cases, not just those involving public assistance children.

A certified question as to the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.13, subd. 2 (Supp. 1985) was presented to the court. The patient challenged the sufficiency of the treatment reports on which the district court based its order, but the court of appeals found the documents to be in accordance with statutory requirements. The court of appeals further ruled that the difference in commitment periods in &sect; 253B.13 was not a violation of equal protection. The indeterminate commitment provided only for mentally retarded patients was, the court found, rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of training and caring for mentally retarded persons. Affirming the judgment of the court of appeals, the court held that the commitment periods in &sect; 253B.13 was based on the legislative judgment that mental retardation was, unlike chemical dependency or mental illness, a condition not usually susceptible of great or rapid improvement. It was not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that indeterminate commitment was an unreasonable means of assuring the state's interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was injured when his aircraft crashed to the ground. An ambulance owned and operated by the county was dispatched to the scene. The ambulance attendants transported him to one hospital without using the siren or red light. They were advised to take the decedent on to a surgical hospital, where he died shortly after the ambulance arrived. In a wrongful death action, the trial court, in ordering that the county be dismissed as a party, concluded that though the ambulance attendants had actual notice of a possible claim, such notice was insufficient under &sect; 466.05 to permit the action to proceed against the county. On appeal, the court reversed the decision by giving retroactive application of new authority that struck the actual notice requirement of &sect; 466.05, as being violative of the equal protection requirements of both the state and federal constitutions. Failure to give notice was a non-jurisdictional defect that could bear upon liability only if the county could show it was prejudiced by the lack of notice. Unless it was determined that the lack of notice prejudiced the county with respect to liability, the trustee was not aggrieved by the notice requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouse alleged that respondent city had refused to certify that the decedent was a police officer killed in the line of duty after he died of a heart attack. The city and the fund denied liability and also asserted that the WCCA lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition. The WCCA ruled that it had jurisdiction, that the decedent's employment as a peace officer was a substantial, contributing cause of his death, that the standard for compensation under the peace officers benefit fund was the same as under Minn. Stat. ch. 176, and, finally, that the spouse was entitled to an award. The court found that the WCCA erred in its decision because a claim against the fund could have been paid only if the decedent was a peace officer killed in the line of duty under Minn. Stat. &sect; 352E.04 (1980). The WCCA ruled that the workers' compensation standard for liability applied, namely, whether the decedent's death arose out of and in the course of employment. The WCCA reasoned that &quot;killed in the line of duty&quot; was only a test for certification, not for claims liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator-respondent employee and respondent-relator each sought review of a decision of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals (Minnesota), which affirmed the compensation judge's determination that the employee had sustained a disabling injury and was entitled to benefits during retaining, that the employer could recover its overpayment of his compensation, and that the compensation was to be adjusted on the anniversary of the injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that he did not receive excessive compensation during retraining and, if he did, the employer could not unilaterally reduce his weekly temporary total disability benefits in order to recover the overpayment. The employer claimed that that application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.645 (1984) to employees who were injured prior to its effective date impaired its vested right to adjust benefits on October 1 of each year. On appeal, the court affirmed that part of the appellate court's order that had determined that the employee had received excessive compensation, finding that under Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.102, subd. 11 (1980) he was entitled to temporary total disability benefits but not retraining compensation. The court also ruled that the employer could recover those excessive benefits under Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.179 (1984) because it had paid them voluntarily and mistakenly. The court reversed that part of the appellate court's decision that had required the employer to adjust disability benefits on the anniversary date of his injury, holding that the 1980 version of Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.645 rather than the 1984 amendment governed the adjustment date of the employee's benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's ruling that the employer had made an overpayment, that the employer could apply a portion of the employee's award for partial disability against the overpayment, and that the employer could deduct from the employee's weekly benefits the entire overpayment. The court reversed that part of the appellate court's ruling that had required the employer to adjust the disability benefit on the anniversary date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An audit of the taxpayer's returns showed that the taxpayer deviated from the commissioner's computation schedules for calculating its excise tax liability. By its amended returns, the taxpayer sought to exclude railroad operating income, upon which its gross earnings tax was computed, from its net taxable income, upon which its excise tax was based. The commissioner denied the taxpayer's claims for refunds by the same notice that assessed additional excise taxes. The tax court affirmed the commissioner's order. On appeal, the court affirmed the order. The court found that the commissioner properly assessed additional tax and interest against the taxpayer. The court stated that the application of the three-factor allocation formula prescribed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.19(1)(2)(a) (1982) did not constitute an abuse of discretion by the tax court. The court stated that because imposition of both gross earnings and excise tax was contrary to neither the statute nor federal or state constitutional requirements, the court affirmed the tax court's order affirming the commissioner's denial of the taxpayer's refund claim.</SPAN></P>

It was not part of the employee's job to be sitting or lying on the machine. Two blood samples taken at the hospital indicated that the employee's blood alcohol level at that time was between .267% and .300%. The court affirmed the denial of benefits, finding that sufficient evidence supported the decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured drove over a bent metal signpost, which pierced her car and struck her. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of the municipality pursuant to the municipal immunity section of Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.03 because the injured had workers' compensation insurance. The injured sought review, contending that the provision unconstitutionally discriminated against victims of municipal torts who received workers' compensation benefits. On review, the court agreed and reversed the judgment of the lower court. The court found that the statute, while arguably advancing the identified purposes, made an arbitrary distinction. According to the court, the classification created by &sect; 466.03, subd. 2, distinguished victims of municipal tortfeasors who received workers' compensation benefits from all other victims of municipal tortfeasors. The court held that the classification was based solely upon the source of the victim's insurance benefits and that this distinction bore no rational relation to either of the proffered objectives of the statute. The court held that the statute violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions and was therefore void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tavern was located near a former school building which had been closed several years earlier. A nearby landowner who claimed that the tavern reduced the value of his property was elected to the town board, and after a public technical institute opened in the formerly-abandoned school building, the board by a two-to-one vote, the landowner being part of the majority, refused to renew the license on the basis that the tavern violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.14(3) (7) (1984), which provided that liquor could not be sold within 1,500 feet of a school. The trial and appellate courts based their respective rulings upon the question of whether the statute was technically offended, but on appeal, the court bypassed that question and held that the tavern was protected by the grandfather clause in Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.14(3)(9) (1984). Because no school, but merely an abandoned school building, existed at the time the bar obtained its license, the opening of the school did not bar operation of the tavern. Furthermore, the court found the landowner's participation in the town board vote to have been improper, in that he had a direct, substantial, and flagrant conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, which upheld the town board's denial of the liquor license renewal, and held that the tavern was eligible to hold a liquor license. The court further held that the landowner was ineligible to vote on further license renewals, and remanded the case to the district court with instructions that it order the town board and the county board to renew the liquor license.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the mother sought an order permitting her and the child to relocate in Colorado, where she claimed to have been promised employment. The father responded by moving for a change of custody. The trial court ordered that the mother should have sole legal and physical custody of child subject to reasonable visitation by the father, but denied the mother's request to remove the child from Minnesota. The appellate court held that the father was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. On appeal, the court found that the father had notice of the paternity action and participated in the action to the extent he wished.

The legislature clearly expressed its intent that arrested drivers not be given that right. The court rejected the driver's argument that her Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, sought to enjoin the employment practices of appellants, health club and its owners. The hearing examiner held that the practices were in violation the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Act), Minn. Stat. &sect; 363 (1983), and denied certain class certification. The parties sought review in the Minnesota Court of Appeals. The court granted accelerated review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were born-again Christians who used their religious beliefs as a method of employee management. They asserted that their practices were proper and lawful exercises of their constitutional rights. The court chose to grant discretionary review because the interest of justice required immediate review of liability determinations before the issue of damages had been litigated. The court concluded that the club had standing to assert its constitutional arguments because the hearing examiner pierced the corporate veil to make the owner's liable for the illegal actions of the club. By so doing, the owners, in reality, were the ones asserting their constitutional rights. The Act was facially-neutral legislation. Therefore, the court followed a three-step analysis to determine whether a constitutional exemption was required. The court held that (1) the requirements of the Act did impose a burden upon the owner's free exercise of religion; (2) the burden was justified by the state's compelling interest in prohibiting discrimination in employment; and (3) the Act was the least restrictive means to achieve the state's goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied parties motions to dismiss the appeals. The court affirmed the hearing examiner's rulings that the alleged violations of the Act were proved by substantial evidence, but reversed and remanded the order, which refused class certification. The court held that the owners were properly dismissed from the action because when the corporate veil was pierced the legal basis for the aiding and abetting claim became nonexistent.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.185(2) (1984), and second-degree murder for causing unintentional death during a burglary in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.19(2) (1984).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers arrested defendant without a warrant on the basis of an informant's tip. He was convicted of two murders, one first-degree and one second-degree. Defendant claimed his warrantless arrest was without probable cause and that after his arrest, notwithstanding his request that the police stop questioning him, he was denied access to an attorney. Additionally, defendant claimed insufficient evidence, that he was denied his constitutional right to confront a key state's witness, and that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that it agreed with the omnibus court's finding that defendant was advised of his Miranda rights at the time of his arrest and again at the police station; that defendant did not ask to speak with a lawyer or refuse to talk with the officers; and that his confession was voluntary. The court concluded that defendant had a right of confrontation but waived it, that there was no merit to defendant's selective and oversubtle reading of the trial court's jury instruction, and that there was sufficient evidence to sustain his first-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union represented teachers, but not administrators, and under its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the district, seniority was calculated using only the years of service within the bargaining unit, while &sect; 125.17, subd. 11 gave seniority for all the years in service in the district. When school enrollment declined, the district terminated 180 teachers according to seniority, but most of the administrators to be removed were given jobs that belonged to six other teachers rather than being laid off. On review, the court found that all the administrators fit the &sect; 125.17, subd. 11 definition of &quot;teacher,&quot; but not the definition under Minn. Stat. &sect; 179.63 (Supp. 1973), which allowed procedures for termination under a CBA besides those in Minn. Stat. &sect; 125.17, subd. 11.

Stat. &sect; 257.62, subd. 5 (1984) violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal constitution. In reversing, the court determined that there was no discrimination based on gender in violation of the equal protection clause because there was no classification based on gender. The statute provided that alleged fathers were to pay temporary child support pursuant to the same statutory provisions that pertained to mothers. Additionally, the statute did not treat &quot;unmarried alleged fathers&quot; in the same way it treated &quot;married established fathers&quot; because money paid by established fathers went directly to the support of his child, while money paid by the alleged fathers was paid into court and was refundable if paternity was not later established. The court noted that temporary supported was ordered under the statute only if the blood test results indicated a very high likelihood of paternity and that the validity of the blood test was not seriously questioned. The three-factor balancing test for determining what process was constitutionally due was satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relief association represented certain active firemen and also administered pension benefits to retired firemen. In an effort to phase out relief associations, the state required all firemen hired after June 15 1980 to be covered under the state retirement system. To ease the transition, Minn. Stat. &sect; 423A.01(3) (1982) allowed communities to provide additional benefits to retiring firemen within certain restrictions. Pursuant to &sect; 423A.01(3), the city passed a resolution authorizing additional benefits for firemen employed on or retiring after July 15, 1980. A few months later the city amended the resolution to extend the additional benefits to retired firemen. The amendment required a reduction in benefits for active firemen. The relief association filed a declaratory judgment action to contest the amendment. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of the city and found that a statute passed after the city's resolution barring such amendments did not operate retroactively to bar the resolution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the court's decision allowing stacking was to be retroactively applied. The insured was injured in an automobile accident.

Five days later, the insured demanded that the insurer bring the total amount of her income-loss benefits up to 85 percent of her gross weekly income. The insurer refused. In affirming the decision on appeal, the court found that the decision did not overrule clear past precedent, nor was it a case of first impression so that the insurer would have relied on anything other than its own interpretation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.44(3). There was no unconstitutional taking of property in violation of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's claim for a total permanent disability was administratively denied because the compensation judge found that his work as an apartment caretaker gave him substantial compensation. During the pendency of his appeal to the WCCA, the Workers' Compensation Act was amended to provide a different standard of judicial review. The employee contended that the new appellate review standards may not be applied retroactively to his case. He also argued that even if the new standards were applied, the WCCA erred in deciding that he did not have a total permanent disability. The court reversed the WCCA's decision. The court held that (1) the 1983 appellate review provisions were applicable to the employee's case and to all cases pending on July 1, 1983, and (2) the compensation judge's findings that the employee was steadily employed at a job giving him substantial compensation were manifestly contrary to the evidence. The court found that the employee's monthly compensation as a caretaker was misleading because it was dependent on his wife performing most of the caretaking work. The misjudgment was in crediting the employee with his spouse's labor and earnings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver alleged that the negligent design, construction, and maintenance of a county road contributed to the damages she sustained. The state claims act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 5 (1982), did not contain the following language that was found in Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.05, subd. 1 (1982), the municipal statute: &quot;No action therefor shall be maintained unless such notice has been given and unless the action is commenced within one year after such notice.&quot; The omission of this language in the state tort claims act previously had led to the conclusion that failure to give notice was not grounds for dismissal of an action against the state. The statutes created an unreasonable distinction between victims of state and municipal torts. The court could discern no rational basis for distinguishing between municipal and state tortfeasors. Thus, the language of &sect; 466.05 precluding the bringing of an action unless notice was given pursuant to the statute was stricken as violative of the equal protection guarantees contained in Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A private citizen issued a complaint against a judge that accused him of abuse of alcohol and sexual misconduct. The judge asked the trial court to quash the subpoena that was issued against him by the Board of Judicial Standards under Board of Judicial Standards R. 6(1)(c). Pursuant to the board's request, the court issued a writ of prohibition that prevented the trial court from quashing the subpoena regarding the alcohol-related allegation but permitted a writ of prohibition to issue regarding the allegation of sexual misconduct. Generally, an investigative subpoena was enforced if the investigation was within the board's jurisdiction, the subpoena was specific, the investigation was for a proper purpose, and use of the subpoena power was reasonable. Under R. 6(a)(1), the board was authorized to investigate a judge on any reasonable basis. The court held that the board was authorized to issue subpoenas but noted that judges enjoyed a constitutional right of privacy that extended to sexual matters. To intrude on a judge's right of privacy, the board was required to show that an important public interest was at stake, which it had not done.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 690.3641 (1982). She contended that the statute was so vague that it violated Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend.

Stat. &sect; 609.3641, subd. 1(2)(e) (1982), for commission of sexual acts with her son and daughter that occurred on or about a particular date and continued over an extended period of time. Later, she was charged for the acts that occurred on a single day. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 609.3641, subd. 1(2)(e) was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate her right to be informed of the specific charges against her. When the entire statute was considered, it was not vague. It clearly defined the type of conduct prohibited, detailed the kind of sexual contact made criminal, and specified the persons with whom such contact was prohibited. The statute gave defendant adequate warning that sexual abuse of her children was a criminal offense. A particular time period was not a material element of the offense because the act was unlawful whenever it occurred. Although the complaint should have stated the specific time period in which the acts occurred, defendant was not prejudiced by that failure because she learned the dates in question through discovery. The court rejected her other contentions of error.</SPAN></P>

The Tax Court found for the taxpayers and lowered their assessments.

The court concluded that the Tax Court acted properly in taking judicial notice as specified. The court also found that the evidence as a whole supported the Tax Court's determination that assessments imposed on the taxpayers were unequal. The court rejected the county's challenges to the Tax Court's determinations based on use of the sales ratio studies. The court made a detailed valuation based on the studies, leading to the conclusion that the taxpayers met the burden imposed on them to show that the assessments were unequal. The court noted that the use of the disputed ratios was only to present a prima facie case, which was subject to rebuttal. Thus, any party could introduce any evidence disputing the studies, but none was provided to warrant reversal of the Tax Court's determination of unequal assessments.</SPAN></P>

The WCCA did not err when it concluded that the award was not reasonable, fair, and in conformity with Minn. Stat. ch. 176 (1982). The court reviewed the statutory and case law backdrop for Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from District Court, McLeod County (Minnesota), which convicted him of two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress incriminating statements made to a deputy after mental health center personnel, as required by the Child Abuse Reporting Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.556, reported defendant's revelations that he had sexually abused a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During therapy, defendant revealed that he had sexually abused a child while babysitting her. Mental health center personnel reported the abuse. Based upon the report, a deputy interviewed defendant, who, after being Mirandized, gave voluntary statements admitting several sexual incidents, which were corroborated. Defendant argued that the evidence should have been suppressed because it was derived from information provided by health care center personnel in violation of his physician-patient privilege or right to privacy. Affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that the evidence was properly received because information sheltered by the statutory medical privilege, Minn. Stat. &sect; 505.02(4), (7) (1982), lost its privileged status to the extent that the Child Abuse Reporting Act authorized its disclosure and Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.556, subd. 2 (1982) authorized disclosure of defendant's identity as a person responsible for the child's care.
