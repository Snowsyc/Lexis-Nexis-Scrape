</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of securing execution of a document by deception. On appeal, the court reversed the judgement for a determination of whether appellant had notice of the acts or omissions of which he was charged. Appellee state sought review by the appellate court, which remanded the case for review in light of new caselaw that held that an appellant who challenged the sufficiency of the charging instrument had to show harm that was apparent in the statement of facts. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court concluded that while the complete statement of facts was missing, appellant had adequate notice of its absence, and his failure to object to the completed record for appeal by the clerk of the court demonstrated that he had not been harmed. The court held that appellant had waived his claim of a notice defect of the indictment because he failed to raise the issue in a timely fashion, and that the indictment's charge of the offense was sufficient enough to confer jurisdiction on the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant skating rink owner sought review of the judgment of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which denied appellant relief in his action contesting the constitutionality of Dallas, Tex., City Code &sect;&sect; 14-8.1, 14-5 (d), which applied age-limit restrictions to appellant's dance hall operations, but not his roller skating operations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a skating rink owner, brought an action to contest the constitutionality of Dallas, Tex., City Code &sect;&sect; 14-8.1, 14-5 (d), which placed age and hour restrictions on the operation of dance halls expressly catering to a juvenile clientele. The city ordinance restricted the operation of the dance hall, but not the roller rink appellant also operated on the premises. The lower court denied appellant relief. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the lower court and enjoined the enforcement of Dallas, Tex., City Code &sect; 14-8.1, the ordinance that placed an age limit on patrons, but affirmed the part of the judgment that found constitutional the restrictions of &sect; 14-5 (d) on the hours of operation. The court held that &sect; 14-8.1 was unconstitutional because minors had the right to freely associate under U.S. Const. amend. I, and the ordinance was overly broad in its attempt to protect minors from unsuitable influences. Section 14-5 (d), which restricted the hours of operation, was constitutional because the city provided a rational relationship between the ordinance and the legitimate public purpose it served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury convicted him of burglary of a building with intent to commit theft, enhanced by two prior felony convictions, appellant sought review. Appellant contended that the state failed to prove all the elements of burglary because the owner of the building died before the trial and that the indictment failed to specifically allege the elements of an enhancement offense. The court affirmed. The court held that Texas law permitted proof by circumstantial evidence to show lack of the owner's consent to a burglary. The court held that appellant waived any objection to a jury charge during the punishment stage of the trial because he failed to object at trial. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.19 (1981). The court held that the state's indictment provided appellant with sufficient notice that he was charged with having been twice convicted of prior felonies. Tex. Penal Code &sect; 12.42(d) (1987). The court held that the state was not required to allege enhancement counts in an indictment with the same degree of specificity that the primary offense required. The court rejected appellant's speedy trial claim because the statute on which he relied had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(4) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of delivery of hydromorphone. The court reversed that conviction on appeal, finding that a failure to give the parole charge under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(4) (1987) was reversible error. The court also remanded the case. The court determined that art. 37.07(4)'s provision that the court shall charge the jury mandated that its charge be given, and that a reversal was required because appellant objected to the omission in the charge. The court also concluded that it was obvious that the error caused appellant some actual harm, and that the state did not meet its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was not harmful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction for delivery of hydromorphone, holding that a failure to give a mandatory statutory parole charge was a reversible error, and remanded the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Appellant was convicted for possession of and delivery of marihuana, and sentenced to 15 years' confinement; appellant sought review on four points of error. On review, the court held that The Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (1987), was held unconstitutional and did not provide relief for appellant. The court held that appellant's point that a memorandum was not prepared by the grand jury prior to the indictment and signed by the foreman was not a ground for vacating the decision. The court also held that pretrial motions were subject to effective review and were properly preserved such that appellant's argument that his guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently entered was invalid. The court further held that appellant's trial counsel provided effective assistance and any alleged ineffectiveness would not have changed the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the 89th District Court of Wichita County (Texas) for the offense of aggravated robbery pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.03(a) (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming defendant's conviction for aggravated robbery, the court found that his right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI was not violated because he and his counsel were to blame for any delays in bringing him to trial. The court did not find any showing that any delay prejudiced his defense. The court found that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4, which authorized and directed jury instructions on the law of parole, was constitutional and that jurors were not likely to disregard the trial court's instruction not to consider how the parole law might be applied to him. The court applied a five-prong test for determining whether jury misconduct constituted reversible error and found that defendant failed to meet three of the five prongs. Issues of fact involving jury misconduct were for the trial court to decide and the trial court had the discretion to grant or deny his motion for a new trial on that basis. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the evidence of jury misconduct conflicted and defendant failed to meet the five-prong test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery because he was not denied a speedy trial, as the delays were his fault and there was no showing that any delays prejudiced his defense. The jury instructions on the law of parole were proper, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial for jury misconduct because the evidence conflicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction of attempted murder. He contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial because the state improperly characterized him as a &quot;murderer&quot; during final argument. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. It held that although the evidence supported an argument that the appellant attempted to murder the complainant and that he thought he had murdered her, the evidence did not show that the appellant was a murderer. The court held that the prosecutor's statement was improper because one cannot be characterized as a murderer until he had legally committed a murder. The court concluded that the prosecutor's remark was not so inflammatory that its prejudicial effect could not have been removed by the instruction given to the jury to disregard the statement. The court held that no reversible error was shown. The court determined that appellant had waived the constitutional error in a Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for robbery because it found there was sufficient testimony to prove venue by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found the testimony from the complainant and the off-duty police officer about the location of the robbery was sufficient to prove the county in which the incident occurred. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant had committed the robbery. The court found that the complainant had positively identified defendant at the time of the arrest and at trial, and in addition, the court found that defendant admitted that he was present at the scene and had taken complainant's purse. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant intended to obtain and maintain control of complainant's purse and its contents without her effective consent. The court held that the evidence was also sufficient to show that defendant had intentionally or knowingly caused bodily injury to the complainant by hitting her while committing the theft. The court held that a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Appellant entered a plea of not guilty, but a jury found him guilty and assessed punishment at seven years confinement in the state department of corrections.

Appellant failed to object at the first opportunity under Tex. R. App. P. 52(a) to the fact that the state read the second paragraph of the indictment to the jury at the punishment phase of trial when the jury had only found him guilty of the charges alleged in the first paragraph of the indictment, as such he preserved nothing for review and he received the relief requested and the instruction to disregard cured any error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possessing, with intent to deliver, a powdery substance that weighed a total of 1331.09 grams, of which only 349.51 was pure cocaine. Defendant was sentenced to 30 year's confinement under the Texas Controlled Substance, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 4.039(d)(3), for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance with an aggregate weight, including any adulterants of dilutants, of 400 grams or more. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Tex. Penal Code &sect; 4.03(d)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague where a person of ordinary intelligence could reasonably ascertain the plain meaning of the words &quot;adulterant&quot; or &quot;dilutants.&quot; The court also found that the statute did not violate constitutional due process and equal protection requirements where the legislature had a rational basis for concluding that possession of greater amounts of controlled substances should be punished more severely. The court held statements made by defendant after he was arrested were admissible res gestae statements where eight police officers had burst into a hotel room defendant was in and defendant made the statements within minutes after the police arrived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 122nd District Court of Galveston County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated sexual assault after a jury trial. The jury made a affirmative finding that appellant used a deadly weapon and assessed punishment at 10 years' confinement. Appellant presented nine points of error, including a challenge to the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault using a deadly weapon. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of jury instructions. At the punishment phase, the trial court gave the jury an instruction that tracked verbatim Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1986), which merely advised the jury regarding certain parole statutes. The court rejected appellant's arguments that article 37.07, &sect; 4 violated the separation of powers doctrine, that the statute unconstitutionally invited jurors to speculate on matters outside of punishment, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and confusing, that the jury charge denied him due process of law, and that the statute was vague and ambiguous in application because of drafting errors. The court held that the instruction simply clarified the law as to the effect of parole and good time credits on the sentence, matters about which jurors tend to speculate. However, the court agreed that the judgment was mistaken in stating that the court found that appellant had used a deadly weapon, when in fact the jury made the finding. The court reformed the judgment accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of aggravated sexual assault, but reformed it to reflect that the jury, rather than the judge, made the finding that appellant used a deadly weapon. The court concluded that the statute in question and the related jury charge were not unduly vague, and did not invite juror speculation as a matter of law. The court held that the challenged statute and associated jury charge were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 228th District Court of Harris County (Texas) for robbery, alleging that the lower court erred in denying a motion for continuance, in permitting state's jury arguments, and in admitting a line-up photograph in which appellant appears in jail clothes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of robbery and sought review on the grounds that the lower court improperly denied his motion for a continuance to obtain tape recordings of statements made by complainant, allowed state to make impermissible jury arguments on appellant's failure to testify, and admitted a line-up photo of appellant in which he appears in jail attire. The court held that denial of appellant's request for continuance was proper because appellant's request was based solely to obtain merely impeachment or cumulative evidence and the complainant had already admitted to testifying differently at appellant's parole hearing. The court also held that state's use of &quot;I&quot; in jury arguments was not a comment on the failure of appellant to testify, but a discussion of defensive theories in the case, and a fair summation of the evidence offered at trial, and the effect on the jury, if any, was cured by prompt and clear instruction. Finally, the court held that the line-up photo was excised to eliminate any visible words or numbers printed on any of the pictures, showing the appellant from his chest up, and made it virtually impossible to identify appellant therein as a prisoner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for robbery was affirmed on the grounds that appellant's motion for continuance was sought solely to obtain impeachment evidence on an issue already admitted, that state's jury argument was summation of evidence and any error was cured by prompt instruction to disregard, and that proper steps were taken to eliminate effects of appellant's admitted line-up photo.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the conviction and remanded for an entry of acquittal because the hearsay testimony of the nurse was contradicted by the victim, and was not corroborated by any other evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant waste management company obtained a permit to build and operate a hazardous-waste disposal well from appellant, the Texas Water Commission. Appellees, a citizens action committee and Brazoria County, filed for judicial review under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4477-7 &sect; 9. The trial court ruled that the order in dispute was not a full and final order, and that the findings of fact were inadequate to support the order. The court held that the statute authorizing judicial review had to be interpreted in light of the judicial doctrines of finality and ripeness. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that appellant commission's order was not a final order for purposes of judicial review because the order allowed appellant waste management company the option to give some type or kind of financial assurance in the future rather than a bond in designated sums as required by statute. The court determined that it was insufficient for the agency merely to fix the amount of financial assurance to be supplied by the permittee in the future, because the statute required that a bond be executed or alternate form of assurance be given before any permit was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the governing statute required the execution of a bond before a permit was issued to appellant waste management company by appellant Texas Water Commission. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court issued in favor of appellees, a citizens action committee and Brazoria County, in part. The court vacated the remand portion of the order because the matter was not final and therefore still before appellant commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county filed a lawsuit to collect delinquent ad valorem taxes owed by appellant landowner. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the notice requirements of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7174A, &sect; 4 did not conflict with Tex. Const. Art. VIII, &sect; 1-d-1. Article 7174A, &sect; 4 required a person seeking agriculture use designation and assessment of land based on it productive capacity to file an application with the tax assessor. Appellant's failure to file an application made his land ineligible for such assessment. Article 7174A, &sect; 4 required the tax assessor to mail an application form to each person that owned land that qualified under article 7174A in the preceding year. The court held appellee did not fail to comply with the notice requirements because appellant failed to file a proper application the preceding year. The court held that there was no evidence that appellee was aware that appellant's property qualified. The court held that appellee provided proper notice of the reappraisal of appellant's land pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 7255c when it deposited the notice in the mail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the 75th District Court of Liberty County (Texas), which entered a judgment convicting him in a juried proceeding of the delivery of cocaine in the aggregate amount exceeding 400 grams, and fixing a punishment of 20 years confinement and a $ 20,000 fine. Appellant claimed the defenses of entrapment and mistake of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the trial court's judgment convicting him of delivery of cocaine in the aggregate of 400 grams despite his claimed defenses of mistake of fact and entrapment, contending that there was insufficient evidence to prove he delivered over 400 grams of cocaine by constructively transferring the same, and that the trial court erred in allowing an undercover informant to testify over appellant's objections to hearsay statements he allegedly made. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the evidence was sufficient to prove appellant constructively transferred cocaine to a special Drug Enforcement Agent pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 1.02(6) (1987), by leaving it in an airplane so that the agent could take physical possession of the drugs. The court further held that the hearsay testimony concerning who made the initial move or the first telephone call for purposes of appellant's entrapment defense had already been elicited by appellant during his cross-examination of the agent, and therefore he waived his hearsay objection to this evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 284th District Court, Montgomery County (Texas), which entered his jury conviction on two counts of attempted capital murder, with findings of true on three sentencing enhancements.

Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in permitting the jury to enter dual sentences on convictions arising out of one incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury on two counts of attempted capital murder, in violation of Tex.

Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences, alleging, inter alia, that the trial court committed error in entering sentences on both convictions that stemmed from one incident. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all respects, finding that defendant's failure to object to the sentencing at trial constituted a waiver of any error because an error was not permitted to be raised for the first time on appeal. The court also found that the two offenses did not arise out of the same transaction, because there were two different people shot and two different robberies.</SPAN></P>

She filed a pretrial application to be released from the charge on the ground that the statute was void for vagueness in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. Appellant argued that because the legislature did not define the terms &quot;remove&quot; and &quot;invasive techniques,&quot; these terms failed to give fair notice of the conduct forbidden. Her application was denied. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the language was sufficiently clear to put persons of ordinary intelligence, particularly lay midwives who possess special knowledge and training, on notice of the acts prohibited. The court held that the language simply stated that a lay midwife should not move the placenta from its position or take it from the body by any procedure which involved an entry into the body.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held that appellant breached its contract in using the 60 hour computation formula. Appellant challenged this ruling, contending that the judgment effectively required appellant to pay more than what was due under the contract without receipt of additional consideration and was a second contract that contravened Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 53. The court reversed the lower court's order, concluding that the there was no express or implied contract created by the memos and documents referring to retirement benefits that were presented into evidence. Moreover, the judgment required that appellant pay benefits above what appellees were paid under a valid contract without receipt of additional consideration, which violated the constitutional limits on appellant's authority to contract because there was no approval by the city council of such a contract.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.03(d)(3) (Supp. 1987). Appellant challenged his conviction in ten points of error. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that convicted appellant because the charging instrument gave sufficient notice of which method of manufacture was attempted under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.03(a) (Supp. 1987). The court reasoned that the terms &quot;manufacture&quot; and &quot;synthesis&quot; referred to manufacture by production and that the charging instrument sufficiently alleged production. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to link appellant to the manufacturing process and hold him criminally responsible because appellant signed the lease for the site of the methamphetamine manufacturing, applied for electrical services, and occupied the premises. The court sustained appellant's point of error that challenged the lower court's refusal to hear an amended motion to quash once the trial had begun, but determined the error did not result in harm to appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer appealed from the order of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), dismissing, for want of jurisdiction, an action alleging that defendant city employer's failure to follow regulations regarding the transfer of officers, deprived him of property and liberty interests, and violating his rights to due process, equal protection, and nonimpairment of contract under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer applied for a transfer, but when vacancies arose in the desired section, his request was denied due to an alleged hearing disability. In filling one of the vacancies, defendant city employer failed to follow established transfer regulations. Plaintiff then sued for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that defendant's decision denied him due process and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and impaired his employment contract, in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The complaint was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and plaintiff appealed. In affirming, the court agreed that the pleadings failed to state a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the trial court. The transfer regulations did not vest in plaintiff any due process property right to a transfer and his expectancy of a transfer did not rise to the level of a protected vested property interest. Even if his reputation was damaged by the denial of a transfer, his reputation was not a protected liberty interest. Defendant had not created any discriminatory classifications and the employment contract was not impaired by the regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal order was affirmed because plaintiff failed to establish the jurisdiction of the trial court; he had no vested property interest under the regulations in obtaining a transfer, the expectancy of a transfer did not create a property interest, his reputation was not a protected liberty interest, the regulations did not create any discriminatory classifications, and the regulations themselves did not impair his employment contract.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 911b (1964 &amp; Supp. 1987). On review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that appellant was required to establish two particular elements that were determinative of its contentions on appeal. First, appellant had to establish that the entirety of its carriage of materials was merely incidental to a business other than the transportation business. Second, with particular reference to appellant's carriage of materials purchased by it from other suppliers, with their contemporaneous re-sale to others, appellant was obliged to establish that its acquisition of title was in good faith.

Appellant petitioned appellee to amend its rule defining &quot;local exchange service&quot; to make it plain that the &quot;switching systems&quot; amounted to a &quot;local exchange service.&quot; Appellee determined that it would not amend its rules as appellant requested. Appellant filed suit in district court alleging that the unregulated activities injured its revenues, investments, and rights conferred by its certificates. The trial court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Appellant sought review challenging the jurisdictional issue on various alternative grounds. Appellant contended that the court had jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA). The court affirmed the dismissal.

Further, there was proof that appellees accounted for the economic, social, and environmental costs involved as required by Tex. Agric. Code Ann. &sect; 76.104(c).

The district court held that because the divorce judgment did not dispose of the retirement benefits, the court was empowered to partition those benefits. Appellant maintained that the divorce judgment had the effect of dividing all of the property and was therefore res judicata as to any subsequent partition suit. Appellant claimed that the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA) violated the separation of powers doctrine and was an unconstitutional impairment of his vested rights. The court affirmed, holding that appellant never acquired a vested, permanent right to his retirement benefits before congress enacted the USFSPA. By passage of the USFSPA, Congress did not retroactively alter appellant's established rights; instead, it lawfully exercised its plenary power to modify the privileges and duties conferred by the benefit scheme. As such, the separation of powers doctrine was not violated, nor was the USFSPA retroactively applied in violation of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant learned of the garnishment action when he attempted to draw on funds subject to the garnishment. The district court overruled appellant's motion for new trial, which alleged a failure to receive notice as provided in rule 663a. Appellee asserted that because appellant received actual notice of the garnishment, the notice requirements of rule 663a were met. The court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that rule 663a was unambiguous and that the debtor must be served.

Appellant argued (1) that the punishment assessed, 50 years of confinement and a $ 250,000 fine, was cruel and unusual; (2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel; and (3) that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion for mistrial after the prosecutor injected harmful, unsworn testimony before the jury. The court found that where, as here, the punishment assessed was within the range of punishment prescribed by statute, the punishment was not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. The court also found that appellant had failed to demonstrate that his counsel's performance was deficient and that the outcome would have been different had counsel's representation not been deficient. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for mistrial finding that, considering the evidence adduced at trial, the argument was not so prejudicial as to be incurable by an instruction, had one been requested and that, error, if any, was waived.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also asserted that the trial court erred in submitting an instruction to the jury regarding his failure to testify.

Appellant later moved to dismiss other charges pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 32A.02 (Supp. 1986) (the &quot;Speedy Trial Act&quot;). The trial court granted appellant's motion to dismiss. Appellant then filed a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the dismissal of the charges based on the state's violation of the Speedy Trial Act was a bar to further prosecution under the instant indictment. The trial court denied habeas corpus relief. Appellant sought review of that order arguing that the trial court erred in denying his application for writ of habeas corpus because Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 28.061 (1986) requires a mandatory dismissal of any remaining charges, which arose from the same transaction, when one charge has been dismissed pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 32A.02 (1986). The court noted that recently the Court of Criminal Appeals held the Speedy Trial Act unconstitutional and its enacting statutes void. The court concluded that because appellant's point of error was based on a void statute it must be overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision from the 25th District Court of Colorado County (Texas), which convicted him of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argued his oral confession should have been suppressed. The court ruled that appellant's statement, given at the time he was placed under arrest was voluntarily given. There was no evidence of coercion and it was not in response to a police inquiry. Although his I.Q. was within the dull/normal range, he had sufficient capacity to understand the Miranda warnings. Thus, both the oral confession and the written confession, made after he had been given the warnings, were admissible. Appellant argued he had ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found the omissions alleged by appellant were not of such nature as would affect the evidence of guilt. Because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, appellant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the alleged deficient performance, as required for a reversal. The copious evidence of guilt and the circumstances of the offense negated any reasonable possibility that inadmissible evidence contributed to either the conviction or punishment. The court found no error in the jury instruction on the parole law, and it affirmed the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision which convicted appellant of murder because his confessions were given voluntarily and were properly admitted and the over whelming evidence negated reasonable possibility that any errors by his counsel or in the admission of evidence prejudiced him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. 4590i (Supp. 1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was injured and was referred to appellee physician, who recommended surgery in spite of decedent's history of cardiac problems. After the surgery, decedent had difficulties. Appellant, decedent's wife, questioned appellee regularly about decedent's condition and was reassured that decedent was in no danger. On January 2, 1979, a cardiologist examined decedent. He was in his eighth day of congestive heart failure and suffered two cardiac arrests. Subsequently, decedent's health remained poor, and he died of a cardiac arrest in 1983. In September 1985, appellant filed a claim against appellee. Appellee sought summary judgment based on a limitations defense pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. 4590i (Supp. 1987). The trial court granted the motion, and appellant challenged the judgment. The court affirmed, finding that appellant's proof was insufficient to raise a fact issue as to fraudulent concealment. The court held that the estoppel effect of fraudulent concealment on the limitation period ended when appellant learned of facts that would have caused a reasonable person to make an inquiry, which, if pursued, would have led to discovery of a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the proof was insufficient to raise a fact issue as to fraudulent concealment, and fraudulent concealment tolled the statute of limitations only until appellant, decedent's wife, learned of the right of action or should have learned thereof through the exercise of reasonable diligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from a District Court of Dallas County (Texas), in which she was convicted of arson and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Appellant asserted that insufficient evidence existed to connect her to the fire, that appellee state improperly relied upon an inference based on an inference to prove arson, and that appellee failed to prove that the manner and means of starting the fire were unknown to the grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that in the instant circumstantial evidence case, sufficient evidence showed that appellant committed an offense under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 28.02(a)(6) (Supp. 1987). The court noted that the only reasonable hypothesis to be drawn from the evidence, albeit circumstantial, was that appellant intentionally and unconcernedly started the fire which consumed her home and which took four lives. The court further noted that the existence of evidence showing that the fire was of incendiary nature, in addition to evidence of motive and opportunity, permitted the jury to find the essential elements of arson. The court then rejected the assertion that appellee state's case improperly relied upon an inference based upon an inference, noting that testimony, and not inference, established that at the time of the fire inflammable agents were used in the habitation and in that portion of it where the fire originated. The court affirmed, concluding that appellee successfully proved that the grand jury, after efforts to do so, was unable to find out the exact starting cause of the fire and that no fundamental error was shown in the remaining points of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that sufficient evidence existed for a rational trier of have to conclude that appellant intentionally set fire to her home with the intent to damage or to destroy the property. Appellee state did not impermissibly ground its case on an inference based on an inference where it was testimony, and not an inference, that showed the use of inflammable agents in the home at the time of the fire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for jumping bail, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 38.11 (1974), in a district court of Hunt County (Texas) after a trial before the court. Appellant argued that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction when the state filed to establish prima facie proof that appellant was notified of the court in which he was to appear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was arrested, appellant was released on a bond that required him to appear instanter in a court in Hunt county, without specifying which court. Appellant did not appear for his arraignment, and was served with a copy of the indictment for the original offense 10 months after his arrest. At the trial for jumping bond, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 38.11 (1974), the state presented no evidence other than the bond to show appellant had notice that he was to appear before the 354th Judicial District Court of Hunt County. Reversing his conviction, the court noted that Tex. Penal Code &sect; 38.11(c) provided that appellant had a defense if he had a reasonable excuse for his failure to appear. The court explained that although the language in an instanter bond might have been sufficient to prove a prima facie case that an appellant had notice of the date and time of a hearing, it was not sufficient to prove a prima facie case that he had notice of the place of hearing, because no court was named.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction for jumping bond after a trial to the court, and rendered a judgment of acquittal. The court explained that the state failed to make a prima facie case that appellant knew the place for the hearing, because the instanter bond on which he was released did not specify which court would have held the hearing, and there was no other evidence of notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of delivery of a controlled substance. Appellant was sentenced to 25 years' confinement. Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence. Appellant maintained that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing the introduction of testimony regarding an extraneous offense, and that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. Appellant raised the defense of entrapment at a pretrial motion, during voir dire, and with his own testimony. Appellant's predisposition to commit the offense for which he was tried was not relevant under the objective test of entrapment. Thus, the informant's testimony that appellant had sold cocaine to an undercover police officer three days prior to the alleged offense was improperly admitted, prejudiced appellant, and constituted reversible error. The trial court, however, did not err by giving the parole eligibility charge to the jury pursuant to art. 37.07, &sect; 4. The statute did not invite the jury to consider how parole laws would affect appellant, and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the murder of her husband. On the night of the shooting, appellant was packing her belongings to move out of the house and end her marriage when her husband arrived home. There was an argument and appellant's husband beat her repeatedly and appellant shot him. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the prosecution's remarks during jury argument in the punishment phase of trial concerning appellant's pregnancy and her plea for probation were responsive pleas for law enforcement, did not inject new facts in the case, did not affect appellant's sentence, and were not so extreme or manifestly improper to constitute reversible error. The court held prosecution's remarks during voir dire that vouched for the credibility of portions of appellant's confession were not erroneous because the intervening trial and the court's admonitions and instructions in its jury charge rendered any error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held it would not address appellant's alleged error in the giving of Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the trial court should have dismissed his indictment for delivery of cocaine for violation of the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (1987), and the state and federal constitutions. The court did not rule on the statutory violation because the statute had been declared void since the time of appellant's trial. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's presumed finding that the reason for the delay in appellant's trial was the difficulty in locating him. The court affirmed because appellant was not prejudiced by the delay since the state's witnesses possessed sufficient recall to adequately testify, and appellant failed to show how his defense could possibly have been aided by the testimony of a witness he claimed was missing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction from the 180th District Court, Harris County (Texas), for aggravated sexual assault, contending that Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. &sect; 38.071(2) (1987), which allowed the use of a videotape of a child sexual assault victim, was unconstitutional because it denied his right of confrontation, and that the trial court erred in admitting the tape, where it was made after the proceedings began.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of fondling an 8-year old girl. At trial, defendant claimed that he was sleep walking, or that he was confused, believing that he was in bed next to his wife. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, and the admission of a videotape of the child's testimony. The court reviewed the trial record and found only a chain of custody objection to the use of the tape, and held that defendant had failed to preserve the issue for appeal, and had waived any objection. The court then reviewed the trial record for abuse of discretion in rejecting defendant's claim to be sleep walking or confused, and held that the trial court's rejection was within the trial court's sound discretion, and affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated sexual assault, holding that because defendant had not properly objected to the use of the videotape at trial, defendant had failed to preserve the issue for appeal. The court also held that a rational trier of facts could have found beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant possessed the requisite intent to commit the offense charged and that the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the 335th District Court of Hood County, Texas, that denied appellant's motion or a new trial after he was convicted and sentenced for aggravated sexual assault, in violation of Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated sexual assault, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1987). After a trial for sentencing, the jury assessed appellant's punishment. The appeals court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in overruling appellant's motion for a new trial, where testimony given at the hearing on the motion failed to show that any misstatement of the law was made by a juror. The evidence did not support the contention that jury misconduct denied appellant of a fair and impartial trial. The court held that the parole law, Tex Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art 37.07, &sect; 4(c) (1985), was not unconstitutionally vague and confusing. The trial court's charge in the case followed the language of the statute and the instructions clearly instructed the jury not to consider the effect that the parole law would have on appellant. Thus, the instructions were not unconstitutionally vague and the conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual assault, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011 (1987). The jury found allegations of two prior felony convictions to be true and assessed punishment. The appeals court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err when it overruled appellant's motion to set aside the indictment pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act (Act), Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 32A.02, &sect; 1(1) (1987). The court held that the Act was found to be unconstitutional for violating the separation of powers doctrine of the Texas Constitution. The trial court's failure to submit two requested charges defining &quot;force&quot; and &quot;threat of force&quot; was not in error. As the terms were not statutorily defined at the time of the trial and the terms had common and ordinary meanings that jurors could fairly be presumed to know, the trial court did not err in refusing to submit such charges.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of injury to an elderly individual by failing to obtain medical care for his mother. Appellant asserted that the indictment was defective since it failed to allege any statutory duty to act. Decedent was lying in her own urine and excrement and had a large bedsore on her heel, which had eaten away part of the heel. Bedsores on the hip and back were ulcerated and had eaten to the bone. Appellant argued that the indictment failed to allege any statutory duty to act. Texas Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.04 provided that a person committed an offense if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, by act or omission, engaged in conduct that caused seriously bodily injury to an individual who was 65 years of age or older. A statutory duty to act was required. Such duty and its omission must be alleged in the indictment and proved. Therefore, the court found that since the state had not alleged a statutory duty to act in the indictment, the indictment was fundamentally defective and the conviction void.</SPAN></P>

In support of its ruling, the court held that a jury charge on the law of self-defense was not required as there was a total lack of evidence on whether appellant reasonably believed force was immediately necessary to protect himself, a reasonable person would not have retreated, or appellant reasonably believed deadly force was immediately necessary to protect himself.

</DIV>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-1(b) (Supp. 1987). The court affirmed the trial court judgment, and appellant filed a petition for discretionary review in the court of criminal appeals, which remanded the case for further review noting that all authorities cited by the court in its original opinion were decided prior to the passage of the present DWI law, &sect; art. 67011-1(b)(1987), which prohibited drunk driving in a &quot;public place&quot; rather than upon a &quot;public road or highway or street or alley, as was required under prior law, 1979 Tex. Gen. Laws 1608. The court again affirmed the trial court judgment denying the motion to quash concluding that the indictment contained sufficient specificity to meet the required burden of notifying appellant of the particular offense charged and to bar subsequent prosecutions for the offense. The court held that appellant did not present evidence to support the motion to quash or file a motion for new trial, and pled guilty, thereby admitting she was intoxicated in a public place.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment denying appellant's motion to quash an indictment for driving under the influence in a public place, holding that allegations in the indictment were sufficient to apprise appellant of the act she was charged with committing and that there was no merit in the contention that the indictment was not sufficient to enable appellant to prepare a defense or to bar subsequent prosecutions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review claiming that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Appellant challenged his conviction on the ground that the trial court should not have denied his pre-trial motion to quash information. The court affirmed defendant's conviction holding that the information sufficiently apprised appellant of the charges against him as it tracked the language of the statute, the words of the statute had plain meaning and did not prevent appellant from acquiring notice of the offense charged, the statute's caption was not constitutionally defective, and the language of the statute was not vague or ambiguous.

On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence that was obtained during an unlawful seizure pursuant to an illegal traffic roadblock. The court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial holding that the roadblock was not authorized by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687(b), &sect; 13 (1986), because it was not solely for the purpose of conducting driver's license checks. Alternatively, the roadblock, in light of the evidence presented, was a subterfuge to catch drunk drivers which was unconstitutional because it failed to pass the test of balancing a legitimate governmental interest against the degree of intrusion on the individual's U.S. Cont. amend. IV rights. Hence, the evidence stemming from the seizure at the invalid roadblock should have been suppressed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical doctor was convicted of commercially dispensing a controlled substance, a felony.

Appellant contended that the indictments for which he was convicted were not under the Controlled Substances Act, but were defined in rules promulgated by the Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. The court held that, regardless of how the indictments characterized the offenses and regardless of whether the charged offenses were offenses under the Texas Controlled Substances Act, the offenses for which appellant was convicted were clearly offenses under the Texas Controlled Substances Act. Under &sect; 4.01, appellee's decision was not erroneous and the trial court did not err in affirming that decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and appealed. The court affirmed, finding that defendant's speedy trial right, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02, was not violated where defendant signed three agreed reset forms and was tried within 120 days. The court found that sufficient evidence established a corpus delicti of the murder. One occasion of improper jury argument about which defendant complained was proper because it commented on evidence presented at trial, and the other two occasions were cured when defendant's objections were sustained and instructions to disregard were given. The court concluded that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) was not unconstitutional, that defendant could not complain on appeal of the denial of a motion for severance that he never made, and that the state did not bolster its witness's testimony by having a police officer testify before her. The trial court's refusal to admit defendant's complete written confession and his audio recorded oral confession was proper where exclusion did not infringe on defendant's constitutional rights, but admission would have infringed on co-defendant's constitutional right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, sought a motion for rehearing in a case that originated in a District Court of Dallas County (Texas).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, contended on motion for rehearing that the court's previous opinion erred in failing to apply a proper constitutional analysis and in failing to require exhaustion of administrative remedies as a condition to appellant condominium developers' appeal. The court denied appellee's motion for rehearing. Based on its analysis of recent precedent, the court held that appellee's claims of exclusive jurisdiction under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1464 and 1729 offended the basic principles of U.S. Const. art. III and were unconstitutional to the extent that judicial review of state law counterclaims raised in administrative proceedings was improperly restricted to a determination of whether administrative action was arbitrary and capricious. With respect to the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies, the court noted that it was not a jurisdictional rule but was a matter committed to judicial discretion and an exercise of comity only. Finally, as to construction of statutes, the court noted that although a court would strain to construe a statute so as to avoid a constitutional issue, it would not judicially rewrite the statute to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion for rehearing was denied because the language and prevailing construction of jurisdictional statutes were too plain to support a construction that would avoid their constitutional infirmity; thus, the court had to address the constitutional issue. Further, exhaustion of remedies was not a jurisdictional rule.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the convictions and trial court error in instructing the jury on the law of parol in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Police officers were conducting surveillance in a garage where numerous vehicles had been burglarized. After observing defendant leaving the garage, the officers stopped him and discovered two car stereos with damaged wiring wrapped in a woman's coat defendant was carrying. The police returned to the garage and found two cars that had been broken into, the owners who had identified the stereos, and the woman who owned the coat. Additionally, defendant's fingerprint was recovered from the door handle of one of the damaged cars, and defendant offered to pay for the damage. The court found sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Travis County, 331st Judicial District (Texas), which convicted him of involuntary manslaughter, a lesser-included offense of murder for which he was indicted, under Tex. Pen. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.02, 19.05 (1974). Defendant challenged the jury instruction on parole, jury misconduct, use of grand jury testimony, denial of a motion in limine, and refusal to charge criminal negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder and convicted of the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, under Tex. Pen. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.02 and 19.05 (1974). On appeal, the court held that the parole instruction statute,&nbsp;Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (1987), did not produce an unconstitutional judicial interference with the clemency powers assigned to the Governor and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled defendant's motion for new trial based on one juror's misconduct in considering the effect of parole in assessing punishment. The court found that relevant portions of grand jury testimony of one of defendant's witnesses had been disclosed to defendant. The court further held that a motion in limine did not preserve anything for appeal where defendant did not present or object to the evidence at trial. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to the criminal negligence instruction because he was aware of the risk involved in his conduct and the intervention of an unanticipated factor did not alter that fact. Therefore, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of involuntary manslaughter because, inter alia, the jury instruction on parole did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers and was not unconstitutionally vague, a single juror's misconduct did not invalidate the verdict, denial of a motion in limine did not preserve the issue for appeal, and the criminal negligence charge was properly refused.</SPAN></P>

Section 4, which prohibited jurors from considering parole and good conduct time, was not unconstitutional. The section was designed to benefit defendants because it was devised to reduce the incidence of juror misconduct. The trial court immediately instructed the jury to disregard the prosecutor's statements, so such instruction cured improper jury argument concerning the statements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant home manufacturer challenged a decision from the 125th District Court Harris County (Texas) that granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, developer and engineer, in appellant's cross-action for contribution and indemnity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Homeowners initiated an action against appellant home manufacturer alleging that appellant sold them homes on a geological fault line. Five years after such action was filed, appellant filed a cross-action for indemnity and contribution against appellees, developer and engineer. Appellees filed motions for summary judgment on the grounds that the 10 year statutes of repose found in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 16.008 and &sect; 16.009 barred appellant's action. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Appellees proved that there work was completed more than 10 years before suit, so appellant's action was barred. Appellant did not provide any evidence supporting its allegation that appellees' fraud tolled the running of the statute. Appellees were entitled to the protection afforded engineers and developers under the statutes because appellant did not produce any evidence that appellees were not registered engineers or developers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision because appellant home manufacturer's action was barred by the 10 year statute of repose. There was no dispute of fact because appellees proved that their work was substantially completed more than 10 years before suit. Appellant failed to bring forth any evidence supporting its fraudulent concealment allegations.</SPAN></P>

After defendant was sentenced, he contended that his plea was not voluntarily entered because the trial court did not explain the consequences of a nolo contendere plea. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(c), which provided that substantial compliance with the admonishment statute was sufficient. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. Pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(b), the trial court did not have to define or explain a nolo contendere plea. The trial court was only required to determine if defendant entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily. The record established that the trial court properly accepted defendant's plea. Defendant could not challenge the constitutionality of art. 26.13(c) because it was not applicable. The trial court far exceeded the requirements of the admonishment rule, so the issue of substantial compliance was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, construction company, sought review of a judgment of the 152nd District Court of Harris County (Texas), which awarded damages to appellee, contractor, for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud in connection with a joint venture agreement. Appellant argued that the agreement was illegal and unenforceable and that the trial court erred in rulings on discovery, evidence, lost profits and punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, construction company, was awarded two contracts with a city to construct sewers. Appellant entered into two joint venture agreements with appellee, contractor, to share responsibility, control, and profits of the sewer projects. Appellant diverted money from the projects to his own account and appellee filed an action for an accounting and damages. A jury awarded actual and punitive damages, along with attorney's fees. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance approving the contracts with appellant, which prohibited subcontracting, did not make the joint venture agreements illegal. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting discovery or, if it did, it was harmless and not grounds for reversal and retrial. However, the court held that the trial court erred in awarding punitive damages where there was no independent finding of actual damages in tort and the evidence offered to prove lost profits on one of the projects did not support that part of the verdict. The court also held that the appeal bond did not violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Therefore, the court modified the judgment as to damages and otherwise affirmed it.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the indictment was sufficient to apprise appellant of the charge against him. The indictment set forth all of the elements of aggravated assault, including the use of a deadly weapon, and specified that the deadly weapon was a firearm. The court also determined that the indictment is not required to allege a specific place where the offense occurred when the location is not an element of the offense charged. With regard to the evidence of appellant's prior conviction, which was admitted during the punishment phase, the court found that appellant made no effort to demonstrate how, or on what basis he claimed the prior conviction was void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the trial court of the offense of burglary of a building with intent to commit theft. The court affirmed. The court held that although the form of one of the prosecutor's questions was objectionable, its substance was not inherently harmful. The instruction to the jury to disregard removed whatever harmful effect the witness's expression of his opinion may have had on the jury's evaluation of appellant's credibility. The court also held that in closing argument, the state was allowed to comment on appellant's failure to call competent and material witnesses, and to argue that the reason for such failure was that any such testimony would be unfavorable to appellant. The court further held that an instruction to the jury on probable cause for appellant's arrest would have been required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23, only if the evidence to establish the legality of his arrest had been in dispute. Appellant's testimony raised no factual issues about the probable cause for his arrest, and therefore no special instruction was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 185th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of burglary of a building with intent to commit theft. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the security company tape recording of the break-in without the proper predicate having been shown. He also argued that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on parole laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for burglary of a building after a security monitor signaled a break-in at a plumbing company. Police arrived to find appellant first crouching in a window of the business and then climbing out of the broken window. Appellant was convicted of burglary of a building with intent to commit theft. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that appellant's objection to the admission of the security tape of the break-in at trial did not comport with his complaint on appeal of improper predicate for the admission of the tape. Further, although the evidence showed that the security console held many accounts, only the plumbing company's was on the screen the night of appellant's arrest. Additionally, even if proper predicate for the tape was not laid, such error was harmless where appellant was seen exiting the building through a broken window, and he attempted to flee the scene. The court held that appellant had failed to preserve his argument that the jury instruction on parole laws given in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1987), was unconstitutional because he did not object to the instruction at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for burglary of a building and held that, even if the proper predicate for the admission of the security company's tape was not laid, the error was harmless because there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction without the tape. Appellant could not complain of the constitutionality of the jury instruction on parole laws where he failed to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for the felony offense of injury to a child. After proper admonishment, the appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere without an agreed recommendation of punishment by appellee state. The trial court found appellant guilty as charged and reset the punishment hearing pending preparation and review of a pre-sentence investigation report. After hearing evidence at the punishment hearing, the court assessed punishment at two years confinement. The appellant then requested to withdraw her plea, which was denied. Appellant challenged the judgment, raising two points of error. The court affirmed the trial court judgment and overruled both points of error. First, because appellant had not challenged the constitutionality of the statute in the trial court, the issue was waived. Secondly, the trial court was not required to order that the plea of nolo contendere be withdrawn.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly denied his motion to dismiss pursuant to the Speedy trial Act, Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 32A.02 (Supp. 1987). The court reasoned that the evidence adduced by appellant was insufficient to rebut the state's prima facie showing that the state was ready for trial in conformity with the Speedy Trial Act. The court also held that the trial court did not err in overruling appellant's objection to the competency of a child witness. The court reasoned that in response to appellant's objection, the trial court conducted an examination of the witness and found her to be competent. The court held that appellant received all the relief he requested.

Plaintiff filed the default judgment and an affidavit of last known address in the respondent county court, requesting issuance of an abstract of judgment and a writ of execution. A corrected abstract of judgment and a corrected execution was issued. Respondent also issued a turnover order of relator debtor's stock for a sale under the writ of execution.

On appeal, the court conditionally granted the petition and held a plenary suit or a plenary hearing was not required for recognition and enforcement of a foreign money judgment and &sect; 36.00 et seq., was unconstitutional because it did not provide a procedure for relator, a judgment debtor, to receive notice and to have an opportunity to assert grounds for nonrecognition of a foreign country money judgment.

The court also stated that the test for whether the property was held for only public purposes was whether it was used exclusively for the use and benefit of the public. The court held that since offices where leased to physicians in connection with their private practice, the property was not held for a purely public purpose and therefore was not exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to appellees, appraisal district and appraisal review board, holding that a medical office building owned by appellant hospital authority was not exempt from taxation because it was not used for a purely public purpose. Appellant rented space to physicians for the physicians' private practice, and such use destroyed any exemption from taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following cross-actions by appellants, parents, retailer, and apartment owner, appellee manufacturers moved for summary judgment in a wrongful death action. Appellees claimed that the wrongful death action involving the installation and manufacture of a faulty wall heater was barred by the 10-year statute of repose under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 16.009 (1986). The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. The court reversed this decision. The terms of &sect; 16.009 required that appellees conclusively establish that the heater they designed and manufactured was installed in decedent's apartment more than 10 years prior to the commencement of this action, and also that the heater constituted an &quot;improvement&quot; to real property. Appellees showed that the wall heater constituted an improvement to real property, but they failed to show that the wall heater was installed more than 10 years prior to the action. Allegations in appellees' summary judgment motions were not summary judgment evidence, and testimony failed to conclusively establish the date that the heater was installed. Thus, the trial court's decision had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that pursuant to the Batson test, appellant established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in state's jury selection because as an African American, appellant was the member of a cognizable racial group, state used its peremptory challenges to remove from venire members of appellant's race, and did so on account of race.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(5) (1987), and sentenced him to life after a finding of two previous felony convictions. Appellant challenged his conviction. On appeal the court affirmed the trial court. The court first held that a videotape was properly admitted as the officer who took the video had extensive experience and videotaped 20 to 30 child victims a month, so that he was competent. The court also held that, due to an amendment to Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, the court no longer had the power to declare an act of the legislature unconstitutional due to the insufficiency of the caption, so that appellant's challenge to the caption was automatically overruled. The court further held that a declarant's out of court statement did not violate the confrontation clause as the complainant was effectively cross-examined. Finally, appellant could not question the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, because it was appellee state who would be the aggrieved party, not appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator ex-husband's ex-wife filed a motion to hold relator in contempt for failure to pay child support, past-due spousal and child support ordered by the divorce decree, and for refusing to turn over certain personal property awarded her in the divorce decree. The trial court found relator guilty of contempt and ordered confinement until relator had paid the arrearages, costs, attorney fees. Relator filed a petition for habeas corpus. The court found that the trial court's contempt decree was not void. Although relator proceeded pro se at the contempt hearing, he was fully aware of his right to counsel and was not indigent. Although the court reversed the finding of contempt for relator's refusal to surrender items, the court held that relator was not entitled to release from the coercive portion of his confinement because the void portion of the judgment was severable.

While the trial court should have included definitions in the charges to the jury, appellant did not object, and the error did not rise to egregious harm. The court considered the entire jury charge, the state of the evidence, the argument of counsel, and other relevant evidence. The court also held that the trial judge's misstatement in the parole instruction was harmless because a second instruction directed the jury not to consider an award or forfeiture of good conduct time.</SPAN></P>

Appellant then filed a post-conviction writ of habeas corpus with the Court of Criminal Appeals, which granted him an out-of-time appeal. The court subsequently recalled the original mandate and issued an order allowing appellant sufficient time to review the record and file a pro se brief. Defendant complained in two points of error of the use of one of the prior convictions and the introduction of the &quot;pen packets&quot; before the jury because the conviction was void and the judgment was neither definite nor certain as to the punishment assessed. The court overruled both points of error. The court found that each of the prior convictions showed the verdict was a certain number of years and the judgment applied the indeterminate sentence law by assessing the minimum punishment as that minimum required by law and by assessing the maximum as that set by the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company sought review of the decision of the District Court of Travis County, 98th Judicial District (Texas), which rejected its plea for pre-judgment &quot;interest&quot; on excess gross premiums taxes paid to appellee state, pursuant to Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 4.10. Appellant contended that it was entitled to the interest as part of its claim for compensatory damages occasioned by appellee's wrongful collection of excessive taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company was awarded recovery for the excess gross premiums tax that it paid to appellee state involuntarily under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 4.10. The court reversed that part of the judgment that rejected appellant's plea for pre-judgment &quot;interest&quot; on the excess taxes and remanded the matter to the trial court to calculate the pre-judgment interest. The legislature consented to the suit by a resolution, but it did not expressly provide for a waiver of immunity as to prejudgment interest. The court found that the &quot;interest&quot; that appellant sought was not like conventional interest, or interest eo nomine, but was more like interest as damages. The court found that appellant's claim was liquidated and a kind in which pre-judgment interest had always been recoverable. It recognized that the word &quot;interest&quot; was a misnomer when used to refer to interest as damages. Although appellee, as a state, was not normally liable for interest in the absence of a statute or express contract providing for prejudgment interest, that rule only applied to conventional interest, and none of the possible exceptions applied that would have exempted appellee from liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded only that part of the judgment that had rejected appellant company's plea for pre-judgment &quot;interest&quot; on excess taxes that it paid to appellee state. The court found that appellant was entitled to the interest because it was not conventional interest, for which appellee was immune from collection, but was more like liquidated damages and, therefore, recoverable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant beneficiaries sought review of the decision of the District Court of Donley County, 100th Judicial District (Texas), which granted summary judgment for appellees, the state of Texas and the highway department. Appellants asserted that appellees violated their constitutional or civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985, 1985, 1986, 1988 when they negligently constructed a highway on which decedent was killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found appellant beneficiaries were permitted to take nothing against appellees, the state of Texas and the highway department, upon any claim predicated upon an alleged constitutional tort or a violation of appellants' constitutional or civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees. The court found that the general rule of sovereign immunity of appellee state applied even as related to damage suits directly against it for torts. The court did not consider appellee state to have waived its immunity by virtue of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983's definition of a &quot;person.&quot; The court found that because appellee highway department was a branch of appellee state, it was also not a person and shared appellee state's governmental immunity. The court found that summary judgment was proper, even though it was partially based upon the pleadings, because the pleadings showed that appellants' suit was against appellee state and appellee highway department and a suit against appellee highway department was a suit against appellee state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment for appellees, the state of Texas and the highway department, and found that appellant beneficiaries could take nothing against appellees upon any claim predicated upon an alleged constitutional tort or a violation of constitutional or civil rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by the trial jury for theft of property, enhanced by a prior conviction, and the trial court assessed punishment at 20 years confinement. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.10(b) (Supp. 1987) did not preclude the trial court from allowing amendment of the indictment because the statute applied only after the trial on the merits commenced and the amending occurred before jury selection. The court held that the word &quot;automobile&quot; in appellant's indictment included the word &quot;truck&quot; and therefore was a change of form rather than substance. The court held that appellant's substantial rights were not prejudiced by changing &quot;automobile&quot; to &quot;truck&quot; in the indictment. The court held that art. 28.10 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V by allowing the court and prosecutor to usurp the function of the grand jury in defining offenses because federal due process did not require the states to observe the Fifth Amendment's provision for presentment or indictment by the grand jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of murder, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02 (1974) and attempted murder, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 15.01 (1987). The conviction resulted from an incident in which appellant shot through the plate glass windows at a karate studio which he had attended with an Uzi semi-automatic rifle. Appellant challenged his convictions. On appeal the court affirmed the trial court. The court first held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a), which provided for jury instructions on sentencing that took into account the possibility of parole, was not an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches because Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 31 allowed the legislature to delegate rulemaking authority to the courts. The court also held that art. 37.07, &sect; 4 did not aggravate a crime, did not make it greater than when it was committed, and did not inflict greater punishment than that proscribed when the offense was committed, so that it was not an ex post facto law. Finally, appellant waived any error from a prosecutorial comment that appellant would &quot;do it again,&quot; by not requesting the jury to disregard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder, sentenced to life imprisonment, and fined $ 10,000.00. Appellant challenged his conviction, contending that the trial court erred during a hearing on the admissibility of appellant's written statement by admitting evidence of appellant's oral statements made during his custodial interrogation. The court affirmed, holding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 3822, &sect; 3(a) (1986) only precluded oral statements given in response to custodial interrogation that tended to elicit an incriminating response. The court found that the questions asked by the officer, as to whether appellant understood the Miranda warnings administered, whether appellant could read or write, and whether the written statement was correct, were not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The court also held that the jury instructions given by the trial court and mandated by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(b) were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, which convicted appellant of murder, because the trial court properly admitted an officer's testimony as to the voluntary conditions surrounding the statement given by appellant in response to custodial interrogation, because the questions were not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, nor were the jury instructions as to parole unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a fatal two vehicle collision, appellant consented to giving a blood specimen. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the blood alcohol specimen because the chain of custody was not properly established. On appeal, the court held that testimonial evidence of each officer and lab technician that had control of the bottle showed that no misplacement or tampering occurred to the sample, and that the chain of custody was sufficiently proven. The court further held that the introduction of a blood alcohol percentage into the statutory definition of the level of intoxication necessary for a finding of intoxication was not unconstitutional and did not create an impermissible encroachment into the province of the jury. The percentage was found to merely be another definition of intoxication. Finally, in affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court found that appellant was not denied the right to a speedy trial because continuances at the request or consent of defendant were excluded from the computation of time by which the state must be ready for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction for driving while intoxicated was affirmed because the chain of custody of the blood sample was without break and adequately established by the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of aggravated sexual assault on a child. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing his request for a jury instruction on alibi because he had no access to the child on the date the offense occurred, as alleged in the indictment. However, the evidence at trial showed that the date alleged was incorrect; the offense occurred earlier. In overruling that point of error, the court found that the state was not bound by the date alleged, as long as the evidence showed that the event occurred prior to the indictment and within the statute of limitations. Defendant also objected to the jury instruction given regarding the parole laws and good time. The court found, in affirming the conviction, that the instruction did not violate the due process rights of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sought review of the summary judgment granted by the 138th District Court, Cameron County, Texas, on his suit for medical negligence alleging appellees, doctor and medical group, negligently performed radiation treatment. Appellant contended that granting summary judgment was improper where there was a material issue of fact as to whether the patient had a reasonable opportunity to discover injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient received radiation treatment that resulted in severe stomach problems. Appellant alleged that no subsequent doctor told him his difficulties could have resulted from his previous treatment. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590I, &sect; 10.01 (1987), no health care liability claim could be commenced unless filed within two years of the occurrence of the tort. However, the court held that a material issue of fact existed as to whether appellant had a reasonable opportunity to discover that his injuries resulted from his prior radiation treatment. Appellant alleged that he was never informed of this information, while two doctors alleged that they personally informed him of that possibility. Therefore, the court found a genuine issue of material fact remained to be determined and that, if the trier of fact determined that appellant did not have a reasonable opportunity to discover the nature of his injury, the two-year limitation period was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court found that appellant's fraudulent concealment claim against appellees, doctor and medical group, who performed the radiation treatment could not be raised on appeal for the first time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Grant of motion for summary judgment in favor of appellees, doctor and medical group, was reversed and remanded because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether appellant patient had a reasonable opportunity to discover the cause of his injury. The court held that if there was no reasonable opportunity, then application of the statute of limitations against him would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 319th District Court of Nueces County, Texas, which convicted her of fraudulently applying for voter registration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of fraudulently applying for voter registration. On appeal, she challenged the statute under which she was convicted, Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 13.001-13.007 (1986), as unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed, holding that a person who engaged in conduct that was clearly proscribed could not complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others. The court found that where words of a criminal statute were not defined, courts would ordinarily give them their plain meaning. The court noted that the word &quot;applied,&quot; as where one applied for voter registration, was certainly not vague, but had an ordinary, common-sense meaning. The court also found the statute did not proscribe the same type of conduct by punishment under one section as a felony and another as a misdemeanor, as appellant argued. One section governed people like appellant, who acted without any claim of agency status, while another governed people who attempted to act as an applicant's agent. The court also rejected defendant's claim that evidence of other extraneous offenses by her was error, holding that they were relevant to her motivation and conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city proposed to increase the rates which its municipally owned utility charged nonresident ratepayers. Appellants, Texas Public Utility Commission and others, filed suit on the ground that appellee was exceeding its authority under the Public Utilities Regulation Act (PURA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Ann. art. 1446c, &sect; 26(c) (1987), included no statutory criteria to guide appellant Public Utility Commission in exercising its review authority. That judgment was reversed and rendered. The court held that the statutory language, legislative history, and judicial interpretation of PURA showed that, under PURA &sect; 26(c), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of two children and sentenced to life imprisonment for both convictions. Defendant appealed the judgment and claimed ineffective assistance of counsel and challenged the constitutionality of a statute requiring jury instructions as to parole law. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court was unable to find a reasonable probability that, absent the asserted errors, the jury would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. The defense attorney's failure to request a pretrial hearing as to voluntariness could have been a tactical decision based on his perception that the statement was voluntary. Defendant's election to testify as well as the introduction by the defense of psychiatric testimony constituted a waiver of defendant's U.S. Const. amend. V privilege. The court held that the statute requiring jury instructions about parole law violated neither the separation of powers doctrine nor the due process clause, and thus was constitutional under the Texas and U.S. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault and assessed 15 years and one day confinement by a jury.

The court found that denial of a mistrial was proper because, even if the state's prosecutor had made improper argument, the trial court's instructions cured the error and no prejudice resulted. The court held that defendant's constitutional challenge to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court refused to consider appellant's argument that the parole charge given pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The Court of Criminal Appeals (Texas), vacated the appellate court's reversal of appellant's conviction and remanded the case to the court for reconsideration in light of recent rulings regarding the use of a presumption in Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction in a bench trial for promoting obscene material, where his punishment was assessed at a fine, probated for one year. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (Supp. 1982). The court reversed appellant's conviction on constitutional grounds, but the higher court vacated the reversal and remanded the case back to the court for reconsideration. Specifically, the higher court directed the court to reconsider its ruling in light of the higher court's recent holding that the existence of the unconstitutional presumption in &sect; 43.23 as part of the law at the time of a non-jury trial would not constitute reversible error unless some matter of record indicated that the trial court had relied on the presumption alone in its judgment. In light of the higher court's decision, the court affirmed the trial court's conviction of appellant, reasoning that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the trial judge had relied solely on the presumption and the record contained sufficient evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator hospital was the defendant in an underlying wrongful death action in which plaintiff alleged that the deceased was given blood transfusions by relator which resulted in her contracting Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Relator, as defendant in the underlying action, sought a protective order in response to plaintiff's request for documents identifying blood donors. Respondent judge denied relator's request and entered an order compelling production and prohibiting contact of donors without further order of the court. The court held that respondent's order did not violate the physician-patient privilege of Tex. R. Evid. 509 because the privilege was not applicable as the record did not reflect that donors were seen by a physician or received medical care when they donated blood. The court found that respondent's order did not violate the donors' constitutional right to privacy. The court reasoned that, balancing the competing interests, the interest served by the order outweighed the donors' interest in privacy. The court also held that relator failed to establish that the ordered discovery was an abuse of discretion because of injury to any societal interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the plain language of the indictment gave appellant sufficient notice of the charge against him to prepare his defense. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant's statements to the grand jury were material, as required by &sect; 37.03, because it was clear that his testimony might have led the grand jury to rule the child's death accidental and not to seek prosecution of the person responsible for the child's death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to confinement for life. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, rejecting several points of error on appeal. Appellant contended that it was fundamental error to instruct the jury about parole eligibility as required by Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1987), because the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that appellant's failure to object at trial waived review of the constitutionality of the statute, and furthermore, that the statute had been held to be constitutional. There was no evidence to support a finding that appellant was incompetent to stand trial. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the insanity defense, because the trial testimony did not raise the defense. The trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant's motion for a court-appointed investigator, because defense counsel did not make a request for a specific amount of funds or indicate a specific reason for them. There was no showing that appellant was denied funds for expenses incurred, or that appellant was harmed by the denial of funds necessary for the proper investigation of the case.</SPAN></P>

Appellee petitioned the trial court for an injunction to enjoin appellants, city and chief of police, from enforcing the ordinance. The trial court issued a temporary injunction, and appellant's challenged. The court held that the trial court, as a court of equity, did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of a penal ordinance unless the ordinance was unconstitutional and the enforcement caused irreparable injury to vested property rights. Because appellee never claimed, nor did the trial court find, that the ordinance was unconstitutional, the trial court was without jurisdiction to issue the injunction.

The trial court waived jurisdiction for three offenses and retained one. Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery as an adult. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that on a motion to waive jurisdiction for multiple offenses, Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 54.02(g) required the child's status be fixed as a juvenile for all offenses once the juvenile court retained and exercised jurisdiction over any count in the certification petition, and the trial court's subsequent exercise of jurisdiction over retained offenses would have rendered invalid the order waiving jurisdiction. The court found no reversible error because there was no evidence that the trial court exercised jurisdiction over the one retained offense, the waiver of jurisdiction as to the other offenses was valid, and jurisdiction over defendant was acquired by the criminal district court. The court held the Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1987) parole instruction statute was constitutional, which resolved defendant's other points of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the probate court's order committing appellant for alcoholism. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5561c-2 (act) did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 because its provisions related to the same general subject of alcohol and drug abuse services offered by the state. The act's failure to require competent medical or psychiatric testimony prior to commitment did not violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15-a because that provision did not apply to persons committed as alcoholics. The act was not void for vagueness because it sufficiently defined alcoholism and the conditions under which an alcoholic could be committed such that a person of common intelligence would agree to the statute's meaning and application. The doctor's testimony was properly admitted because Tex. R. Evid. 509(d)(7) and 510(d)(4) provided exceptions to the doctor/patient privilege in involuntary commitment proceedings, and the probate court limited the doctor's testimony to information disclosed after appellant received a warning that the information was not confidential.

The writ was denied and he appealed. The court held that the Magistrates Act (Act), Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 54.301 et seq. (1986), was not properly complied with. The court held that the record affirmatively showed that the district judge did not review the actions taken by the magistrate and there were no findings, no conclusions, no orders, and no recommendations made by the magistrate, from which the district court could have reviewed the actions taken by the magistrate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, found guilty of theft in the 248th District Court, Harris County (Texas), alleged that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1987), was unconstitutional as vague and overbroad and violated U.S. amend. IV of the U.S. Constitution and that the trial court erred in overruling her objection to improper prosecutorial jury argument and committed reversible error when it admitted hearsay statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant obtained money from the complainant by a pigeon drop scheme, and was convicted at trial for theft. On appeal, the court held that appellant had not preserved error because she did not make the same objection at trial as she asserted on appeal. Further, the prosecutor's argument was a plea for law enforcement, but even if error, appellant waived her objection when she failed to obtain a ruling from the court. The appellate court found this evidence sufficient to show that the unknown third party was a co-conspirator in the conspiracy and that appellant was an active participant. The third party's statements to the complainant were offered into evidence to show the conspiracy and, as such, were admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for theft was affirmed where she had waived her errors on appeal and her co-conspirator's comments were admissible to show conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 230th District Court of Harris County (Texas). The trial court convicted appellant of attempted capital murder and sentenced appellant to 20 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer heard gunshots and shortly thereafter observed appellant's truck make a quick U-turn and begin speeding. The officer heard on a radio broadcast that another officer had found the victim of the shooting. The officer pulled the truck over and heard a description of the perpetrators on a second broadcast that matched the occupants of the truck. Appellant gave both oral and videotaped confessions. Appellant was convicted of attempted capital murder. The court affirmed. The officer had a sufficient basis to stop the truck before he heard the radio broadcast. The officer heard gunshots and observed appellant's truck make a fast U-turn in a deserted area; moreover, the officer observed appellant speeding before he pulled the vehicle over. The trial court, as the sole judge of credibility of the witnesses, was entitled to disbelieve appellant's testimony that the officers threatened to beat him if he did not speak. The prosecutor had not commented on appellant's failure to testify during the punishment phase when the prosecutor indicated that appellant had not said that he was sorry; the prosecutor had been referring to appellant's testimony during the guilt phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for attempted capital murder. The record supported the finding that appellant's confession was voluntary. Comments by the prosecutor that appellant was unrepentent did not violate appellant's right not to testify; the comments were references to appellant's testimony during the guilt phase of the trial, not to appellant's failure to testify during the punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

Appellants brought suit against appellee for gross negligence that proximately caused the death of their son. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that Tex. Const. art.

The trial court granted the motion and entered a take-nothing judgment against appellants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed. The court held that appellant failed to state in what specific respect appellant regarded the jury charge defective. Even if error was committed, eyewitness testimony that established appellant's role as the person who used the pistol and held it to the back of the victim's head, and as the one who took the money was sufficient to sustain appellant's conviction as a primary actor. Also, the evidence supported the argument that appellant actually took the money. Although appellant objected to the &quot;procedure&quot; involved in line-ups, appellant did not object specifically to the officer's testimony regarding his filing of charges against appellant, therefore that point of error was waived. In addition, the requirement that specific language in jury charges be set forth did not usurp the judicial function or violate separation of powers. The judiciary remained free to interpret the law and determine guilt or innocence. Finally, appellant did not preserve for review the error in charging the jury on parole pursuant to Tex. Const. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of aggravated robbery, holding the eyewitness testimony that established appellant's role both as the person who used the pistol and held it to the back of the victim's head and as the one who took the money, was sufficient alone to sustain appellant's conviction as a primary actor. The court ruled that appellant's claim that legislative amendments violated Tex. Const. was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

Appellant, however, gave notice to appellee rather than the review board, as required under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.06(b) (Supp. 1987).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding appellant guilty of credit card abuse, a jury found the enhancement allegations to be true and assessed punishment at 90 years confinement. Appellant filed an appeal, arguing that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1986), the parole charge, was unconstitutional because it violated the &quot;separation of powers&quot; doctrine embodied in Tex. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. The record revealed that appellant made no objection at trial to the constitutionality of the parole charge. The court affirmed, holding that the constitutionality of a statute might not be raised on appeal unless the issue was first raised in the trial court. Further, the court had previously held that the parole charge did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that appellant used the card knowing that it was not actually issued to him, in his own name, because he sought to obtain and to convert the name and background information of another living individual to his own use in his attempt to obtain funds on credit, and that he knew that he was not using the card with the effective consent of the cardholder.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was found guilty by the trial court and was assessed punishment at 180 days in jail and a fine. Pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.02 (1979), appellant challenged the decision on the sole point that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss the information on the basis he had been denied his rights under the Speedy Trial Act. Appellant contended that because more than 90 days had elapsed between his arrest and the filing of the information, he was denied a speedy trial on his misdemeanor charge. The state argued that the delay was justified due to extensive investigation generally required in cases to uncover and gather the evidence necessary to prove prior offenses. The court held that while misdemeanor and felony acts of driving while intoxicated were separate offenses with different elements for purposes of charge and proof of guilt, they were committed and arose out of the same transaction, so that one arrest commenced the time for each for purposes of a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to set aside the indictment under the Texas Speedy Trial Act. The record reflected that appellant was indicted on February 4, 1985. The state filed an announcement of ready for trial on February 20, 1985. Appellant was not arrested until December 17, 1985, far more than 120 days after the indictment was filed. The court held that the facts in the record supported the trial court's finding. The trial court found that the state had exercised due diligence in attempting to determine appellant's location. The trial court was the primary finder of fact on motions such as this one and its findings were not to be disturbed unless manifestly contrary to the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury convicted defendant of aggravated robbery, defendant challenged the conviction. In affirming, the court held that the trial court did not err by including an instruction on the law of parole, as authorized by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 37.07, because the statute was not unconstitutional for violating the constitutional separation of powers doctrine. Further, the court held that because there was no hard evidence that defendant would have been guilty of the lesser offense of aggravated assault, the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury on that lesser-included offense. Additionally, defendant's motion for mistrial was properly denied because prosecution's jury argument was not so extreme or manifestly improper as to have constituted reversible error. The court also held that because defendant did not file a motion to suppress identification prior to trial or make such objection at trial, the trial court did not err by permitting state to bolster the complainant's in-court identification with testimony by complainant that he identified defendant at a line-up. Finally, state could have impeached a witness by proof of a prior prostitution conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the 232nd District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated sexual assault. Defendant contended that there was no sufficient statutory definition of a critical term applicable to the statute under which he was charged, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02, and that it was meaningless and unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault for a rape committed with a deadly weapon. The court affirmed his convictions, rejecting his argument that the term &quot;criminal episode&quot; was not defined and that its use in the aggravated sexual assault statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02, was meaningless and unconstitutionally vague. The court held that where words were not defined in a statute, they were to be given their plain meaning. The term &quot;criminal episode&quot; included the time immediately before and after the assault. Thus, the criminal episode began when defendant restricted the victim and ended when she was released. Defendant argued that the criminal episode should be construed to be limited to the sexual act only, during which the victim could not see a knife. The court held that because the victim saw the knife immediately before and after the act, the evidence showed that the knife was exhibited during the criminal episode. Defendant's argument that jurisdiction was not proven failed because circumstantial evidence elicited from the witnesses' testimony was sufficient to show the crime occurred in the court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for sexual assault because, where no statutory definition of a term existed, the court gave the term its plain meaning. The term &quot;criminal episode,&quot; as used in the statute under which defendant was charged, had sufficiently clear meaning to support the finding that he committed the act for which he was indicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the District Court of Williamson County, (Texas), which convicted appellant for aggravated sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (Supp. 1987), and assessed punishment at imprisonment for 99 years. Appellant contended that the district court erred by giving the instruction on the law of parole that influenced the jury in his sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to the offense of aggravated sexual assault and received a sentence of 99 years. The victim of the sexual assault was his 10 year old son. In addition, appellant sexually violated both his son and eight-year-old daughter. Appellant complained that the district court erred by giving the instruction on the law of parole. On appeal, the court found that there was no evidence that the jury's consideration of the law of parole caused any juror to agree to a harsher punishment. The evidence at the new trial hearing established that the jury gave minimal consideration, at best, to assessing appellant's punishment at a lesser term of years. More important, the testimony also showed that the jury had unanimously agreed that punishment in this appeal should be set at either imprisonment for 90 years or imprisonment for life before any discussion of the parole law took place and before any effort was made to calculate the effect the choice of punishment might have on appellant's parole eligibility date, and that appellant's parole eligibility was considered only in choosing between the two &quot;maximum&quot; punishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant's conviction and 99 year prison sentence for the sexual assault of his three children were upheld, because there was no reversible error and no evidence that the jury's consideration of the law of parole caused any juror to agree to a harsher punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought relief by an appeal de novo from the County Court at Law No. 2 of Travis County (Texas), which found defendant guilty of failing to maintain financial responsibility in violation of the Safety Responsibility Law, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h. Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction as prosecution proved only that defendant failed to furnish evidence of financial responsibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver was operating a motor vehicle and failed to furnish evidence of financial responsibility when requested to do so by a law enforcement officer. On appeal from her conviction for failing to maintain financial responsibility in violation of the Safety Responsibility Law, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h, the court held that defendant's failure to furnish evidence of financial responsibility gave rise to a presumption that no policy of motor vehicle liability insurance was in effect in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h, &sect; 1C. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h, &sect; 1D, the burden was on defendant to raise the issue of the existence of an applicable liability insurance policy by coming forward with evidence supporting the defense. As defendant offered no evidence that an automobile liability insurance policy or certificate of self-insurance was in effect to insure against potential losses arising out of her operation of the vehicle at the time the offense was alleged to have occurred, the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment of conviction. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h, &sect; 1C, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver's conviction for failing to maintain financial responsibility in violation of the Safety Responsibility Law was affirmed, because her failure to furnish evidence of financial responsibility to the officer who stopped her vehicle constituted prima facie proof that she had no liability insurance policy. Because she failed to demonstrate financial responsibility at trial, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was not a judicial usurpation of executive power, but merely an instruction to the jury that it may have considered the existence of parole law and good conduct time without considering their effect on any punishment assessed. The court noted that the lower court erred when it denied defendant access to complainant's notes for purposes of cross-examination and impeachment.

The public intoxication charge was filed in municipal court and was dismissed pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act (act), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02(1987). On appeal, defendant argued that because the public intoxication and the cocaine charge arose from the same transaction and the public intoxication complaint had been discharged, dismissal of the cocaine charge was required by Tex.

The court found that Article 28.061 was mandatory and provided that if a charge was dismissed pursuant to the act, then any other offense arising out of the same transaction should be dismissed as well.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant drug manufacturer was arrested several miles from the scene where police found methamphetamine. The court affirmed appellant's conviction for possession of a controlled substance. The evidence affirmatively linked appellant to the contraband because police saw appellant leaving the building where the contraband was found, officers smelled odors associated with methamphetamine production while appellant was in the building, and utility bills for the building had appellant's name on them. Phenyl-2-propanone was a controlled substance pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 1.02(4) and an immediate precursor under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 1.02(18), that was used to manufacture methamphetamine. The Controlled Substances Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness despite the fact that it failed to define or mention adulterants and dilutants or diluents. The Act was vested with a presumption of validity, and its terms were not so vague that men of common intelligence had to guess its meaning or that it allowed the possibility of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant drug manufacturer's conviction for possession of a controlled substance because the facts and circumstances affirmatively linked appellant to the controlled substance in such a manner to sufficiently prove that he knew of the contraband as well as had control over it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers, under a warrant, entered a building and found a large amount of methamphetamine. A jury found appellant guilty of possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, weighing at least 400 grams including adulterants and dilutants and he was sentenced to confinement. Appellant challenged the conviction and the court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.04, the statute under which appellant was charged, was valid and not unconstitutionally vague. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence for a rational factfinder to conclude appellant's acts met the elements of the crime charged. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not err by refusing appellant's requested jury charge because it would not have aided the jury in deciding issues of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by the 337th District Court of Harris County, (Texas), for delivery of cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested during a drug bust after an undercover narcotics officer purchased cocaine from appellant and two co-defendants. Appellant's conviction for delivery of cocaine was affirmed. Although a comment by the prosecutor was improper, it did not amount to attorney misconduct and was based on evidence in the record. Because the comment was not a personal attack on appellant's counsel, it was not so extreme or inflammatory that an instruction to disregard would not have cured it. The prosecution's violation of a pretrial discovery order, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 39.14 (1986), was harmless error because photos of the house where the drugs were purchased did not affect the outcome of the trial where witnesses had already described the house. Use of a court reporter on re-cross examination to rebut a co-defendant's testimony that contradicted his earlier written statement was not bolstering of a prosecution's exhibit but proper impeachment of the co-defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and argued on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss for failure to grant a speedy trial. The delay in bringing appellant to trial was due solely to the trial court's crowded docket and a previously scheduled lengthy capital murder trial. The court found that the State announced ready for trial within the statutory time period and held that a mere showing by appellant that he was present in the county jail, but was not physically brought into the courtroom, did not by itself sufficiently rebut the presumption that the State was ready for trial. Once the State timely established that appellant was within its jurisdiction and it was ready for trial, the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.01-.02, was not negated by the subsequent actions of the trial court in temporarily removing appellant to another jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the trial court was not required sua sponte to hold a competency hearing during the trial because the issue of defendant's competence was raised pretrial. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the introduction of a videotape showing him being booked because he did not waive his right to have counsel present. The court held that defendant's rights were not violated because the video showed that he waived his right to counsel when he told the officer that he would not call his attorney until morning.

The trial court held that appellants had engaged in conduct that endangered the child and that the termination of appellants' parental rights was in the child's best interest. Pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 15.02 (Supp. 1986), the involuntary termination of parental rights was proper if the evidence proved that the parent knowingly placed the child in conditions which endangered the child or engaged in conduct which knowingly endangered the child and termination was in the best interest of the child. The court held that &sect; 15.02, did not require physical abuse toward the child but required conduct which endangered the child. The court overruled Higgins v.

The court also found that appellant's representation complied with U.S. Const. amend VI. Appellant failed to show that he was prejudiced by any errors of counsel, as the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction for theft, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a), (b)(1) (1987), entered by the 232nd District Court of Harris County (Texas), after a jury trial, because the evidence was allegedly insufficient to support the conviction, the indictment against defendant was facially defective, and the trial court allegedly committed various evidentiary and instructional errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased truck tires and tubes from a supplier, allegedly on behalf of his former employer. At the time of the sale, defendant represented that he was authorized to purchase the goods when he had actually been terminated. A jury found that defendant guilty of theft, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a), (b)(1) (1987), and that two enhancement paragraphs were true. Punishment was assessed by the jury at 25 years confinement. Defendant appealed the judgment and the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence supported the conclusion that the consent of the tire supplier was induced by defendant's deception. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction. Moreover, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction with regard to purportedly exculpatory statements, as they were not exculpatory. The court also found that defendant was not prejudiced by failure of the trial court to include a specific definition of deception. Finally, defendant's points of error with regard to his indictment and the trial court's jury instructions contained only conclusory statements and, therefore, presented no issues for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction for theft because the evidence established that defendant deceived a tire supplier into believing that he was authorized to purchase the goods on behalf on another. The court also found that defendant was not prejudiced when the trial court declined to give his requested jury charges. The court further found that defendant failed to properly present his other points of error on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter committed when operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. As part of his probation, appellant was required to serve 120 days in confinement pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 6b(c) (1987). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction and rejected appellant's points of error pertaining to &sect; 6b(c). The court determined that appellant failed to demonstrate that &sect; 6b(c) was unconstitutional as it was applied to him because he had received the minimum term of confinement, 120 days, provided by the statute. Therefore, the fact that the statute did not provide minimum guidelines did not harm appellant. The court further found that the 120 day term was not an unconstitutionally disproportionate length of time for appellant to serve in light of the fact that his driving while intoxicated resulted in the loss of human life. Finally, the court rejected appellant's contention that &sect; 6b(c) failed to provide adequate notice of the bill's content because Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35(c) provided that a law could not be held void on the basis of an insufficient title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted after a jury trial of delivery of more than one-fourth ounce and less than four ounces of marijuana and was sentenced to 12 years confinement. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and rejected appellant's points of error. The court found that the trial court's use of the parole charge set forth in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1986) was proper because the case that had found that statute to be unconstitutional had been withdrawn, and the statute was constitutional. The court further found that the record reflected that appellant did not object when the trial court excused a prospective juror on its own motion, and therefore the error alleged by appellant was not preserved for review. Finally, the court determined that the prosecutor's arguments to the jury were not intended to persuade the jury to consider the parole law in assessing appellant's punishment, but rather were a plea to the jury to assess a longer period of confinement than had been previously assessed because appellant had not been rehabilitated by an earlier confinement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of extraneous offenses at the punishment stage of the trial.

As to the argument that the trial court erred in refusing defendant's instruction on identification, the court held that the charge was sufficient with the instruction that the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the offense. The court also held that the record did not show that the defendant made a trial objection to the instructions so the issue was not preserved for appeal.

The trial court modified appellant's determination by recognizing equitable water rights for appellees. The court affirmed and held that the trial court was authorized to use its constitutional equity powers as it did, and that the evidence sustained such action. The court found that trial courts had equitable power by virtue of Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 (amended 1891), and that such equitable power was available in a proper situation to recognize water rights in land owners adjacent to rivers whose grants were patented prior to January 20, 1840. All parties had stipulated that for each claim at issue, the original land grant was made prior to January 20, 1840. The court found that appellees had used the river for a long time, with no complaints, had spent large sums developing irrigation systems, and that property values would be greatly reduced if water rights were denied. Thus, the evidence sustained the modification. The court also held that there was no error in setting the priority date as the date of first beneficial use for each appellee.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff oil company was directed to file a remittitur of 2 billion dollars. Failure to file the remittitur would lead to reversal and remand of the judgment. On the remaining points of error the court held that the evidence supported the jury finding that a binding agreement existed between plaintiff and a third oil company for the purchase of the third company. Defendant knew of the agreement prior to its own purchase offer and tortiously induced a breach of that agreement. The jury charge correctly stated the law and explanatory instructions were proper to enable the jury to render a verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs surviving wife and parents appealed from the judgment notwithstanding the verdict that was entered by the District Court of Dallas County (Texas) in favor of defendant hospitals in a wrongful death medical malpractice action pursuant to the Texas Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (Supp. 1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs surviving wife and parents in a wrongful death medical malpractice action against defendant hospitals. However, the trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed. The appellate court reversed in an unpublished opinion and rendered judgment on the verdict for plaintiffs subject to the $ 500,000 limitation set out in the Texas Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 11.02(a) (Supp. 1986), as adjusted for inflation. But because remittiturs were also suggested with respect to each plaintiff, only plaintiff surviving wife's award was over the limit and thus subject to reduction. The court ruled that the recovery cap and disparate treatment created by the cap did not violate the due process or equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, or the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, because the limitation was rationally related to the legitimate governmental goal of reducing the frequency and severity of medical liability claims in order to make health care more affordable and available to all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for defendants was reversed, judgment was rendered for plaintiffs on the jury verdict, and remittiturs were suggested as to each plaintiff in an unpublished opinion. The award to plaintiff surviving wife was further reduced by application of the limits imposed by the Medical Liability Act because her jury award exceeded those limits and the limitations did not violate her due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought a rehearing of the appeal by the court, which affirmed the order of the 262nd District Court, Harris County (Texas) dismissing the indictment of the accused on speedy trial grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought a rehearing by the court of an appeal in which the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the indictment against the accused on speedy trial grounds. The court overruled the motion for rehearing. The court found no merit in the state's contention that in order for Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 to operate to bar further prosecution, the entire indictment, rather than a single offense, must be dismissed. The state had stipulated that the two separate offenses arose from the same transaction, and one of the offenses was dismissed on speedy trial grounds. The court pointed out that the discharge portion of the statute referred to offenses, not indictments. There was no significance to the fact that the discharged offense was pleaded as part of an indictment and not as a separate indictment. The court had no jurisdiction to consider whether the trial court's ruling was plainly erroneous, because the state had no right to appeal in criminal cases. The court held that neither the Speedy Trial Act nor Article 28.061 violated the separation of powers doctrine set out in Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the state's motion for rehearing. The statute in question barred prosecution of any offenses arising out of the same transaction as an offense dismissed on speedy trial grounds, and it made no difference that the offense the state wished to prosecute was part of an indictment rather than a separate indictment. The speedy trial statutes did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">17 year old defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder committed during the robbery of a convenience store. The court affirmed holding that the evidence when viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict was evidence from which any rational trier of fact could have found all of the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that because defendant neither joined the State's request for an instruction on the lesser included offense of murder nor objected to the failure of the charge to include it, error on this point was not preserved for review. The court held that because the evidence showed that the conduct of defendant alone was sufficient to sustain the conviction, or supported defendant's guilt as a principal actor, any error resulting from a failure to charge the jury on the law of parties was harmless error. The court held that the prosecutor's closing argument regarding flight was proper. The court held that defendant was properly prosecuted for capital murder and that the statutory scheme which required a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stood guard at the door with a gun while two others shot a drug dealer and stole the dealer's money and cocaine. Appellant was indicted for aggravated robbery. At trial, the trial court charged the jury on the theory of parties; appellant did not object. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to 20 years. Appellant sought review, contending that he was denied a fair and impartial trial and due process because the indictment failed to give him notice of the specific theory with which he was charged. The court affirmed the conviction. Appellant's failure to object to the charge on parties undermined his contention that he was surprised by the charge. Appellant's objection to the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, was not raised at trial, and had already been rejected by another court. The court held that appellant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel merely because his lawyer misspoke appellant's name and used the word &quot;hisself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court instructed the jury on the law of parole as mandated by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 (Supp. 1987); however, appellant did not offer any objections to said charge. Subsequently, the trial court found that appellant had two previous felony convictions as alleged and assessed punishment at 60 years' confinement. Appellant sought review, claiming that article 37.07 was unconstitutional and that the charge itself created an irreconcilable conflict. The court overruled appellant's point of error and affirmed. The court found that article 37.07 was constitutional. In addition, the court found that appellant failed to preserve any error by failing to object to the charge at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. The court affirmed the conviction and held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-1 &sect; (a)(2)(B) was not unconstitutionally vague for having different weight measurements due to different measuring substances or for not making sense because defendant's reading was strained. The court rejected defendant's claim that the statute was vague because of his lack of expertise. The court refused to rule on defendant's claim that state must plead the measure of intoxication used because this claim differed from the trial objection. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling against defendant's motion to quash the information because Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.22 (1966) did not require a complaint to be filed before the information. The court held defendant was not deprived of his Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 right to counsel because no right existed during a breath test. The court held there was no error in admitting the results of defendant's intoxilyzer test because 37 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 19.01-19 (1984) did not require individual certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of driving while intoxicated because the charging statute was not unconstitutionally vague, the motion to quash the information was properly denied because the complaint did not need to be filed before the information, defendant did not have a right to counsel during his breath test, and individual certification of the intoxilyzer test was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision by the 228th District Court of Harris County, Texas, in which appellant pled guilty to a jury of felony possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, namely, at least 400 grams of cocaine, and the jury assessed punishment at 55 years of confinement and a fine of one dollar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a decision by the trial court which, following appellant's plea of guilty before a jury of felony possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, assessed punishment at 55 years of confinement. The court held that appellant's guilty plea was voluntary because appellant was given the range of punishment and failed to show either materiality of other admonishments or harm, and the trial court complied with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13 by giving the admonishment required. Appellant was not denied a fair and impartial trial by submission of certain jury instructions because no objection was made to that portion urged on appeal as unconstitutional; appellant failed to show he was harmed by the instruction; and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(4)(b) had previously been upheld as constitutional. Because appellant did not object at trial that the state's remarks constituted an impermissible allusion to the parole laws, he could not raise the objection at the appellate level. While the prosecutor's statements were improper, they were not so manifestly improper as to constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court erred in unduly restricting his right to conduct voir dire examination. The right of counsel to question veniremembers and the right of the trial court to control the voir dire must be balanced. The court evaluated the reasonableness of a time limitation by noting whether or not an appellant did not attempt to prolong the voir dire, showed that he was not permitted to ask proper questions, and showed that he was not permitted to examine jurors who served on the jury. Here appellant attempted to prolong voir dire by questioning prospective jurors whom he had questioned earlier.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for aggravated robbery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.03(a)(2) (1974). Defendant argued that the trial court erred by including in its charge at the punishment stage of trial an instruction related to parole, as mandated by Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. &sect; art. 37.07, &sect; 4(e) (1986). Defendant argued that the instruction operated as an ex post facto law and was therefore unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. art. 37.07, &sect;4 (1986), which generally apprised the jury of the nature of parole and the possibility that defendant's prison term could be shortened by application of good time credits and parole, did not violate Tex. Const. Ann. art. I. &sect; 16 (1984). The statute was procedural in nature rather than substantive. Moreover, the statute correctly instructed the jury not to consider the manner in which the parole law might be applied to a particular defendant. The statute was not facially unconstitutional and did not operate as an ex post facto law. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual abuse of a child in the trial court. Appellant sought the court's review, asserting that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.10(b) (repealed 1983) discriminated against homosexuals by failing to make the promiscuity defense available to them in the same way that it was available to heterosexuals. The court reversed appellant's conviction, holding that appellant was denied the promiscuity defense of &sect; 21.10(b), in violation of the equal protection guarantees. Appellee filed a petition for discretionary review in the trial court for further consideration of appellant's case in light of newly decided case law. The trial court granted the petition and remanded to the court. The court held that there was no authority which held that homosexual conduct was a constitutionally protected activity under the equal protection clause or the state equal rights amendment, and appellant had cited to none in his appeal. Further, the constitutionality of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 21.06, which declared homosexual conduct a misdemeanor offense, had been upheld against a claim that it constituted an equal protection violation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of aggravated robbery. Prior to entering his plea, defendant made a motion requesting the state to elect between the two counts. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction of the first count of aggravated robbery. The court ruled that defendant could not raise its objection regarding the constitutionality of jury instruction regarding parole on appeal for the first time as it was not raised at trial, that the jury instruction was not vague or misleading, that the trial court did not err in determining that aggravated robbery was one of the offenses covered under article 21.24(a) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure which allows two or more offenses to be joined in a single indictment, with each offense stated in a separate count, if the offense arises out of the same criminal episode. However, the court reversed the conviction of the second count of aggravated robbery, and remanded it to the trial court, because defendant was entitled to severance of the two kidnapping offenses upon his request for an election between the two counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physically assaulted the complainant and took her purse as she got into her automobile. Defendant denied commission of the offense. The trial court convicted defendant of robbery, found that defendant had two previous felony convictions, and assessed punishment at confinement for 50 years. The court affirmed the judgment and held that there was no prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor testified, denying that any suggestion was made to a witness that one of the photographs would be the photo of the suspect in the case in which the witness was involved. The court found that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the law affecting good time and parole, Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1986), because the statute was not unconstitutional. Although the trial court mistakenly stated that defendant pleaded guilty instead of not guilty, defendant made no objection, and therefore, did not preserve the matter for review. Furthermore, the docket sheet, the court's charge, and the judgment all reflected that defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect;21.11(1986). During the trial of this action, the court permitted videotaped testimony of the child, which showed the child demonstrating how appellant sexually abused her, even though appellant was unable to cross-examine the child at the time of the questioning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of indecency with a child under Tex. Penal Code &sect;21.11(1986). Appellant challenged the conviction and contended that the trial court erred in several respects with regard to the admission of evidence and violated appellant's constitutional rights of confrontation. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction. The court stated that it could not review appellant's contentions of error regarding the jury charges, the competency of the child witness, or the failure of the trial court to require cross-examination of the child witness immediately after the presentation of her videotaped testimony because appellant failed to object properly to these issues at trial, and thus, they were not preserved for review. The court also found that appellant failed to preserve any issue regarding the State's impeachment of its own witness. Finally, the court held that appellant's right to confront the child witness was not violated by this inability to be present during the videotaping of the child witness because appellant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant client filed a legal malpractice suit against appellee attorney. The suit stemmed from appellee's representation of both appellant and her ex-husband in their divorce proceedings. Ten months after the divorce settlement, appellant learned that pursuant to a change in the agreement made by appellee, her ex-husband was filing partition suit on the marital home which appellant occupied with her children. Appellant had believed that such a suit was prohibited under their agreement. She then filed her action against appellee. A jury awarded to her actual damages and exemplary damages. However, the trial court then granted appellee's motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and entered a take-nothing judgment against appellant. On appeal, the court held that the two-year tort limitations statute provided a solid ground for the trial court's judgment. The court reasoned that the limitations was tolled until December 10, 1979, at the latest. Because appellant did not file her malpractice action until December 21, 1981, she exceeded the two-year period and her suit was barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borrowers filed suit against appellees, receiver, lender, and various trustees, and sought the prevention of foreclosure on its property, to cancel deeds of trust, damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees. Appellees moved to dismiss asserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to 12 U.S.C.S. &sect;1464(d)(6)(c). The trial court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction and appellants challenged the judgment. The court reversed the portion of the judgment pertaining to the adjudication of rights that arose under state law and stated that these claims were to have been adjudicated by a judiciary authorized by U.S. Const. art. III. The court stated that it had appropriate jurisdiction to hear appellants' challenges, that a uniform body of federal laws was not required to determine the parties' dispute, and that Congress could not remove appellants' state law claims from the judiciary. The court affirmed the portion of the judgment that appellants' actions under the federal securities' laws and those aimed at appellee receiver for disparagement of title and violation of state foreclosure laws were within the authority of agency adjudication.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the conviction was reversed and reformed to show a judgment of acquittal. The court held that because defendant did not admit guilt to the crime for which he had been convicted, he did not waive his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The court held that the prosecution attempted to prove defendant's control and knowledge by an inference from defendant's response to a pre-arrest question posed by an officer. There were no direct facts to support the inference. Defendant was in the area where the drug was found, but was not in personal possession of or exercising control over the marijuana. There was no evidence of furtive gestures toward the contraband, no attempt to escape, no evidence that defendant was under the influence of marijuana or other drugs, and no incriminating statements. The evidence amounted to a suspicion of guilt through the stacking of inferences and was insufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the District Court of Lampasas County (Texas), convicting appellant as a party to the offense of theft by deception pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 31.01, 31.03, and 7.02. Appellant was sentenced to confinement for 20 years and a fine of $ 80,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and other relatives in efforts to obtain loans told many people that appellant's aunt was the heiress of her husband's multi-million dollar Swiss estate. Depending upon the potential lender, the value of the estate assets ranged from one million to ten million dollars and consisted of vineyards, chocolates, watches, or cuckoo clocks. Appellant and her aunt employed an attorney to set up a trust to place the estate proceeds when received, but only $ 10 was ever placed in the trust. The actual value of the estate belonging to the husband of appellant's aunt was $ 24,000. An elderly victim purchased 11 cashier's checks totaling over $ 500,000 and gave them to appellant's aunt as a loan so that she could close out her husband's multi-million dollar estate and obtain the assets. Appellant was convicted as a party to the offense of theft by deception. She contended that the evidence was insufficient to convict her. The court affirmed the conviction based on knowledge and intent shown by five extraneous transactions involving appellant and her aunt regarding attempts to borrow money based on the alleged bountiful legacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant's conviction as a party to the offense of theft by deception was upheld, because there was sufficient evidence that appellant and her aunt intentionally misrepresented her aunt's inheritance to the victim, knowing the falsity of their representations based on probate records showing only a slender estate and the inventory of the estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for aggravated sexual assault, enhanced by two prior felony convictions. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction on parole and good conduct time pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 &sect; 4(b) (1986), asserting that the statute was unconstitutional and the jury instruction given thereunder was unintelligible, misleading, and confusing. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that, while it might be difficult for a juror to refrain from applying the parole law after being informed of its possible impact on a sentence, difficulty in following jury instructions did not render the instruction unconstitutional. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(b) (1986) was not an unconstitutional invasion of the province of the executive branch of the government.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(a)(1). The court found that Tex.

The court held that it had not been shown to be an ex post facto law. The court continued that there was no evidence of an act which needed to be explained by reputation and therefore the trial court correctly excluded the evidence offered to show that the deceased was the aggressor in fact. The court continued that an unimpeached witness' testimony could not be given more credibility by other state's evidence but that did not mean that the state could not present more than one witness to relate what had happened. The court also found that when not descriptive of that which was legally essential to the validity of an indictment or information, unnecessary words could be rejected as surplusage.

Defendant contended that the conviction should be reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury concerning the parole laws and because the sentence he received was excessive.

The court determined that defendant had not demonstrated such harm. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of punishments assessed by juries and trial courts if they were within the range of punishment prescribed by statute for the offense, unless the punishments were so plainly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the sense of humankind and thus constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that defendant's punishment was not cruel or unusual because defendant admitted to robbing his victim by using a loaded pistol and by putting her in fear of her life.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect;&sect; 4.02, 4.03 (1986), contending it was error for the trial court to deny his motion to discharge the jury after the prosecutor used a peremptory challenge to remove a black venireman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for delivery of a controlled substance, namely cocaine, of 200 grams or more but less than 400 grams, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect;&sect; 4.02, 4.03 (1986). His sole contention was that the trial court erred in denying his motion to discharge the jury after the prosecutor used a peremptory challenge to remove a black venireman. Appellant was determined to be black by physical characteristics and Hispanic by name. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the prosecutor's striking of the only member of the racial group to which appellant appeared to belong, while not striking a member of the racial group with which appellant was identified by his name, did not constitute the &quot;pattern&quot; of strikes which raises an inference of discrimination. The black venireman's statement that in his mind, the amount of cocaine delivered would not affect the fine that may be assessed as part of the punishment, indicated a bias against the range of punishment provided by statute and was a proper basis for a challenge for cause or a peremptory challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for murder on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence and the alleged unconstitutionality of a jury instruction regarding parole given pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1986). On appeal, the court affirmed. The circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish motive, opportunity, and means, and excluded every reasonable hypothesis other than that appellant committed the murder. The reviewing court did not have to determine whether the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, only that any rational trier of fact could have believed that guilt was so established. The legislature did not exceed its powers when it passed Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4, which required the court to instruct the jury on parole laws. Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11 authorized the legislature to enact parole laws. Merely requiring that the jury be informed what the law is and admonishing them not to use the information in sentencing did not interfere with the court's discretion. Art. 37.07, &sect; 4 did not constitute an ex post facto law because it did not change or enhance the punishment for murder.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that appellant's assault on the police officers was part and parcel of appellant's flight and therefore upheld the admission into evidence of proof that appellant assaulted the police officers. The court held that the legislature did not exceed its constitutional powers over parole when it enacted Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a). The court found that the parole law instructions did not authorize the judicial branch to usurp or interfere with the exclusive authority to determine parole granted to the Board of Pardons and Paroles, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.18, &sect; 1 (1986), and therefore the statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine of the state constitution. The court determined that the required jury instructions presented no irreconcilable conflict because they clearly told the jury not to consider the manner in which the parole law may be applied to appellant.

On April 28, 1983 plaintiff was treated for pelvic inflammatory disease. Plaintiffs claimed defendant's operation was negligent and resulted in the inflammatory disease. The reviewing court affirmed the judgment for plaintiffs in their medical malpractice action against defendant. Plaintiffs' action was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations under Tex.

Defendant never discovered the cause of plaintiff's continuing pain and plaintiff did not learn the exact cause until the 1983 operation. The trial court did not err in excluding evidence that plaintiff had contact with gonorrhea because there was no medical evidence that plaintiff had actually contracted gonorrhea. Defendant's use of silk sutures in plaintiff without medical justification and with plaintiff wanting to retain fertility was evidence of gross negligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated rape. On appeal, appellant argued that the evidence was insufficient to identify him as the perpetrator of the offense and that the trial court erred in giving the jury the instruction set out in Tex.

Appellant further contenmded that he was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury when the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to remove all eligible black venirepersons from the jury. The court affirmed appellant's conviction holding that appellant left his license at the victim's apartment and that she later identified appellant in a picture and in court, thus, a rational trier of fact could have resolved the issue of identification beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further found that the jury instruction referencing parole law did not invite the jury to consider how the parole laws would affect appellant and that the trial court had expressly directed the jury not to consider the topic.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 8 of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of driving while intoxicated in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-1 (1986), on the ground that the results of a blood test were the result of an unlawful search and seizure, and that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was operating a motor vehicle on a public road at the time of the alleged offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in a fatal traffic accident, which was not his fault. An investigating officer smelled a light odor of alcohol on appellant's breath while he was being interviewed, but not under arrest. He admitted he had been drinking. He was injured and taken to a hospital where a blood sample was requested that revealed a blood alcohol level of .16 percent. A second blood sample was drawn by the hospital that revealed a blood alcohol level of .18 percent. Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-1 (1986). On appeal, the court affirmed because appellant's contention that the blood tests used against him were unconstitutional was belied by the fact that the second blood test had not been requested by appellee state and therefore constitutional protections did not apply, even if the first test had bee unlawfully obtained. In addition, the time frame within which appellant testified he had been drinking was sufficiently probative of intoxication while driving a vehicle to justify the jury's verdict that he had been driving while under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for driving while under the influence of alcohol because it was not the result of an unlawful search and seizure since any error in obtaining a first blood sample by appellee state was vitiated by the second sample that had not been obtained by appellee. In addition, the evidence tying alcohol consumption to driving was sufficient to permit a rational inference of guilt.</SPAN></P>

The court first determined that writs of habeas corpus had been allowed to test the constitutionality of statutes. The court refused to determine the ground of error attacking the indictment. The court found defendant did not provide them with any guidance as to why &sect; 47.03(a)(1), was vague. The court found the challenged statute to be sound.

The court found that, while Tex. Prop.

In his pro se motion, and in his testimony at the motion hearing, he expressed his wish for substitute counsel. The trial court found that appellant's counsel of record was capable of rendering effective assistance to appellant and that his reason for seeking dismissal was inadequate. The court held that, on the evidence presented at the hearing, the trial court did not err in that ruling. Appellant's point of error that the jury was erroneously led to believe that an incarcerated person received good time credit that reduced the term of years assessed was not made by appellant's objection at trial with sufficient specificity to preserve error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife went to a movie theatre on a hot, sunny, dry July afternoon and left their dog in the car, which was parked in the direct sun. The car windows were left open approximately an inch and one-half on each side. Defendant was convicted of cruelty to an animal, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. 42.11(a)(4) (1986). Defendant appealed, attacking the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that even though the evidence against defendant was circumstantial, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The court held that by presenting defensive evidence before the court, defendant waived review of the court's denial of his motion for acquittal. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, holding that terms of &sect; 42.11(a)(4) had a meaning which could be understood by a person of ordinary intelligence and gave fair notice of conduct subject to prosecution; hence, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad under either U.S. Const. amends.

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the trial court's punishment phase instructions and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(b) (1986). Defendant contended that the &sect; 4(b) instructions violated the separation of powers doctrine and were unconstitutional as the instructions allowed the jury to speculate on matters not related to deciding proper punishment and were confusing and vague. The state claimed that defendant's failure to object at trial waived any error. The court affirmed the conviction but stated that defendant's statement was sufficient to apprise the trial court of his constitutional objection. The court applied the presumption that the statutory instruction was valid and concluded that the instructions were not an unconstitutional legislative encroachment upon judicial power or an unconstitutional judicial usurpation of executive power. The court held that the protective language given by the trial court was sufficient to preclude any speculation by the jury. The court ruled that the instructions had a clarifying effect and were not vague.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that her indictment was not defective because it closely tracked the wording of the statute, and she should have brought a motion to quash for clarification. The court held that jury argument was not improper because, although the prosecutor continued after an objection with a statement that appellant's credibility was for the jury to decide, he did not bring in new evidence. The court found no reversible error in the prosecutor's comments about appellant's lack of remorse because the jurors had an opportunity to observe her. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 (1981) did not violate due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, or Tex. Const. art.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no fundamental defect in the indictment and also held that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense of sale of a child beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that since the statute was framed in the disjunctive, there was no necessity for the additional averment that the delivery of the child was for the purposes of adoption. Appellant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to prove she offered to accept, agreed to accept, or accepted a thing of value for the delivery of the child. The court found evidence that appellant participated in the transaction by signing the receipt, holding the baby during the deal, making no attempt to remove the child, or call the police, or take affirmative action to prevent the close of the sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to appellant taxpayers' school bond election contest, appellee school district filed a motion to require appellants to post bond under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 717m-1, &sect; 8 (1986). The trial court ordered appellants to post bond, but when they did not do so, the case was dismissed for failure to post bond. The court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The court held that Article 717m-1, &sect; 8 operated to deprive the court of jurisdiction to consider appellants' contentions because appellants neither posted the bond nor appealed from the trial court's order requiring such bond. The court also held that the statute did not deprive appellants of their due process because the statute did not expressly deny waiver of the bond for indigents. The court held that appellants were afforded a hearing on the feasibility of a bond being required, but brought no evidence to show that they were indigent. Moreover, the court held that the judgment was not void because the trial court had jurisdiction over the proceedings and appellants failed to avail themselves of the right to appeal the judgment in the manner provided by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that appellant's prior conviction was not such an essential element of the primary offense of felony escape under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22.011 and 22.021(a)(5) (1986) and sentenced accordingly. Defendant challenged his conviction, asserting that the jury should have been instructed on the lesser included offense of indecency with a child, that it was error to admit the videotaped statement of the child, and that the state's remarks to the jury constituted reversible error. The court reversed defendant's conviction because the admission of the child's videotaped statement constituted reversible error in that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071 (1986) was found to be unconstitutional as a deprivation of defendant's right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court held that the state's remarks to the jury were improper because they were based on facts that had not been admitted into evidence. The court also found that there was insufficient evidence to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of indecency with a child. The case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a conviction for involuntary manslaughter, entered in the 180th District Court, Harris County (Texas), asserting that the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 6b(c) (1986), imposing a jail term as condition of probation, was unconstitutionally vague and disproportionately harsh. Appellant also asserted that the caption of Senate Bill No. 1 failed to call attention to involuntary manslaughter laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his involuntary manslaughter conviction, on the grounds that the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 6b(c) (1986), imposing a jail term as condition of probation, was unconstitutionally vague and disproportionately harsh. Appellant contended that requirements violated U.S. Const. amend. V, VIII, and XIV, as well as Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. Appellant challenged Senate Bill No. 1 for failure to call attention to involuntary manslaughter laws. After appellant pleaded guilty and received a 10-year sentence that was probated for 10 years, the court ordered him to serve 120 days in jail as a condition of probation. Article 42.12, &sect;6b(c) required imposition of a period of detention for offenses under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.05(2)(a). On appeal, the court held that appellant had no standing to challenge the statute's vagueness for lack of an upper limit to incarceration, because he received the minimum period of confinement. The court stressed that the legislature had broad authority in mandating confinement as a probation condition and the court found that appellant's sentence was not unduly harsh, given that there was loss of life.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that the trial court incorrectly held that land meant any portion of a parcel of qualified timberland. The court held that the reference in the applicable statute to that land referred to an entire parcel rather than a portion of the parcel. The court further held that the trial court erred in construing the statute to require the tax assessor to substitute the average per acre appraised value for any part of the parcel that had a lower value. Lastly, the court held that the trial court erred in holding that ad valorem taxes had not been paid in full and that appellants were required to pay the amount billed.

Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 52.171 et. seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner of a percentage of interest in a surface estate sought a proportionate share of one-half of the working interest which appellee State received as consideration for settlement of another case involving oil and gas leases for the estate. The trial court denied appellant's motion for partial summary disposition and granted appellee's motion on all issues. The court reversed, finding that the consideration for the settlement was interest in the oil and gas lease for the estate. Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 52.177 did not bar appellant, as a Relinquishment Act, Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 52.171 et seq., surface owner, from sharing in the proceeds of the settlement and appellant and appellant were to share equally in all bonuses, royalties, rentals, or other consideration paid by the lessee. The court concluded that appellant was entitle to a proportionate share of the settlement of the lawsuit had the other party paid cash to appellee and thus appellant was entitled to a proportionate share of the proceeds of the settlement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, mother and her minor children, brought suit against appellants, grandfather and other relatives, seeking damages for interference with child custody. Appellants sought review and the court rejected every contention. Appellants failed to show that any improper arguments prejudiced appellants. It was not error to permit the use of a deposition at trial, even thought it contained appellants' assertion of their U.S. Const. amend. V rights. The several matters contained in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 36 related to the same general subject and did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 36.02 was not unconstitutionally vague because it was not impermissibly vague in all of its applications. A ppellants engaged in conduct which it clearly proscribed. Classifications within Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 36 were rationally related to a legitimate state interest. It was not error to permit an unsigned deposition to be used at trial because there were no facts that impugned the deposition's reliability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant offender was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and the court affirmed. It was not error to allow appellee state to introduce evidence of appellant's sexual offenses committed with the victim because appellant's trial testimony created a false impression concerning the incident and the state was permitted to present information of extraneous offenses to correct the impression. Moreover, the evidence was relevant to appellant's probation application. Appellee's summation did not ask the jury to speculate about prior sex offenses in determining punishment, and after the court sustained appellant's objection he did not renew a request to instruct the jury to disregard the statement and thus did not preserve the error for review. Appellant's counsel's failure to request court reporting of voir dire proceedings did not harm appellant, counsel's decision not to cross-examine victims was strategic, and thus appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. Finally, the mandate in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (Vernon Supp. 1986), to instruct the jury on parole law did not attempt to grant executive power to the jury and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant offender challenged the judgment of the 211th District Court of Denton County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated assault of a minor, claiming that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2 (Vernon Supp. 1986) deprived him of his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant offender challenged his conviction of aggravated sexual assault of a minor. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Appellant's admission to committing the offense on a different date than alleged in the indictment did not mean that two separate offenses were shown and went only to the credibility of appellant's statement. It was proper to admit a victim's videotaped testimony recorded prior to trial because the trial court reviewed the testimony and determined that the victim was competent and the questions were permissible. But admission of the videotape pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2 (Vernon Supp. 1986) deprived appellant of his right to confront and cross-examine the victim. The statute did not insure fundamental fairness by allowing appellee state to record the victim's testimony in a relaxed atmosphere, but required appellant to subject the victim to the pressure of the courtroom or waive his right to confrontation. Had appellant cross-examined the victim, the jury would have been twice presented with the testimony. Moreover, prior statements should not have been used until the witness had forgotten or given inconsistent testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant offender's conviction of aggravated sexual assault and remanded for a new trial. Statutory law allowing admission in evidence of a child's testimony videotaped prior to trial deprived appellant of his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses because a prior statement was not justified, and appellant would have had to subject the victim to courtroom testimony and present the jury with the testimony a second time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state banking commissioner challenged the judgment of the District Court of Travis County (Texas), which, based on Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 548b (1973 &amp; Supp. 1986), granted appellee cemetery association declaratory and injunctive relief in its action to prevent appellant from reopening prior administrative proceedings and reconsidering its approval of appellee's funeral services plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state banking department rejected appellee cemetery association's application to withdraw accrued interest from its bank accounts consistent with a prepaid funeral services plan that the department had approved in administrative proceedings held in 1981, and the department attempted to reopen the proceedings. Appellee filed suit against appellant state banking commissioner. The trial court granted appellee declaratory and injunctive relief, and appellee sought review. The court directed reform of the judgment and affirmed. It found that new evidence regarding appellee's plan, and new considerations regarding administrative policy, did not entitle the department to reopen prior proceedings and reconsider its approval of the plan. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 548b (1973 &amp; Supp. 1986) neither expressly nor impliedly empowered the department to reopen proceedings for such a purpose. The legislature anticipated that sellers would assume financial obligations in reliance on unconditional department approval. The court directed that the portion of the judgment allowing appellant to reconsider plan approval upon a specific factual showing be reformed accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed judgment in favor of appellee cemetery association for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant state banking commissioner. Statutory law did not expressly or impliedly empower the state banking department to reopen proceedings and reconsider approval of appellee's funeral services plan. The court directed judgment reform to the extent that it allowed plan approval reconsideration upon a specific factual showing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fire department chauffeur sought review of the judgment of the 133rd District Court of Harris County, Texas, which affirmed an order of appellee civil service commission that upheld appellant's indefinite suspension under appellee's rules and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269m, &sect; 5, for committing a criminal act by issuing a check on a closed account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fire department chauffeur was suspended by the chief and appellee civil service commission after he wrote a check on a closed account in violation of Tex. Penal Code &sect; 32.41 (Supp. 1986). The trial court upheld the suspension because it was supported by substantial evidence. Appellant claimed that &quot;substantial evidence&quot; was the wrong standard of review because the rule under which he was suspended was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by appellee. The court held that appellant waived this point of error because he did not make the argument in the trial court, stipulated that the substantial evidence rule applied, and failed to brief the point properly under Tex. R. Civ. P. Ann. &sect; 414(e) (1985). Assuming appellant preserved his claim, the court found no unconstitutional exercise of authority. The rule under which appellant was suspended was consistent with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269m, &sect; 5, which did not require a conviction and provided for suspension if a firefighter committed acts that showed a lack of good moral character or was guilty of a criminal or immoral act. The court affirmed the suspension because it was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the indefinite suspension of appellant fire department chauffeur. The suspension order was supported by substantial evidence. Appellant waived his claim that appellee civil service commission's rule was unconstitutional because he did not raise the issue at trial and failed to brief the point properly. The rule was constitutional because it was consistent with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, Texas Animal Health Commission, sought an injunction to tag and brand the cattle belonging to appellant cattle owner that had been exposed to Brucellosis. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. The court ordered appellant to have his reactor cattle tagged, branded, and moved for immediate slaughter to a slaughtering establishment. Appellant challenged the trial court order, complaining that the trial court reversibly erred by granting appellee's summary judgment which precluded appellant from litigating genuine issues as to material facts relating to defenses and counterclaims that the Brucellosis control program was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial court had not reversibly erred by granting summary judgment to appellee. Appellee had the authority to bring its action pursuant to Tex. Agric. Code Ann. &sect; 161.131 (1982). Despite the fact that Brucellosis control deprived appellant of his most beneficial use of the cattle, it was not, as such, an unconstitutional &quot;taking.&quot; Rather, the program was a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff justices appealed a judgment by the 166th District Court of Bexar County, Texas, which upheld the order of defendant Commissioner's Court of Bexar County.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff justices appealed the affirmation of the order of defendant commissioner's court. Plaintiffs claimed the order abolishing three justice of the peace positions violated Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 65, and equal protection, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. These issues were not preserved for appeal because they were not before the trial court. The court further held that the order did not violate Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 18, because as a matter of law, the trial court's judgment was in accordance with the plain meaning of the statute. There was nothing in the record which indicated that the trial court failed to follow the rules of constitutional or statutory interpretation. Plaintiffs received as much due process and protection as they were due. They clearly had notice of defendant's pre-order hearing and an opportunity to be heard. The U.S. Justice Department concurred with both the redistricting of the five justice of the peace precincts and the elimination of the three justice of the peace positions. There was no evidence that defendant acted arbitrarily, without reason, or in bad faith when it passed the order. The action by defendant did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because there was no evidence that defendant commissioners' court acted arbitrarily when it passed the Justice Abolition Order, the action did not constitute an abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee husband, denying appellant wife recovery for personal injuries suffered by her prior to her marriage to appellee as a result of appellee's negligence. On appeal, the court reluctantly affirmed the decision. Generally, the doctrine of interspousal immunity barred recovery for personal injuries suffered by one spouse as the result of the negligence of the other spouse. While the state supreme court held the doctrine inapplicable in cases of intentional tort, it was clear that it adopted the theory that the immunity doctrine was based on a public policy aimed at the preservation of marital peace and harmony. Although neither courts nor commentators had satisfactorily explained how denying relief to the injured spouse would promote harmony, the court was constrained to follow the unambiguous, if indefensible, precedent.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that a police officer was justified in believing that it was urgent to make the search of a vehicle without a warrant to avoid removal of the evidence. The court also found that the police officer's detection of what was in open view was not a &quot;search.&quot; The trial judge properly included an abstract charge on the law of parties and instructions regarding the law related to confessions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 262nd District Court of Harris County, Texas, which convicted him of murder after a jury found him guilty. Punishment, enhanced by one prior felony conviction, was assessed at 50 years' confinement. Appellant asserted seven grounds of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's murder conviction was affirmed on appeal, with the court rejecting each of his asserted errors. His challenge to the instruction on parole failed because the charge was specifically required by statute and the instruction given tracked the statutory language. There was no merit to the argument that two prospective jurors should have been excused sua sponte on grounds of bias or prejudice to appellant; none of the limited circumstances allowed by statute for such an action was shown. The argument that the trial court should have quashed the indictment was moot because the state dropped the burglary charge. The court held that a mistrial was not shown to be warranted for any reason on the basis of the testimony of two witnesses challenged by appellant. The court disagreed that a hearing was warranted on appellant's competence to stand trial; the record revealed no evidentiary basis or complaint of defense counsel to suggest the necessity of such a hearing. Appellant had waived his final complaint that the jury should have been specially instructed regarding the credibility of a particular witness, because he made no request or objection at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The court noted that appellant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the murder conviction. The court rejected each of the procedural errors asserted by appellant as grounds for reversal of his conviction, holding that some were moot, some had not been preserved for appeal, and others simply lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3d (1986), appellant was placed on deferred adjudication. When appellant drove with a suspended license, the state brought a motion to proceed with adjudication, and appellant was assessed punishment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment to proceed to adjudication because, under art. 42.12, &sect; 3d, that decision was within the sole discretion of the trial court and was not subject to appellate review. The court determined that appellant's motion for a new trial was properly denied because appellant failed to present new extrinsic evidence. Additionally, the court rejected appellant's claim that he had substantially complied with &quot;probation&quot; terms because that standard applied to &quot;probation&quot; that occurred after guilt was adjudicated, and not before, as in appellant's deferred adjudication. The court held that appellant's due process rights were not violated, even if the trial court failed to consider mitigating evidence, because any error would be harmless and appellant failed to rebut the presumption of proper trial court action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that proceeded with adjudication and assessed punishment for the possession of a controlled substance at 60 years per offense. The court held that the decision to proceed with adjudication was not subject to review, appellant's motion for a new trial was properly denied by his failure to produce new evidence, and that any error in the trial court's treatment of mitigating evidence was harmless.</SPAN></P>
