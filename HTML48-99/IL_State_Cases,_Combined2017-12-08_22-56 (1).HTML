</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly before defendant was to be tried for the sexual assault of a nurse, the nurse was murdered. Defendant was convicted for her murder and sentenced to death, but the court reversed and remanded for retrial. Defendant was again convicted and sentenced to death, and the court affirmed the trial court's rulings. There was no error in the trial court's denial of reconsideration of its ruling denying defendant's motions to quash and suppress evidence in the absence of new evidence, as defendant did not raise the issues at his first appeal. Admission of the sexual assault was admissible to show defendant's motive. The arrest was proper, as defendant was not immediately and improperly arrested as he contended, but rather he had agreed to go to the station with officers, and his counsel was told that defendant was not under arrest at that time. Eyewitness testimony was independently reliable to overcome a suggestive photo showing because of the witness's independent recollection, their opportunity to see defendant, and their certainty. There was ample evidence from which a jury could have reasonably found defendant guilty based on eyewitness testimony and defendant's motive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the Appellate Court for the First District of Illinois, which convicted him of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced him to a prison term of 11 years, followed by a mandatory supervised release period of three years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to a prison term of 11 years, followed by a mandatory supervised release of three years. The court allowed appellant's petition for leave to appeal. Appellant contended that he did not receive a fair trial because the trial judge erroneously allowed lay opinion witnesses to testify to matters beyond the scope of their personal knowledge; erroneously refused appellant's tendered jury instruction on aggravated criminal sexual abuse as a lesser included offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault; and used erroneous Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions concerning other-crimes and out-of-court statements by the child-victim to his mother. The court initially concluded that the testimony of the individuals in this case went beyond the scope of lay witness opinion testimony and their testimony was admissible as expert testimony. Through education, training, experience, or a combination of each, the witnesses possessed knowledge that was not common to the average citizen. Further, this knowledge aided the jury in reaching this conclusion. The court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court, which convicted appellant of aggravated criminal sexual assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Johnson County (Illinois) which granted appellee inmate declaratory and injunctive relief in his action against appellant state officials alleging that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3(a)(3), (c), requiring prisoners previously convicted of sexual offenses to submit a specimen of blood for genetic marker indexing prior to their release, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was serving an indeterminate sentence for sexual offense convictions that predated the enactment of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3(a)(3), (c). The inmate was eligible for parole, but refused to provide a specimen of blood required under the statute for genetic marker indexing. The inmate filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Ill. Code Civ. P., 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-701 (1992). The trial court ruled that the sections were unconstitutional because they were retroactive and violated the Ex Post Facto and Due Process clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3(c) was a timing provision rather than an enforcement mechanism. The statute provided only that the inmate was required to provide a specimen of his blood at a certain time, that being prior to his release. The state could forcibly seize a specimen of the inmate's blood. Thus, nothing prevented the blood sample from being taken prior to the inmate's release from prison and the requirement did not impose a delay on an inmate's release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court which granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the inmate on his action against state officials seeking a ruling that a statute requiring him to provide a specimen of blood for genetic marker indexing before his release from prison was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted her of first-degree murder in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(a)(1) and robbery in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18-1(a), denied her post-trial motions for a new trial and judgment non obstante verdicto, and sentenced her to death pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of first-degree murder and robbery and after considering mitigating and aggravating factors pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(c), sentenced defendant to death, finding no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death sentence. Defendant appealed, raising several issues and the court affirmed. The court found that the circuit court's determination that defendant was not arrested at the time in question was not manifestly erroneous, because defendant went to and stayed at the police station for questioning voluntarily. The record contained no evidence whatsoever that if the initial officer entertained the belief that defendant was not free to leave, it was communicated to defendant in any way. The court's review of the record in no way suggested that the conduct of the trial court impeded the selection of an impartial jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it into evidence hearsay testimony that defendant had committed three robberies. Having already determined Illinois's death penalty statute was not unconstitutional, the court declined to reconsider the question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for first-degree murder and robbery was affirmed, along with the resulting sentence of death. The court determined that defendant had not been subject to unreasonable search and seizure, had not been deprived of a fair trial, and that the trial court had properly considered both aggravating and mitigating factors in the imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately convicted of possession of a stolen motor vehicle and possession of controlled substances. On appeal, the convictions were reversed based upon findings that the state failed to establish venue in each case beyond a reasonable doubt. The state sought review and the court reversed the judgments, finding that venue was a material allegation of each offense that had to be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt, along with the other elements of the charged offenses. The court found that such burden was met by the state. The court concluded that the wrong standard was used below in reviewing the convictions because the guilty verdicts could not be reversed unless the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, was so palpably contrary to the verdict, and was so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt of defendants' guilt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and children were attacked at night while they slept. One of the children was raped and the mother was beaten. On appeal the court held that the children's negligence action was properly dismissed, because the police were protected by immunity granted under the Tort Immunity Act (Act). The court found that the children had not established a &quot;special relationship&quot; in order to fall within an exception to the Act. The court reasoned that the children had not shown that they were under the direct and immediate control of the police when the injuries occurred. The court also found that the mother had stated a cause of action for emotional distress. The court reasoned that the police disregarded a high probability that his conduct would cause severe emotional distress. The facts indicated that the officer ignored pleas of the mother to help her children. Finally, the court found that the children had stated a cause of action under the &quot;wilful and wanton&quot; exception to the Act. The court reasoned that this exception did not require the children to prove a special relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency issued a notice to the landowner, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1004(q) (1991), informing the landowner of its potential liability for a release of a hazardous substance on its property. The landowner brought suit against the agency, seeking declaratory relief of the unconstitutionality of para. 1004(q), and issuance of a writ of certiorari to review the agency's record and to quash the notice. The circuit court granted the agency's motion to dismiss the landowner's complaint entirely. The intermediate court reversed as to the count praying for the writ of certiorari. The agency appealed. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court properly dismissed the entire complaint because the claim was premature and not ripe for judicial resolution, and because allowing the landowner judicial review at this preliminary stage in the administrative process would have thwarted the legislative intent and statutory scheme. Pre-enforcement review of the issuance of a para. 1004(q) notice was not available to a notice recipient, regardless of the form of relief sought. The landowner's claim was not a controversy &quot;ripe&quot; for judicial resolution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, beneficiaries of five state retirement funds, filed motions seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent defendant state officials from transferring money from the funds to the state's general revenue fund and an order disqualifying the state attorney general from representing three of the funds. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied the motions. The beneficiaries appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The TRO request was ancillary to a separate mandamus action to restore money to the funds. On appeal, the court held that, despite the conflict between the officials' attempt to divert pension money to balance the budget and the retirement funds' need to regain financial stability, the attorney general's representation of the officials and three of the funds did not prejudice the parties. The beneficiaries could continue their advocacy unaffected by the attorney general's representation of three funds. Whether the circuit court should have issued the TRO was rendered moot when the money was transferred. The court declined to apply the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine and refused to render an advisory opinion because a supreme court opinion on the constitutional issues might influence or foreclose the circuit court from deciding similar issues in the pending mandamus action. The constitutional challenges to the transfer of money first had to be resolved by the circuit court. The circuit court's denial of temporary injunctive relief did not mean it could not reach a final adjudication of the merits of the pending mandamus action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court denying the motion to disqualify the attorney general and dismissed the appeal from the denial of the TRO.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and, in a post-conviction proceeding in the lower court, the defendant filed a petition alleging 33 separate grounds for relief. The lower court denied the petition on the grounds of res judicata, waiver, and lack of merit. The court affirmed the lower court's decision on 32 counts but reversed on the issue of whether the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to adequately investigate and present evidence in mitigation. The court noted that the material submitted by defendant in support of this issue was not part of the record in the original proceedings and represented new evidence and, thus, the issue could not have been raised on direct appeal. The court further held that the affidavits did not duplicate the letters introduced by defense counsel at the sentencing hearing and the persons who submitted affidavits in the post-conviction proceeding were defendant's parents, siblings, children, and friends. The court held that, as a constitutional matter, a capital sentencing hearing requires an individualized assessment of the offense and the offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a 16-month-old child with whom he lived but was not related. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The argument that defendant had no legal duty to act was rejected because defendant's overt acts of starvation, exposure to subfreezing temperature, and interference with the mother's efforts to aid her children resulted in the death. The abuse of the other children was properly admitted to establish defendant's presence, intent, motive, and design and not his propensity for criminal conduct. The interference with the right to represent himself based on law library access was meritless because he failed to complain prior to the trial, and any defect was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Defendant refused all offers of counsel. The State's comments at trial were not preserved as error and were insufficient to invoke the plain error rule. Defendant's conduct was sufficiently brutal and cruel to warrant the death penalty. Defendant failed to tender alternative jury instructions and, therefore, waived his right to appeal. Defendant's other arguments against the death penalty were meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A recipient of mental health services had been found by the circuit court to have been subjected to involuntary admission to a hospital for treatment and had ordered the appointment of appellee guardian for the recipient. The trial court's order further provided that the guardian could not authorize psychotropic medication until certain conditions were met. 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-107.1 permitted a trial court to authorize the involuntary administration of psychotropic medication when the court found by clear and convincing proof, following a full hearing, that the recipient of mental health services was incapable of making the drug-treatment decision on his own behalf and was suffering from one or more of the conditions specified in the statute. The circuit court had refused to do so, reasoning that &sect; 2-107.1 was void as unconstitutional on its face. The court concluded that the statutory provision did not impermissibly overburden the free expression rights of mental health recipients who, while incapable to make a decision in their own behalf, had refused the administration of psychotropic substances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgments of conviction were affirmed, the death sentence was vacated, and remanded. The court held that the trial court's finding of exigent of circumstances was supported by the evidence. It was not unreasonable for the police to believe that swift action to apprehend defendant was necessary. Upon a review of the totality of the evidence, the court held that the trial court was correct in that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant and that exigent circumstances were present to justify making the arrest without a warrant. The evidence of defendant's conviction of voluntary manslaughter should not have been admitted at trial, but it was not so prejudicial as to have denied defendant a fair trial. The court vacated the death sentence because remarks by the prosecutor which were irrelevant to the issue of defendant's eligibility for the death penalty could have improperly distracted and influenced the jurors. The prosecutor's statement's in the closing were misrepresentations of the evidence and the law, were improper and inflammatory, and the court held that defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two distinct cases, the patients sought to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained during medical treatment by the healthcare providers. In one case, the trial court granted the healthcare provider's motion to conduct ex parte discovery, and the lower court reversed on appeal. In the other case, the trial court denied a similar motion, and the lower court affirmed on appeal. On appeal, the court held that the lower courts lacked jurisdiction to review the merits of the trial courts' orders. The court reasoned that pretrial discovery orders were subject to review only on appeal from the final judgment entered in a case. There was no right to appeal such interlocutory orders under Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6. Furthermore, pretrial discovery orders were not made appealable by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 306, 307, 308, 73 Ill. 2d R. 306, 307, 308. The court held that to the extent that &sect; 10(b) of the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 810(b) (1991), attempted to provide for appeals from less than final judgments, it was an unconstitutional infringement by the legislature upon the rulemaking power of the court.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, purchasers and retailers, filed a cross-appeal to have defendants turn over the proceeds disbursed to defendants before the issuance of a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, purchasers and retailers, brought a class action against defendant counties to challenge the constitutionality of the County Motor Fuel Tax Law (Law), Ill.

Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal to have the proceeds disbursed to defendants before the issuance of a preliminary injunction turned over to plaintiffs. The court reversed the judgment against defendants and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court determined that the Law did not violate the special legislation proscription in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. The legislative action satisfied the rational basis test and plaintiffs failed to show that the legislative classification was unreasonable. The court also determined that the comprehensive transportation bill that included the Law did not violate the single-subject rule of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) because its provisions had a natural and logical connection to the legislative purpose. The court concluded that, under the enrolled bill doctrine, the bill did not violate the three-readings requirement of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d).</SPAN></P>

With his attorney present, the inmate chose not to instruct the jury on second-degree murder. He wanted the jury to have but two alternatives: guilty of murder in the first degree or not guilty. It was clear from the record that his choice was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The court further found that the trial court properly considered the inmate's mitigation evidence, for whatever it was worth, and properly concluded that it was insufficient to preclude a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

The husband was arrested for the possession of cocaine resulting from a search of their home, and the state filed a complaint for forfeiture of the real property pursuant to the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, Ill Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1505 (act). Claimant then filed a claim for return of the real property and demanded a trial by jury. The state filed a motion to strike the jury demand on grounds that the act provided that the hearings with respect to all property subject to forfeiture had to be by the court without a jury. On appeal, the court held that the critical inquiry was whether jury trials were provided for in rem forfeiture proceedings at the time the Illinois Constitution was adopted in 1970. In affirming that the act unconstitutionally denied claimant the right to a trial by jury, the court held that the right to a jury trial, in civil proceedings in rem for the enforcement of statutory forfeitures, existed prior to adoption of the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding of the lower court holding that the provision of the Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act (act) denying the right to trial by jury in forfeiture actions violated the Illinois constitution. The court held, however, that because the remainder of the statute was capable of being independently executed, it would excise the invalid section and allow the balance of the act to stand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which ruled that &sect; 5-4(7)(a) of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 805-4(7)(a) (1991), as applied to 15-and 16-year-old minors charged with drug offenses committed within 1,000 feet of public housing, such as defendants, denied minors equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were juveniles, were charged with possessing illegal drugs on city housing authority property. Section 5-4(7)(a) contained a classification based on the location of the crime. A minor charged with committing a drug offense on a public way beyond 1,000 feet of public housing remained in the administration of the juvenile division. However, a minor charged with the same offense within 1,000 feet of public housing was automatically removed from the juvenile division and was treated as an adult. The trial court ruled that &sect; 5-4(7)(a) denied defendants equal protection. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and held that under strict scrutiny, defendants failed to prove that the legislature purposely intended to racially discriminate in enacting the provision. The court held that a facially neutral and otherwise valid law did not violate the equal protection clause simply because the law affected a greater proportion of one race than of another. The court further concluded that a rational basis existed for the classification created by &sect; 5-4(7)(a). The classification was based on the location of the charged offense, which was a permissible distinction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of five counts of murder following a jury trial. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found the defendant eligible for the death penalty based on the statutory aggravating factor of murder of two or more individuals and found insufficient mitigating factors to preclude imposition of the death sentence. Defendant's execution was stayed pending his direct appeal from his convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused and convicted of participating in the murder of five people because of some drug money allegedly owed and then setting their bodies on fire. The trial court sentenced defendant to death. The court rejected defendant's contention that the state engaged in purposeful racial discrimination when exercising its peremptory challenges because 1) the court upheld prosecutor's challenges concerning the person's viewpoints toward the death penalty; 2) unemployment was a sufficiently race-neutral reason for excluding a venireperson; 3) the demeanor of a venireperson also constituted a legitimate race-neutral reason for the exercise of a peremptory challenge; and 4) sufficient evidence was produced at trial to support the jury's verdict. Regarding defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel the court held that because the record did not adequately set forth what defense counsel's testimony would have been it could not resolve this ineffectiveness claim in defendant's favor. Defendant also failed to meet the burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence. The court held that appellant failed to make a timely objection to the state's final challenge as appellant did not object at the time the juror was excluded and allowed both parties to proceed with opening arguments and three state witnesses to testify before sounding his complaint.

The court agreed and reversed and held that &sect; 7-61 applied to all vacancies in nomination except judicial vacancies. Sections 7-7 and 7-61 described only political districts for legislative and executive positions and did not refer to judicial committees for judicial vacancies in nomination.

The appellate court affirmed the order sustaining defendant's motion to quash. The state appealed. The court held that the attorney-client privilege extended to communications between defendant and the psychiatrist to aid in preparation of the insanity defense. Defendant did not waive the privilege by asserting defenses that placed her mental condition in issue. The court concluded that the trial court erred in quashing the subpoenas because the privilege yielded under the peculiar facts of the case. The court held that the nine-year delay between the homicide and the trial was in no way attributable to the state and that barring discovery of the only expert whose inquiry into defendant's mental condition was contemporaneous with the occurrence of the crime obstructed the fundamental truth-seeking function of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions and sentences for first degree murder, burglary, home invasion, and attempted aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant alleged that there were various errors in the administration of the trial, that his burglary conviction was erroneous, that as a result, so was the death sentence, and that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the sentences and the convictions in part. The court reversed the burglary conviction, as defendant was guilty of residential burglary, not simple burglary and the court held that the sentences for the other crimes should have been ordered to run concurrent with the death sentence and modified the sentences accordingly. The court affirmed the other convictions, as the trial court did not abuse its discretion and any errors committed were harmless. Finally, the death sentence was proper, as the erroneous inclusion of burglary among the predicate felonies as aggravating circumstances in support of the sentence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and did not require a new hearing. The court also concluded that the sentence was proper, as the death penalty statute was constitutionally firm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions in part but reversed the burglary conviction, as defendant was guilty of residential burglary, not simple burglary and any errors were otherwise harmless.

Stat. 5/12-16.2(a)(1) (1992)) unconstitutional with regard to defendants, who were charged with being knowing carriers of HIV and transmitting the virus through intimate contact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was charged with being a knowing carrier of the HIV virus and transmitting the virus through intimate contact with another person. One defendant had consensual sex and the other committed rape. In both cases the trial courts found that the criminal statute was unconstitutional and the state challenged the decision. On consolidated appeals, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Neither of the trial courts explained why the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that free speech was not violated because the actions of defendants did not have any connection with free speech. Additionally, the statute was not overly broad or facially vague. Further, the statute did not infringe on the right to intimate association because no such right existed. The statute was sufficiently clear and explicit so that a person of ordinary intelligence need not have to guess at its meaning or application. Also, it provided sufficiently definite standards for law enforcement officers and triers of fact so that its application was not depend merely on their private conceptions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant was entitled to a new hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and, in view of that holding, declined to address the death sentence issues. In reaching its decision, the court concluded that because the record did not show strict compliance with the certificate requirement of Rule 604(d), reversal of that portion of the trial court's judgment denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea was warranted. The court rejected the state's argument that because defendant was not prejudiced by any violations of Rule 604(d), a remand for new proceedings served no purpose.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 16-1(a)(5) (1989), was unconstitutional on its face since it failed to require a culpable mental state. The indictment alleged that defendant knowingly received property explicitly represented as being stolen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because &sect; 16-1(a)(5) of the Illinois theft statute did not require a culpable mental state, it could apply to innocent conduct. He asserted that &sect; 16-1(a)(5) would criminalize the actions of a police evidence technician who took from a police officer for safekeeping the proceeds of a theft that the police officer had recovered and that the police officer gave to the evidence technician with the representation that the goods were stolen. Section 16-1(a)(5) did not bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose; thus, it was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court agreed and affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. Section 16-1(a)(5) was not reasonably related to the purpose of enabling police officers to break up fencing operations because, as written, it subjected innocent persons to punishment. The court also found that the mental states stated in &sect;&sect; 16-1(a)(A) through (a)(C) of the theft statute could not be implied in &sect; (a)(5) because to do so would make &sect;&sect; (a)(A) though (a)(C), as stated below &sect;&sect; (a)(1) through (a)(4), &quot;meaningless surplusage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 716d (1991), after they had participated in a tax sale of property, when they had interests in the property to be sold. The prosecution appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that &sect; 235b of the Illinois Revenue Act of 1939, specifically at Ill. Rev.

The state claimed that the complaints sufficiently tracked the language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 716d (1991) to meet due process requirements. The court reversed the trial court dismissal and remanded, holding that defendants were the class of persons to which Para. 716d was addressed and that the complaints against defendants tracked the language of Para. 716d to meet due process requirements, which did not require specific property descriptions if the property was not an element of the offense, which it was not. The court further held that defendants had no right to acquire property from a tax sale and the owner and taxpayer had a right to redeem the property after the sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal, because defendants' rights of due process and equal protection were not violated by the prosecution and defendants were the class of citizens which was sought to be prosecuted under the statutory scheme, which prohibited persons that had an interest in property being sold at a tax sale from bidding at the sale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, government officials, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which declared unconstitutional that part of Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/501 (1992) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act that provided for a dissolution action stay and restrained the parties to the action from disposing of any property until further order of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed for dissolution of marriage and an action for declaratory judgment alleging the unconstitutionality of Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/501 (1992). The wife asserted that the challenged section deprived her of property without due process of law. The trial court found the challenged section unconstitutional and void. Initially, the court found the wife had standing to bring this action for declaratory judgment. Next, the court found that the effect of &sect; 5/501.1(a)(1) was to restrain each party to an action for dissolution of marriage, in the absence of the consent of the other party or an order of the court, from disposing of any and all property, including that qualifying under the Act for the designation &quot;non-marital property.&quot; The court held that the excessively broad sweep of this section to include a restraint affecting property that could not be considered in any way a marital asset, the means adopted by the legislature, was not a rational means of accomplishing its purpose and violated the guarantee of substantive due process. Hence, the wife sustained her burden of establishing the invalidity of the challenged portion of &sect; 5/501.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed from the decision of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which found that defendant city and officials were not bound to follow the Public Employee Disability Act, 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 345/1 (1992), because it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working as a fire fighter for the city, which was a home rule unit of government. The Disability Act required home rule units of government with populations smaller than one million to continue paying, for a period of one year, wages and benefits to fire fighters who were injured in the line of duty. The city refused the plaintiff's request for continued payment of those items. In response to the employee's request for a declaratory judgment of his rights, the trial court found that the classification of home rule units in the Disability Act violated the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The Disability Act applies to certain divisions of state government, and hence it involved a power or function that was exercised or performed by the state. There were a number of rational reasons that the legislature chose to exclude from coverage home rule units larger than one million persons. As there was no violation of equal protection principles, the city and officials were required to comply with the terms of the Disability Act.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and his execution was stayed pending direct review by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant signed a statement that he was in the store while the clerk was counting the cash receipts. He took some of the money, and, when the clerk accused him of taking the money and threatened to call the police, defendant shot him twice in the head. He fled in the clerk's car, removed the stereo, and set the car on fire. Defendant verbalized the plan to his brother, who wrote it down, and the note was found in the brother's bedroom. The stereo was in his sister's house. The court held that (1) the Jury Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 78 (1991), was not violated and defendant was not deprived of a fair and impartial jury because a juror oath was not required prior to voir dire, and the jurors fairly and impartially rendered a verdict; (2) counsel was not ineffective in failing to timely object to preserve the issue of the juror oath, which was not required; and (3) admission of the note was proper because authentication was established by circumstantial evidence in that the note was found in the brother's bedroom and the note was entitled &quot;Wednesday's plan,&quot; and the crime occurred on a Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipalities challenged an order of the Illinois Appellate Court for the First District. The court affirmed a judgment, which held that the municipalities could not impose toll charges or franchise fees on plaintiff telephone company for laying fiber optic cable underneath public ways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate court affirmed a judgment, which held that defendant municipalities could not impose tolls or franchise fees on plaintiff telephone company for laying fiber optic cable under public ways. The court affirmed. Because no person or entity within any of the municipalities was connected to or had the use of plaintiff's fiber optic cable, the court found that plaintiff was not seeking what normally would have been considered a franchise: a business that sought protection, licensing, and special privileges for using city streets. The court also held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 8-11-2(4) (1987) was entirely regulatory and that it did not permit municipalities to tax the users of public streets or of the wires under the streets. The court further determined that the Telephone Company Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 134, para. 16.90 et seq., granted plaintiff eminent domain over private property and any public ground of the state that was needed to extend telephone poles, wires, cables, or other appliances. The court held that consent for the installation of telephone equipment along or under municipal streets could not be unreasonably withheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate judgment, which affirmed the trial court's decision that defendant municipalities could not impose tolls or franchise fees on plaintiff telephone company for laying fiber optic cable under public ways. The court held that plaintiff was not seeking special privileges for using city streets and that a regulatory statute did not allow taxing the user of public streets or wires under the streets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, sua sponte, recalled the order of the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which affirmed the trial court's order finding petitioner candidate to be the winner of a contested primary but ordered that respondent candidate continue to serve as a judge until the general election in which petitioner candidate ran unopposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the election contest pursuant to Ill. Rev.

The court explained that the appellate court's decision, which essentially allowed both candidates to fill a single judicial vacancy, was unconstitutional because it increased the number of judges in the county, usurped the court's power to appoint persons to fill judicial vacancies if viewed as an appointment, failed to place the proper constitutional limitations concerning judges on candidate if viewed as an appointment, and was made with no legislative appropriation of state funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that (1) even if defense counsel had presented defendant's theory of accident at a trial on felony murder, defendant would not have been acquitted of that offense and thus defendant suffered no prejudice at the guilt phase of the proceedings due to defense counsel's misapprehension of law, (2) defense counsel's failure to rely upon Illinois statutory law in the motion to preclude the death penalty showed a lack of knowledge or understanding of the law, (3) Defense counsel's advice to defendant was attributable to counsel's misapprehension of the law and not to tactics or strategy and such advice, based upon a misapprehension of the law, fell outside the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases, (4) defendant was competent to enter a guilty plea, (5) defendant's claim of an accidental shooting did not vitiate his guilty plea with respect to his felony-murder conviction, as accident was not a defense to that offense, and (5) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to withdraw defendant's plea of guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction stemmed from the rape and murder of a woman whose body was recovered by police. On appeal, the court held (1) the police had probable cause to arrest defendant for the offenses, including evidence implicating defendant for the rape and murder of another woman under similar circumstances. (2) The evidence that defendant raped another woman was properly admitted at trial to show modus operandi. (3) The state proved the corpus delicti of the offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault based on the victim's body and other physical evidence showing that the victim was raped on the night she was murdered. (4) The state established that defendant's confession was made voluntarily and without physical abuse. (5) The trial court imposed reasonable limits on the scope of defendant's cross-examination of two police detectives. (6) The prosecution's closing arguments to the jury were not improper and did not deprive defendant of the right to a fair trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was convicted of murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, residential burglary, and aggravated battery. After hearing evidence in aggravation and mitigation, the trial court sentenced the inmate to death. On appeal, the inmate argued that the judge who presided over the trial and the post-conviction petition erred in denying a petition for post-conviction relief without conducting an evidentiary hearing. The inmate alleged that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the Illinois death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court's denial of the petition, without conducting an evidentiary hearing, was amply supported by the record and state law. The court held that the inmate failed to show that his defense counsel was ineffective because (1) the inmate was not prejudiced by an alleged incompetent's testimony; (2) the defense counsel was in the best position to determine the truthfulness and potential effectiveness of a defense witness; (3) and there was no reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the defense counsel's changed his witness strategy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not entitled to another evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress, that defendant had not substantiated his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, that the court was not collaterally estopped from imposing the death penalty, and that the death penalty statute was constitutional. The issues defendant raised in his motion to suppress were addressed in the previous case. The sentence for a conviction on a previous charge was not binding on a subsequent matter.

The court partially affirmed and partially reversed the lower courts' judgments and remanded the case on appeal. The court reasoned that Wharton's Rule did not bar the prosecution of the conspiracies because the cooperative conduct that was contemplated by the substantive crimes was distinguishable from the complex agreements that supported the conspiracy charges because each of the conspiracies exceeded the simple cooperative conduct that was contemplated in the commission of the substantive crimes. The court also determined that the misdemeanor limitations period applied to the charge of conspiracy to keep a place of prostitution because punishment as either a Class 3 felony or a Class A misdemeanor was possible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person was struck by a driver who had been drinking at the tavern, which was located 30 miles inside Missouri, the next state. The Act provided for jurisdiction over sellers of alcoholic liquor, whether or not they were residents of the state. The trial court did not specify the basis on which it found lack of personal jurisdiction over the tavern keeper and the landlord, but the court affirmed and held that the Act did not apply at all to the landlord, an owner of out-of-state real estate, but only to the tavern keeper. The court noted that there was no evidence that the tavern keeper solicited business from Illinois residents. The fact that an individual consumed alcohol at the tavern and then drove 30 miles to Illinois did not demonstrate sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois to make it proper for an Illinois court to exercise jurisdiction over the Missouri tavern keeper. The requirement that a party must have purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within Illinois was not met. That it was foreseeable that a tavern patron might cause injury in another state was not a sufficient basis upon which to predicate personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellant pension board's motion to dismiss, holding that &sect; 6-210.1 was not unconstitutional. The lower appellate court reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorists claimed that they had petitioned the trial courts for reinstatement of their driver's licenses and the trials were not held in a timely manner.

In a consolidated appeal, the court held that the trial court was required to reinstate the motorists' licenses if the delays in holding hearings on the requests for reinstatement were not caused by the motorists and the state was responsible for the delays. The court further held that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501 (1989) the driver's licenses were properly suspended if the motorists failed to timely request, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 2-118.1(b) (1989), a rescission of the automatic suspension that was based on the motorist driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501 (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the third district appellate court's judgment, which affirmed the order of rescission of the motorist's suspension. The court reversed the fourth district appellate court's judgment, which affirmed the trial court's denial of the motorist's motion for rescission. The court affirmed the first district appellate court's judgment, which reversed the order dismissing the revocation proceedings against one motorist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the convictions rendered by the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Illinois). Defendant had pleaded guilty to murder, home invasion, and aggravated sexual assault. On appeal, defendant challenged the denial of a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, imposition of the death penalty sentence, denial of his right to effective counsel, and use of his home invasion charge for the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death after waiving his right to a jury trial and pleading guilty to murder, home invasion, and aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant contended that his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas was wrongfully denied because his confession was the result of misunderstanding his attorney's advice and he was unaware of the consequences. The court found that there was no objective proof to show that defendant was reasonably justified in his alleged mistake, so there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of his plea withdrawal motion. There was ample support for the trial court's conclusion that the murder was brutal or heinous as indicative of wanton cruelty to satisfy death penalty sentencing requirements. The court found that defendant's assertion that his counsel was ineffective because of testimony given by psychiatric witnesses examined by counsel did not render the attorney's services constitutionally deficient. The circuit court erred by not viewing the home invasion charge as a lesser included offense of the murder charge, but vacation of the death sentence was not required as the trial court had not used home invasion as an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court in all aspects except the home invasion conviction, which it vacated because the home invasion charge was a lesser included offense of the murder charge. The court also vacated the corresponding 60-year sentence. The court directed the court's clerk to enter an order for the execution of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A driver involved in an accident passed a field sobriety test, refused to take a breath test, and was released without citation.

The circuit court granted the driver's request for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 11-501.6 was unconstitutional and enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the summary suspension provisions against any driver in the state. The Secretary appealed. The court held that the driver's amended complaint vested the circuit court with subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that the driver's refusal could not result in suspension because the test was authorized under &sect; 11-501.6, which violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court held that &sect; 11-501.6 unconstitutionally authorized a search and seizure of an individual not charged with any offense without requiring probable cause of intoxication and did not fall within the special needs exception because it was furthered the gathering of evidence for use in a criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Illinois Department of Professional Regulation (department) found that appellee dentist violated the advertising provisions of the Illinois Dental Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2301 et seq. (1987). The Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) affirmed the department's determination, but also held that &sect; 32 of the act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch.111, para. 2332 (1987), was unconstitutional. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department argued that the trial court did not have the authority to enter a stay of the department's sanction. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 32, which required that the sanction remain intact during the pendency and hearing of the judicial proceedings, was unconstitutional. The trial court had the inherent equitable power to issue the stay, and to the extent that &sect; 32 restricted the inherent power of the court, it was unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers. Section 45 (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2345(h) (1987)) of the Illinois Dental Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2301 et seq., prohibited the use of the terms &quot;family dentistry&quot; and &quot;family practice.&quot; The court found that total ban was unconstitutional because the terms could have applied to the dentist's client base rather than to a dental specialty. However, two other terms that the dentist used were misleading. Section 45's use of &quot;false,&quot; &quot;fraudulent,&quot; and &quot;deceptive&quot; were readily understandable by a person of ordinary intelligence and, thus, &sect; 45 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Appellant county electoral board ruled on the objections, holding that the party's candidates were entitled to appear on the ballot, with the exception of two candidates, for which the party had failed to gather the necessary number of petition signatures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The new party fielded candidates for all nonjudicial, countywide offices.

(1989). On appeal from the board's ruling on the objections, the trial court held that the signature shortfall and the party's failure to present judicial candidates resulted in a failure by the party to submit a &quot;complete slate&quot; of candidates as required by &sect; 10-2 of the code and, therefore, all the candidates were ineligible for the ballot. The United States Supreme Court, granting certiorari, made a variety of rulings, but remanded on the issue of whether the lack of a judicial slate of candidates provided a ground for invalidating the new party's entire slate, as was held by the trial court. Upon remand, the court reversed the trial court's judgment on the issue. The court held that the judicial offices at issue were not offices of the political subdivision in which the new party was fielding candidates, and as such, there was not violation of &sect; 10-2 due to the failure to field judicial candidates.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the conviction, the court held that the failure to object to testimony of a jailhouse informant did not show incompetence of counsel when there was no showing of a probability that, but for the errors, the result would have been different. While there was not a sufficient foundation that a scientific test was generally accepted as reliable, its admission was harmless and not prejudicial in the presence of other strong, physical evidence. The court's failure to specifically inform defendant that the vote of one juror would be sufficient to prevent imposition of the death sentence was not error, when defendant was informed that the jury would have to decide unanimously. In establishing eligibility for the death penalty the state did not have to prove that criminal intent for the other crime was formed before the murder. The court was free in the second phase of the sentencing hearing to consider any relevant and reliable evidence in aggravation and mitigation, including the brutal and heinous manner of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court found that claims of misrepresentation were stated with sufficient particularity and should not have been dismissed, but that only one of the claims under the Consumer Fraud Act was sufficiently pleaded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed an elderly couple to death while committing a robbery at their residence with his co-defendant. Although there was no direct evidence linking defendant to the murders, the jury convicted him based upon, inter alia, a corroborated confession to police and assistant prosecutors. The trial court had denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession. Noting that only a preponderance of the evidence was necessary to show the voluntariness of a confession, the court held that the trial court's findings of voluntariness were not against the manifest weight of the evidence where one prosecutor testified that defendant indicated that he was treated fine and given food. Defendant's own testimony also revealed that he was given Miranda warnings at the time of his arrest, and there was conflicting testimony as to whether he had asked for an attorney. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant's gang membership where it tended to establish motive and was not unduly prejudicial. It also ruled that a brief commentary on defendant's post-arrest silence was harmless error given the adequacy of a curative instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by separate complaints with possession of certificates of title without complete assignment in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-104(a)(2) (1989).

Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 11. The court, in reversing, found no due process violation because the requirement of complete assignment was rationally related to protecting the public against fraud, theft, and traffic in stolen motor vehicles. The court further held that the penalty was not so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community and that it was not cruel or degrading.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was tried again, convicted, and sentenced to death in an Illinois trial court. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the State failed to tender to him material exculpatory evidence, that the State knowingly used perjured testimony, and that another suspect had committed the murder. The court affirmed the convictions. Because the evidence in the form of a scientific analysis of a piece of physical evidence did not exist until after the trial, there was no violation of the State's obligation to provide it to defendant. There was no basis in the record for finding that the State suborned perjury, or otherwise knowingly used false testimony because nothing in the record indicated that the statement was false at the time it was made or that the State had any reason to think that it was. Notwithstanding the extensive cross-examination and massive impeachment efforts, the jury concluded that defendant's guilt had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. There was sufficient evidence in the record which made defendant statutorily eligible for the death penalty and there was no constitutional impediment to imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal and in his first post-conviction proceeding. Defendant argued that counsel failed to recognize and assert an error in the State's closing argument to the jury and that counsel failed to assert as error the disparate sentencing between defendant and his co-defendant. The court affirmed. Though the comments were potentially misleading, they were not clear or focused in attempting to shift the sentencing responsibility. Despite the absence of any clarifying instruction at the time the statements were made, the impact was cured by the several jury instructions given during the sentencing phase of defendant's trial and recited in the verdict forms. The prosecutor's argument did not improperly diminish the jury's sense of responsibility to impose the death penalty. Although defendant's prior juvenile conduct was of a less serious nature than his co-defendant's prior criminal conduct, the mitigation was not sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty. Defendant's death sentence was not improperly disparate. Defendant was not prejudiced by prior appellate counsel's performance.</SPAN></P>

The court found that 1) the testimony of a police officer that when he arrested defendant, defendant had brain matter on his face and clothing, was not offered as an expert opinion, but the officer permissibly made that conclusion based on his prior experience; 2) the police's failure to preserve the &quot;white fleshy matter&quot; was at most negligent, and defendant failed to show that the police did not preserve the evidence due to bad faith; 3) references to the victims' familial relationships were not so prejudicial as to deprive defendant of a fair trial; 4) placement of an alternate on the jury resulted did not result in a deprivation of due process, because defendant did not have a right to a jury of his choosing; 5) defendant was less than diligent in trying to locate his witnesses only one day prior to their scheduled testimony, not granting a continuance was proper; and finally 6) the death sentence was not be vacated because the aggravating factor was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the insurer argued that the statutory language required arbitration with respect to questions of damages and liability only. The insureds argued that section 143a(1) of the Insurance Code, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 755a(1), required that all disputes relating to uninsured motorist coverage be determined through arbitration. The court held that the language of &sect;143a, which required the arbitration of any dispute with respect to such coverage, was ambiguous. The court concluded, after having applied appropriate tools of statutory construction, that the legislature intended a narrower reading of the statute. The court held that because of the far-reaching consequences of such a rule, the court would expect an explicit statement of legislative intent before concluding that the general assembly sought to transfer from the courts responsibility for resolving the vast array of issues that can arise with respect to uninsured motorist coverage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state revenue department and officials sought review of the order of the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois), which held that the Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act, Ill.

(1989), was unconstitutional on its face and as applied and quashed the jeopardy assessment against the appellee inmate as a second punishment after the inmate's prior drug offense conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate convicted of drug offenses brought an action for declaratory relief, challenging the revenue department's jeopardy assessment of tax and penalties under the Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act (Act), Ill.

The trial court held that the Act was unconstitutional on its face and as applied and quashed the jeopardy assessment against the appellee inmate as a second punishment after the inmate's prior drug offense conviction. On appeal, the department argued that the Act's provisions were not criminal in nature. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the substantial tax and penalty imposed upon &quot;dealers&quot; under the Act were civil in nature, and the Act was not unconstitutional on its face for failing to provide such &quot;dealers&quot; with the constitutional safeguards which ordinarily accompany a criminal trial. However, the court remanded for a hearing on whether the civil penalty imposed on the inmate subsequent to his criminal conviction was so disproportionately large as to have constituted &quot;punishment&quot; within double jeopardy's multiple-punishment prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision from the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which reversed defendant's conviction for criminal trespass to real property under Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the appeals court's reversal of defendant's conviction for criminal trespass to real property under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 21-3(a). Defendant was standing inside the grocery store gathering signatures on a nominating petition for a political candidate. The store manager asked defendant to leave. Defendant refused and the police arrested him and charged him with a misdemeanor complaint with criminal trespass to land. The trial court found defendant guilty. Defendant appealed his conviction, which was reversed by the appeals court. On further appeal, the court found that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that the store had presented itself as a forum for free expression and that its exclusion of defendant did not violate the constitution. The court held that the store's use of the criminal trespass to land statute to exclude defendant from its property did not violate defendant's rights under the free speech or the free and equal elections provisions of the Illinois Constitution. The court reversed the judgment of the appeals court, and affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and his death sentence for murder, and reversed his conviction for aggravated kidnapping. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion with regard to its decisions; defendant was not denied equal protection and due process; defendant waived a number of issues; and the death penalty statute was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reversal of his murder conviction and death sentence contending that he was found eligible for a death sentence in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. He also claimed that his waiver of a sentencing jury was involuntary and that his confrontation rights were violated. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the death sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. Because the prohibition against ex post facto laws applied to new judicial interpretations of statutory law, the trial court erred in applying a decision on the mental state that rendered a defendant eligible for the death penalty to acts committed before the date of that decision. Defendant's constitutional right of confrontation under U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 were denied where he was not permitted to question a witness concerning his motive to testify falsely. Under Illinois law, a defendant did not have to be expressly advised of the nonunanimity rule, whereby a single juror's vote would preclude imposition of the death penalty, for waiver of a jury at a capital sentencing hearing to be knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' causes were consolidated. The trial court determined that &sect; 5-5-3(g)'s testing procedure represented an illegal search and seizure and denied defendants equal protection. The court held that: (1) The challenged statute was not an unreasonable search and seizure under the provisions of the United States and Illinois Constitutions because it served a preventative purpose. The test required by &sect; 5-5-3(g) represented only a minimal intrusion on the person tested, who by reason of his status as a convicted offender could claim only a diminished expectation of privacy; (2) The testing provision, as applied to defendants, did not deny them equal protection of the laws because the evidence indicated that sexual activity was one of the primary means by which HIV was transmitted from one person to another. It was then appropriate for the legislature to include prostitution among the criminal offenses for which testing would be required. Such a requirement bore a rational relationship to the state interest in combating the spread of AIDS; and (3) The governmental reports and professional studies cited in the parties' briefs were matters that could be considered by the court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court would not admit the reporter until he signed a pledge not to reveal the identity of the juvenile victims. The reporter was admitted on the condition that the identity of the minors would not be revealed. The newspaper appealed. The appellate court held that the trial court order erred to the extent that it prohibited the newspaper from reporting the names of the juveniles. However, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision to the extent that it prohibited the newspaper from reporting the names of the juveniles if the source of the identity was the attendance at the juvenile proceedings. On appeal, the newspaper acknowledged that it did not know the identities of the minors. The newspaper stood to gain knowledge of the minors' identities solely through attending the juvenile court proceedings. The court found that the minor victims did nothing to limit or diminish their constitutional right to be free from governmental and nongovernmental invasions of their privacy. Therefore, the appellate court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed a denial of the merchants' cross-motion for summary judgment and a grant of the village's cross-motion for summary judgment in an action in which the merchants challenged the constitutionality of the village's Sunday Closing Ordinance, and affirmed a defendant's conviction for violating that ordinance in a consolidated case. The court affirmed that judgment on appeal. The court reasoned that South Holland, Ill., Code art. I, &sect; 9-3 was a commodity-type ordinance that was similar to an ordinance that precedent upheld, and that the record showed that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the village's police powers despite the exceptions that it contained. The court also held that the ordinance met the equal protection and due process requirements of the federal and the state constitutions by promoting a legitimate governmental interest, and by striking a reasonable balance between the public benefits of peace and quiet and the ability to purchase necessities. The court further concluded that a review of the ordinance's text revealed that it was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the procedure of a simultaneous jury trial deprived him of a fair trial, that evidence concerning the victim's family was inadmissible, that the trial judge failed to take into account any mitigating factors, and that the trial judge improperly imposed the death sentence based upon a belief that defendant would escape from prison and kill again. The court affirmed. The State's occurrence witnesses were subject to cross-examination before defendant's jury. The record was overwhelming as to defendant's presence and participation in the crimes such that it negated his defense of misidentification and his alibi. The testimony of the victim's brothers concerning the family was relevant and properly presented at trial. The evidence was incidental to other relevant testimony of the victim's brothers and it was not presented in such a manner as to cause the jury to believe it was material. The sentencing judge did not fail to take note of the mitigating factors. Rather, he took them into account and found them insufficient to preclude the sentence of death. Defendant failed to prove any link between the alleged improper statements and the trial judge's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, the state challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Schuyler County (Illinois), which declared unconstitutional certain sections of The Fish Code of 1971, Ill. Rev. Stat. 56/2.4(a) (1989), in connection with a complaint alleging that each defendant had knowingly possessed and captured or killed aquatic life of species protected by the statute for commercial purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendants with knowingly possessing and capturing or killing aquatic life of species protected by the Fish Code of 1971 (Code), Ill. Rev. Stat. 56/2.4(a) (1989), for commercial purposes. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the felony counts, arguing that the Code was impermissibly vague, denied equal protection of the law, and provided a penalty disproportionate to the crimes. The trial court, dismissing defendants' charges, ruled that although the Code was not constitutionally vague, it violated equal protection because it treated a person fishing commercially differently than a person fishing for his own use. The state appealed. On appeal, the court held that those who fish for profit have a stronger motive, monetary gain, than a sport fisherman to illegally take as many fish as possible, and, therefore, the Code properly attacked the problem of commercial fishing when it provided the Class 3 felony in para. 2.4. The court held that the Code was not vague but reversed the trial court's decision with respect to equal protection, concluding that para. 2.4(a) of the Code did not violate equal protection under either the U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Ill Const. art. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the Fish Code was not vague and held that those who fish commercially and for profit have a stronger motive of monetary gain to illegally take as many fish as possible. The court, however, reversed the trial court's decision with respect to equal protection and concluded that the Fish Code did not violate equal protection under either the U.S Constitution or under Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Teacher's unions filed complaints with appellant, the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board (IELRB), against appellee school districts for failure to bargain regarding a reduction in force (RIF) and a teachers' evaluation plan. The IELRB held that the school districts must bargain about the evaluation plan, but not the RIF. The Appellate Courts for the First and Fourth Districts (Illinois) reversed. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school districts argued that their right not to bargain over the evaluation plans was resolved in negotiations and that the RIF was a matter of inherent managerial policy. The court reversed and remanded the order regarding the evaluation plans and affirmed but remanded the RIF case. In determining that the RIF was not a subject for mandatory bargaining, the IELRB did not use the three-part test. Because the application of the mandatory bargaining test required a detailed factual analysis that the IELRB was particularly well suited to examine, the court remanded the RIF cases to the IELRB for further proceedings. The IELRB found that the bargaining history of the parties overcame the school district's allegations that the &quot;zipper clause&quot; constituted a clear and unmistakable waiver of the right to bargain teacher evaluation plans. The extrinsic evidence showed that the parties could not have intended to allow the &quot;zipper clause&quot; to preclude bargaining over a subject which would violate the law if not resolved. The school district did not make any arguments that warranted reversing the IELRB's decision that the evaluation plans must be bargained over.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that an RIF for economic reasons was a mandatory subject of bargaining was affirmed and remanded to the IELRB for further proceedings. The order that the teachers' evaluations plan was not subject to bargaining due to the &quot;zipper clause&quot; was reversed and remanded to the IELRB for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant's eligibility for the death penalty was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court opined that defendant's presentence interview did not violate his right to the assistance of counsel. The court found that there was no indication that defendant was deprived of the meaningful advice of his counsel prior to the interview or that he was forced to proceed with the interview after requesting and being denied counsel. The court held that defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel.

The State argued that defendant was not in custody during the second interrogation. The court affirmed the conviction. Defendant was in custody and was entitled to Miranda warnings because he was not free to leave. A deputy advised him that he could be subject to the death penalty and defendant made an inculpatory statement. Although the propriety of the deputy's statement was questionable, it was not the &quot;functional equivalent&quot; of interrogation. The gang-related evidence was improperly admitted at trial and the statements the State made during closing argument were improper. However, when considering the impact of the evidence under all the attendant circumstances, defendant was not denied a fair and impartial trial despite the erroneous admission of the evidence. The State's comments in closing, although inflammatory, did not amount to substantial prejudice because there was overwhelming evidence in support of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-16(d) (1987). The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Illinois) granted defendant's motion to dismiss and held that the statute violated equal protection. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual abuse at times when he was 19 and 20 years of age. The state alleged that defendant, on two occasions, once when he was 19 years old and once when he was 20, knowingly engaged in acts of sexual penetration with a 13-year-old victim. The statute provided that if the accused was less than five years older than the victim, the offense was criminal sexual abuse, and if the accused was five or more years older than the victim, the offense was aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Defendant argued that the interplay of the sections violated equal protection guarantees of the Federal and State Constitutions. The court reversed the lower court and held that what could have been considered sexual experimentation by a 15-year-old girl and 18-year-old boyfriend, could have been sexual exploitation between a 15-year-old girl and a 19 or 20 year old man. The court held that the purpose of the statute was to protect children from sexual exploitation by adults that were five or more years older than the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">University students, were charged with the violation of the hazing statute, which resulted in the death of an initiate from alcohol poisoning. The trial court dismissed the hazing charges on the grounds it was unconstitutional. The court held the statute was not facially overbroad. The court determined that the hazing statute reached only conduct which recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally resulted in the bodily injury of a person. Next, the court held that the hazing statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to university students' conduct. The court determined that university students were given fair warning of the statute's proscriptions and the statute did not promote arbitrary enforcement. Finally, the court held that the hazing statute did not violate equal protection and the limitation of special legislation. The court concluded that there was a rational basis for limiting the reach of the hazing statute to educational institutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of the murder and armed robbery of an 88 year-old man. Defendant's first trial resulted in a mistrial. On appeal, defendant raised a number of issues relating to the pretrial phase of the trial, the guilt phase, sentencing, and the constitutionality of the Illinois death penalty statute. Defendant contended that double jeopardy prohibited a death penalty hearing in his second trial because his first trial resulted in a mistrial due to the jury's inability to reach a verdict. Therefore, defendant argued that the jury in the first trial, which could have been the sentencing jury, implicitly acquitted him of the death penalty when at least one of its members voted to acquit. The state maintained that the jury in the first trial failed to reach a verdict and that consequently no sentencing jury acquitted the defendant of the death penalty. In affirming defendant's sentence, the court found that because no sentencing hearing took place at the conclusion of his first trial, there was no death penalty acquittal, and the state was not barred from seeking the death penalty in the second trial.</SPAN></P>

Defense counsel established through cross-examination of a state witness that the victim had raped someone who might have been associated with a gang, defendant's position in the gang was such that he was subject to orders from others in the gang, disobeying such an order could lead to being killed, and most prison killings were gang-related. Defendant was convicted for murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that: (1) in terms of defense-strategy, the gang-activity evidence was legitimate even though defendant was not entitled to a compulsion defense where the evidence was relevant as mitigation and its use as mitigating evidence was defense counsel's principle reason for eliciting it; (2) defendant's conviction was the result of a highly corroborated confession rather than the inflammatory gang evidence; and (3) a weak or insufficient defense did not indicate ineffectiveness of counsel where defendant had no defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried for the murder of a police officer. During jury selection, the state exercised peremptory challenges against five black perspective jurors, which effectively excluded all black venire members. Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court allowed the victim's mother and sister to testify as to the impact the murder had on their lives. On appeal, the court remanded for a Batson hearing to determine whether the state had discriminated on the basis of race by its peremptory challenges. The trial court held that there was no evidence of racial discrimination. On remand from the Supreme Court, the court vacated defendant's conviction, finding that the state's explanations for the peremptory challenges were pretexts for racial discrimination because they relied upon the demeanor of jurors and there were inconsistencies in that young blacks were excused while young whites served, and unemployed blacks were excused, but not unemployed whites. The court also held that the victim impact statements were admissible at the sentencing phase under the Illinois Bill of Rights for Victims and Witnesses of Violent Crimes Act.</SPAN></P>

The defendant was sentenced to death. The Illinois Circuit Court of Cook County granted the state's motion to dismiss the defendant's petition for post-conviction relief. The defendant sought review of the judgment of dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was a member of a prominent drug operation. Another member of the drug operation contacted the police and told them that he had information regarding the murder. The informant indicated that the defendant was responsible for the victim's murder and testified to those facts at the defendant's trial. On appeal, the defendant contended that substantial perjury was employed to convict him and that the state's attorney's office knew or should have known of the perjured evidence. The defendant's petition for post-conviction relief specifically stated that the informant was paid by the state's attorney's office to lie at the defendant's trial. Upon review, the supreme court affirmed the dismissal of the defendant's petition. The supreme court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on the allegations of the defendant's petition without conducting an evidentiary hearing. The state established a proper foundation for the admittance of a tape-recorded telephone conversation between the defendant and the informant. The defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim for ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-622 (1987) unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the separation of powers clause of the Illinois Constitution. The court found that the statute did not violate separation of powers clause because it did not require the doctor who must be consulted to exercise a judicial function. The doctor merely certified that in his opinion the action had reasonable merit and this act was essentially no different from testifying at trial to the standard of care and its breach. The requirements also served the same end as Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 137, which required an attorney to certify that pleading were based on fact and made in good faith. The court also found that para. 2-622 was a legitimate procedural rule and did not infringe on the claimant's rights of access to the court's. Finally, where para. 2-622 was rationally related to the legitimate government interest of curtailing frivolous law suits it did not violate Due Process.</SPAN></P>

The patient attached to his complaint an affidavit stating that he had been unable to obtain a consultation with a health professional, and could not obtain one before the expiration of the statute of limitations.

The court held that &sect; 2-622 did not deprive the patient of a constitutionally guaranteed remedy, and thus was not unconstitutional.

The court also found that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury for sentencing. The court noted that defendant was aware that a sentencing jury had to agree unanimously as to the death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Department of Public Aid filed an action on behalf of a minor to establish a putative father's paternity, for reimbursement of public aid provided to the minor and her mother, and for future support for the minor. The putative father filed a motion to dismiss based on a settlement agreement entered in an earlier paternity action filed against him by the mother. The court determined that the settlement order and dismissal entered in the earlier paternity action did not bar the subsequent action, and held that equal protection of the law would be violated if a right to seek support from their parents was denied to nonmarital children where no marital child was barred from seeking support by settlements existing between the parents. The court ruled that the Illinois Parentage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1451 et seq. (1989), specifically Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with operation of a motor vehicle while in possession of an intoxicating liquor and driving while under the influence of alcohol. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss based on the theory that the statutes he was charged under were vague. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the state's charging of defendant under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 18b-108 did not violate the equal protection clause under the Fourteenth Amendment because the state treated all tractor truck drivers differently than regular automobile drivers. Furthermore, the differing punishment for tractor truck drivers did not violate the equal protection clause. The court found that defendant had no standing to challenge Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 18b-105 because he was not directly affected by it. The court ruled that the trial court erred in its finding that the statutory scheme under which defendant was charged violated due process rights. The court held that Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand to comply with directives of the Supreme Court of Illinois, defendant, the Legislative Redistricting Commission, held expedited hearings in regard to the redistricting map it had submitted and another proposed remedial redistricting plan submitted by certain intervenor-plaintiff voters. The maps were submitted for judicial approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute arose out of the submission of the redistricting map by the Commission and another map submitted by certain voters. The court concluded that the Commission had complied with the procedural and substantive directives of its earlier opinion and Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3. The court found that the Commission had heard testimony by experts on behalf of the parties, and reviewed affidavits filed on behalf of the parties, as well as voluminous documents. The court held that after reviewing all of the evidence submitted, it found that both plans were similar regarding compactness. However, the Commission map met all of the requirements of the four-prong test and a map submitted by the constitutionally mandated Commission was valid unless it was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In finding the map valid, the court did not judge the credibility of each expert, but rather relied on the statistics provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the map submitted by the Commission and ordered that the State Board of Elections establish the boundaries in accordance with the map.</SPAN></P>

Based on its review of four requirements for a valid redistricting, the court determined that both plans met the constitutional compactness requirement. However, the court found that only the commission's plan satisfied the other three requirements, which included substantially equal population in each district, provision of adequate representation of minorities and other special interests, and political fairness.

A passenger in the car identified the defendant as the offender. The defendant raised a number of issues concerning the guilt-innocence phase of the proceedings, including insufficient evidence of the corpus delicti of the offense, that his statements were coerced and thus involuntary and inadmissible, challenged the jury selection, argued the prosecutor's comments were improper, asserted there were restrictions on cross-examination of the witness, stated the trial court erred in denying a request for mistrial due to a spectator's outburst, and challenged the prosecutor's closing argument. The defendant also raised challenges to the capital sentencing hearing. The court held that the evidence established that the defendant shot and killed the decedent in cold blood in an aborted attempt at armed robbery. As demonstrated by the state's aggravating evidence, the defendant had an extensive history of violent criminal activity. The defendant offered little evidence in mitigation. The court concluded that the defendant's sentence was not excessive, or inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--1(a) (1985), and aggravated criminal sexual assault. The jury found that he was eligible for the death penalty under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--1(b)(6) (1985), and further found that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude a sentence of death. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) thus sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the court rejected defendant's contentions 1) that the evidence established that he was legally insane; 2) that if not insane, he should have been found guilty but mentally ill; 3) that the prosecutor's improper jury argument required a reversal; and 4) that the prosecutor's reference to the likelihood that defendant would commit a future murder was not supported by the evidence. The evidence in the record supported the jury's finding that defendant failed to prove his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence because the sole psychiatric expert to testify at trial unequivocally stated that defendant was attempting to fake insanity. The evidence that defendant was a sadist and suffered from an antisocial personality disorder did not compel either an insanity or a mentally ill verdict. The prosecutor's statement to the jury that &quot;you don't sentence him&quot; was improper but when viewed in context did not diminish the jury's sense of responsibility in determining the appropriateness of defendant's death sentence. The psychiatric expert testified that defendant told him that his &quot;purpose in life&quot; was to kill and that, should he be released, he would kill again.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court that sentenced defendant to death. The court directed the clerk of the court to enter an order setting Tuesday, March 10, 1992, as the date on which the sentence of death entered by the circuit court was to be carried out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Illinois), which held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, &sect; 3 -- 707 (1989) violated appellee driver's right to equal protection of the laws. Appellee was issued a traffic citation charging him with operating an uninsured motor vehicle in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue for the court was whether &sect; 3 -- 707 of the vehicle code was constitutional. The driver argued that &sect; 3 -- 707 violated the equal protection clause because it discriminated against the working poor, and violated the U.S. Const. amend. VIII because the $ 500 minimum fine for a violation was excessive. The court disagreed and found that &sect; 3 -- 707 neither denied the driver equal protection of the laws, nor mandated an excessive fine. The statute did not violate the equal protection clause of either the United States Constitution or the State of Illinois Constitution because no classification was created based on wealth. There was no doubt that the $ 500 fine for violating the mandatory liability insurance requirement had a much greater financial impact on those persons who were the working poor, but this disparity in economic impact did not give rise to an equal protection violation. The $ 500 minimum fine set out in &sect; 3 -- 707 was not cruel, degrading, or so wholly disproportionate to the offense committed as to shock the moral sense of the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the circuit court that held that the vehicle code was unconstitutional and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held the gang-transfer provision, Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the gang-transfer provision, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 805-4(3.1) (1989), of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 801-1 et seq. (1989), plaintiff state moved to prosecute defendant minor under the criminal laws. When the circuit court found para. 805-4(3.1) unconstitutional, review was sought, and the court reversed. The court held para. 805-4(3.1) had not violated the separation of powers because it neither deprived the juvenile court of jurisdiction nor infringed on the judiciary's powers. The court also held para. 805-4(3.1) had not violated double jeopardy because a transfer hearing was not tantamount to an adjudication as findings made during the hearing were not dispositive of guilt. Furthermore, the court held para. 805-4(3.1) had not violated equal protection because its aim was at decreasing gang violence and thus, was reasonably related to a legitimate governmental interest. Finally, the court held para. 805-4(3.1) had not violated procedural due process because there was no risk of a deprivation of a minor's interest in avoiding prosecution as an adult through the use of para. 805-4(3.1)'s procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois), which affirmed the trial court's judgment that required defendant to register as a habitual child sex offender pursuant to the Habitual Child Sex Offender Registration Act, Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal sexual assault under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-13(a)(3). The lower court affirmed the trial court's decision that required defendant to register as a habitual child sex offender pursuant to the Habitual Child Sex Offender Registration Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 221 et seq. (1987). The court held that the act was not cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. It further held that the act did not deny defendant equal protection or due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court found that the statutory duty to register was neither imprisonment nor a fine and did not impose any restraints on defendant's liberty or property. Thus, such a duty was not punishment. The court held that the act did not arbitrarily differentiate among various sex offenders because the legislature was concerned with the direct victimization of children not child pornographers or those who used children for prostitution. Finally, the court held that the omission of the certification order was merely an administrative oversight that had no effect on defendant's substantive rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision that defendant was properly required to register as a habitual child sex offender pursuant to the Habitual Child Sex Offender Registration Act (act). The court found that the act was designed to aid law enforcement agencies by requiring habitual child sex offenders to register with the local law enforcement authorities whenever such offenders moved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first conviction in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, for murder, aggravated kidnapping, and rape was reversed after rehearing, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. He was convicted after a second jury trial and again sentenced to death, and the sentence was stayed pending his mandatory direct appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital murder, and his conviction was reversed based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. His conviction and sentence after a second trial was automatically appealed. In affirming both the conviction and sentence, the court ruled that the death penalty statute and the procedure for determining eligibility for the sentence were constitutional. The prosecutor's discretion in seeking the death penalty was proper, as it was exercised dependent upon whether the requisite elements for death sentencing existed, and further guided because it was made at the conclusion of the trial. Tactics used by counsel, such as the waiving of an opening statement and an admission of the horrendous nature of the crimes, were legitimate strategy, and not ineffective assistance. The issue of discrimination against black jurors being excluded was determined by considering whether a prima facie case was established by a pattern of strikes against blacks, a disproportionate use of peremptory challenges, or whether excluded blacks were a heterogeneous group sharing race as their only common characteristic, as well as the composition of the venire and the race of the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and death sentence were affirmed, as the death penalty was not unconstitutional, and represented an individualized determination on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, attempted murder, armed robber, residential burglary, and home invasion. He was sentenced to death in connection with the murder charge, 60 years' imprisonment on the attempted murder, 30 years' imprisonment for armed robbery and home invasion, and 15 years' imprisonment for residential burglary. On appeal, he raised several arguments including a defense of voluntary intoxication and prosecution's purposeful racial discrimination in the selection of jury members. The court concluded that defendant's defense of voluntary intoxication was wholly without merit in view of the evidence of his state of mind that was presented in the form of his own statements and the testimony of others. Defendant had also failed to make the prima facie case of purposeful racial discrimination on the part of prosecution that was required under Batson in order to challenge prosecution's use of peremptory challenges, so his Batson argument was determined to lack merit. The court further determined that all other errors asserted by defendant were harmless and did not compel reversal. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment of conviction and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, pursuant to a plea of guilty, of three murders and was sentenced to death for each murder following a sentencing hearing before a jury. On direct appeal, this court affirmed all three of defendant's convictions and two of the death sentences. The death sentence for the third murder conviction was vacated and the cause remanded for imposition of a sentence other than death. Defendant's new counsel filed a second petition for post-conviction relief, which was the subject of this appeal. Defendant appealed, and the court held that defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at the plea proceedings or at the capital sentencing proceedings. Because defendant's trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective, defendant was not prejudiced by his appellate counsel's failure to challenge the competency of trial counsel on direct appeal. Even if defendant's appellate counsel had raised the ineffective-assistance issue on direct appeal, this court would have rejected the claim, as the post-conviction court did. Neither attorney's actions rose to the level of incompetence and prejudice necessary for defendant's requested relief.</SPAN></P>

Appellant Department of Transportation (DOT) denied the application based upon recently enacted flood control legislation, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 19, para. 18g (1989). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) held that the flood control legislation was unconstitutional. The DOT challenged the circuit court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The flood control legislation, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 19, para. 18g, prohibited all new residential construction in a 100-year floodway. The landowner argued that &sect; 18g was unconstitutional as it applied to her properties and that the court had to balance the individual hardships imposed on her against the benefit to be gained by the public. The DOT counter argued that the landowner's challenge was a facial attack on &sect; 18g and that no balancing of interests was required. The court agreed with the DOT and held that the prohibition under &sect; 18g was without exception and was applied in a completely nondiscriminatory manner. Further, the court found that &sect; 18g was rationally related to several legitimate state interests and provided a reasonable basis for the prohibition of new residential construction in the 100-year floodway. The court found that in addition to the interest of reducing flood damage &sect; 18g would: protect the health and welfare of those who would live in the new houses; reduce the expenditure of public funds; and limit the extent of emergency relief services required by the periodic inundation of flood waters.</SPAN></P>

During his trial, defendant pled guilty to all charges. The trial court sentenced defendant to death for the murders and two consecutive 60-year sentences for the aggravated criminal sexual assaults. Defendant contended that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because the trial court failed to admonish him that he could plead guilty but mentally ill.

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences and set a date for the death sentence to be carried out. The court held that the trial court's admonishments were proper. Defendant's opening statement indicated that he planned to deny that he committed the charged offenses and not that he planned on alleging the affirmative defense of insanity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought direct review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Stephenson County (Illinois), which declared &sect; 110 -- 6.2(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110--6.2(b) (1989), concerning post-conviction detention, to be unconstitutional. Defendant, convicted of making unlawful deliveries of a controlled substance, remained free on bond pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction and release on bond pending appeal, the state contended that &sect; 110 -- 6.2(b) was constitutional because the legislature considered the issue of prison overcrowding when it passed the provision into law and because it did not infringe upon a defendant's right to appeal. The circuit court sua sponte declared the statute unconstitutional on grounds that it was not practical to house all those individuals appealing orders of conviction and sentences, and the statute violated due process. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that the statute was unconstitutional because there was a conflict between the requirements of the statute and the terms of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 609(b), 134 Ill. 2d R. 609(b). In so holding, the court reasoned that the word &quot;shall&quot; as used in the statute to describe the court's duty with regard to bond of a person found guilty imposed a mandatory requirement upon the judiciary that irreconcilably conflicted with the permissive language contained in Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 609(b), which provided that persons &quot;may&quot; be admitted to bail at the discretion of a judge of the trial or reviewing court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant agreed to answer questions posed by a police officer en route to the police station. The officer learned whom defendant killed and when the incident occurred. Defendant later refused to sign a written statement of his confession after initially agreeing to do so. Subsequent to his confession, he was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and one count of armed violence. The court affirmed the convictions, finding that the confession was corroborated by physical evidence of the corpus delicti, and by the testimony of the police officers. The trial court properly admitted into evidence defendant's written confession, which was found to have been made voluntarily and knowingly. The jury weighed all the evidence and found defendant guilty of murder. Defendant failed to establish that his attorney's representation was deficient and that he suffered substantial prejudice as a result of these deficiencies. Also, the record did not reflect that defendant requested other counsel to represent him. The prosecution's closing argument was not prejudicial, since the defendant's version of the occurrence differed considerably from that given by witnesses for the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

However, the inevitable discovery doctrine justified the admission of certain evidence. The record did not indicate that the prosecutor used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury. The state was properly allowed to use tape recordings as evidence that defendant committed the crimes for which he was charged.

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-104(b)(1) (1987), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the basis that &sect; 4-104(b)(1) was unconstitutional because it created a felony offense with felony penalties without requiring any unlawful purpose, knowledge, or intent and thus violated his due process rights. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that &sect; 4-104(b)(1) was not unconstitutional because it did not prescribe felony penalties for absolute liability offenses. The court found that due to the lack of a clear legislative intent and the severe penalties applicable to violators of the two charges, under para. 4--104(a)(1) and para. 4- 104(a)(2), were not absolute liability offenses, and that, according to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 4-3(b) (1987), when a statute neither prescribed a particular mental state nor created an absolute liability offense, then either intent, knowledge, or recklessness applied. The court ruled that knowledge was the appropriate mental element for the state to prove that defendant possessed the certificates knowing that he did not have authority or knowing it was without complete assignment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After collection of evidence from a crime scene where the victim was raped and stabbed to death by an intruder, defendant was charged with murder, Ill.

The jury found defendant eligible for the death penalty after the trial court instructed the jury that it could find defendant eligible if he committed the murder in the course of a residential burglary. However, residential burglary was not one of the predicate offenses listed in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9(1)(b)(6) (1985), which allowed for the death penalty in certain situations. The prosecution argued that the error was waived because defendant failed to object. However, the court found plain error, mandating resentencing.

Defendant argued that the state's repeated use of his post-arrest silence during its case in chief, on cross-examination of defendant, and during rebuttal violated the principle that a defendant's post-arrest silence will not be used to discredit an exculpatory story offered at trial. The court agreed. However, defendant failed to object at trial and in a post-trial motion. Thus, the issue was waived and the plain error doctrine did not apply. Defendant argued ineffective assistance of counsel on several issues. The court held that defendant was not sufficiently prejudiced by any actions or inactions by his counsel to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a judgment from the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which reversed defendant's conviction on four counts of violating the Illinois Dangerous Animals Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 8, para. 240 et seq. (1987) on the grounds that the act was unconstitutionally vague on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of life-threatening reptiles in violation of the act. He had a 4-foot alligator, a 7-foot boa constrictor, and two 15-foot pythons. The appellate court reversed, holding that the act was unconstitutionally vague on its face. On appeal by the state, the court reversed. Although the act did not contain any criteria for determining which reptiles were life-threatening, the court held that the ambiguity did not render the act unconstitutional on its face. The term &quot;life-threatening&quot; was sufficiently clear to establish a standard of conduct. The court disagreed with defendant that the reptiles' individual temperaments should be considered. The determination of whether it was reasonably possible that an animal would attack humans had to be made on a species-wide basis. The court held that the trial testimony showed that the pythons were life-threatening. However, the act was too ambiguous to permit conviction for possession of the seven-foot boa constrictor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder by the Circuit Court of Edgar County (Illinois). While the original conviction was awaiting review, defendant filed a post-judgment petition, attacking his conviction and his death sentence. The circuit court denied the petition and defendant appealed. By order, the appeal of the post-judgment petition was consolidated with the pending direct appeal of defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a codefendant were indicted for murder. Defendant's motions for a change of venue and to sever his case were granted. The same jury that convicted defendant found that he was eligible for the death penalty and further found that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude a sentence of death. Although defendant relied on out-of-court inconsistent statements made by witnesses, those remarks were not considered on review, as they were never entered into evidence. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. All of the defendant's allegations of weakness in the state's case were made known to the jury. The testimony of an accomplice could conceivably have been enough to sustain the conviction, as the jury could have found her to be credible. Finally, because the state offered plausible explanations for all evidentiary inconsistencies and shortcomings, and because the jury was made aware of such infirmities, the court held that sufficient evidence was produced for a jury to hold defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction and sentence of death. The court also affirmed the circuit court's denial of defendant's petition for a new trial and directed the clerk of the court to enter an order setting the date on which the sentence of death was to be carried out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff department of transportation challenged the judgment of the Appellate Court for the Third District (Illinois), which reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had denied defendant landowners' motion to dismiss the department's eminent domain proceeding. The appellate court found that the department did not establish, by competent evidence, a prima facie right to take a fee simple interest in land using a quick-take procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court approved the department's complaint for condemnation under the department's power of eminent domain and granted the department fee simple title to the existing Route 34 right-of-way and the fee simple title to strips of land adjacent to Route 34 so the highway could be widened. Defendants argued and the appellate court agreed that the department failed to prove a prima facie case giving it the right to obtain the underlying fee to Route 34 because no evidence was produced which showed that it was necessary to acquire the fee interest to that portion of the highway which had already been dedicated. On further appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the trial court's decision and held that the department satisfied its prima facie burden of proof when it introduced into evidence Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 121, par. 4 -- 501, which specifically authorized the department to acquire the fee simple title to the disputed land. Because the legislature determined that the department could acquire the fee simple absolute, the court held that there was no showing the department manifestly abused its authority or its discretion by acquiring the underlying fee to Route 34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court, denied defendant bank's petition for cross-relief, and affirmed the decision of the circuit court that had held that the department had made a prima facie showing of the necessity to take title to the disputed land in fee simple.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county treasurers brought an action against the revenue director to compel him to pay a salary increase as mandated by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 36, para. 4.6 (1987). The law went into effect two days after the treasurers' election. The trial court found for the revenue director, holding that Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(b) (1970) barred a mid-term increase in salary. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that although the statute used the term &quot;stipend&quot; and the constitutional provisions spoke only of &quot;salaries,&quot; there was no difference between the two. The statute would have served to increase the treasurers' salaries during their elected terms of office, which the constitution forbade. The court also did not accept the treasurers' allegations that the raise was justified because additional duties were added to the treasurers' offices. No evidence was offered in support of the argument, and regardless, such a raise was still unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the governor, state agencies, and state officials, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Bureau County (Illinois), which held that &sect; 4 of the Illinois and Mississippi Canal State Park Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 105, para. 482d (1987), violated Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2; art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970). The action by plaintiff local government entities sought relief from the obligation to maintain bridges under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the state accepted title to the canal from the United States and created a park, it assumed responsibility for the bridges that connected with state highways and imposed responsibility for the remaining bridges on the local governments that were responsible for maintaining the roads that connected with those bridges. The local governments claimed that &sect; 4 of the Act was unconstitutional. The circuit court ruled in favor of the local governments, and the court reversed on appeal. There was no equal protection violation because, while the local governments identified a class to which they alone belonged, there was a rational basis for the classification. As a result of the United States' assumption of bridge maintenance, plaintiffs for many years were not responsible for maintaining the bridges. There were no other governments situated similarly because no other governments had the United States unburden them of their bridge maintenance duties but later withdraw the benefit. Section 4 was a special and local law, not a general law, but it was constitutional where it did not have the effect of according a special privilege to some local governments that it denied to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that held that a section of the Act that required the local governments to maintain bridges in the park was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs also sought that the court declare the legislation constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Public Act 86--27 raised the amounts that were paid annually for various leadership positions in the General Assembly. The increase was to be applied retrospectively to plaintiffs' current terms. Plaintiffs contended that the additional amounts paid to institutional officers of the General Assembly were not salary and could be increased without constitutional limitation. The court held that the legislation violated the provision in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11, which prohibited a change in a legislator's salary during the term for which he was elected. The court held that the word &quot;salary&quot; encompassed all forms of compensation paid to public officials for performing the duties of office. The fact that institutional officers in the General Assembly were paid an additional amount above the base amount paid to all other legislators made it no less a salary. Though the court agreed with plaintiffs that members of the General Assembly could receive greater compensation because of additional duties, the pay increase was an additional remuneration for the additional duties assigned to legislators and was therefore, subject to the restrictions contained in art. IV, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff principals, a superintendent and registered voters in the City of Chicago appealed the ruling of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) which denied their motion to voluntarily dismiss their complaint, but which granted summary judgment to defendants, in an action concerning the constitutionality of the Chicago School Reform Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the Chicago School Reform Act violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions because it denied an equal vote in local school elections to large portions of the electorate. Plaintiffs also contended that by eliminating tenure for principals and subdistrict superintendents and substituting four-year contracts, which may nor may not be renewed, the legislation unconstitutionally impaired the contract rights vested in them. Under the preceding statutory law and policy of the Chicago board of education, principals and subdistrict superintendents had permanent tenure. Plaintiffs also contended that this new condition of employment deprived them of property without due process of law. The court held that under the circumstances, it could not accept the contentions of defendants and the holding of the trial court that the disputed system did not violate the one person, one vote constitutionally mandated by the Supreme Court. Therefore, the court reversed the decision of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the circuit court which granted summary judgment for defendants and denied plaintiffs' motion to dismiss in an action concerning the constitutionality of the Chicago School Reform Act. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional in that it denied equal protection to its constituents.</SPAN></P>

The jury determined that defendant was eligible for the death penalty and, and considered the mitigating and aggravating evidence and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, the court held that (1) the felony murder convictions were vacated because defendant could not be convicted of more than one murder from the same physical act, (2) prospective jurors were properly excused because their views on the death penalty would substantially impair the performance of their duties, (3) defendant's alcoholism, emotional problems, and disturbed childhood were relevant but did not require that the death sentence be reduced to imprisonment, and (4) the jury's weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors did not assign the burden of proof to defendant or state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and found guilty of deviate sexual assault, aggravated indecent liberties with a child, and unlawful restraint. He filed a motion to quash his arrest and to suppress evidence arising from two separate incidents of sexual assault on minors, which was denied by the trial court. The Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial, and the state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state offered testimony that the defendant was given Miranda warnings before questioning, and approximately 10 minutes later, had made an incriminating statement regarding an assault of a minor boy. Based on that testimony, the detective considered there was probable cause to arrest the defendant. The state contended that after the defendant was given his Miranda warnings a second time, he made incriminating statements concerning another sexual attack on minors. The state contended that the subsequent statement given by the defendant was voluntary when, after being given Miranda warnings and without being subjected to the procedures of arrest, the defendant made incriminating statements. The court found that the defendant was arrested without probable cause upon the stopping of his car and the attendant events. The evidence showed that the officer told the defendant that he would have to go to the station to retrieve his license; and he felt compelled to go. He was not told that he was under arrest. The court further concluded that the giving of Miranda warnings alone was not sufficient to purge the taint of an illegal arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment that the defendant was arrested without probable cause and was seized in violation of rights under the U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that defendant did not waive the issue regarding the constitutionality of the statutory penalties by failing to raise it in the circuit court because the challenge could be raised at any time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee loan defaultees brought a class action against appellant Illinois State Scholarship Commission challenging their actions concerning student loan collection and the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 30--15.12. (1988). The court affirmed in part the lower court's grant of summary judgment to appellees, vacating only its order to grant appellees interest on attorney's fees as improper under the Civil Practice Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2--1303 (1987). The court rejected appellants policy of collecting loans exclusively from one county, finding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 30--15.12, the statute appellant relied on in creating this policy, was arbitrary and unreasonable and violated due process. The court noted that by forcing appellees to file collection actions in a distant forum where no compelling governmental policy existed to justify those actions, appellants had denied appellees right of access to the courts.

The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Illinois) found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 61, para. 3.21 (1987) was unconstitutionally vague, and the state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the offenses with which he was charged, but determined that para. 3.21 was unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;engaging in the business of taxidermy&quot; was capable of several meaning. The trial court dismissed all three counts of the information, noting that the unlawful possession of protected animals offense alleged in count I of the information was predicated on a violation of para. 3.21, and that the remaining two counts also alleged a violation of that provision. The state appealed. In reversing the trial court, the court observed that in the absence of a statutory definition indicating a different legislative intention, the court would assume that statutory words had their ordinary and popularly understood meanings. To sustain a facial challenge the challenger had to demonstrate that the law was impermissibly vague in all of its applications. The court then concluded that the statute provided an individual with ample notice that any conduct which fell within the range of activity under the commonly understood meaning of taxidermy must be performed pursuant to the dictates of the statute.</SPAN></P>

For four years, the inmate received annual parole hearings; however, after an amendment to para. 1003-3-5(f), the board scheduled the next parole hearing date in three years, based upon a finding that it was not reasonable to expect that the inmate would be granted parole at an earlier date. The court affirmed the finding of unconstitutionality of the amended statute because of its ex post facto application. The court found that the inmate suffered a disadvantage by the termination of annual parole hearings. Moreover, the fact that the amended statute required special findings and that Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 1610.100(a)(2) (1985) permitted an interim hearing did not sustain application of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-3-5(f) (1988 Supp.) The court reversed the granting of a new parole hearing because the board's reason satisfied the inmate's due process rights. The court found the reason for denial of parole was sufficient because the board specifically considered the inmate's conduct and not merely the statutory offense for which he was convicted. Thus, an immediate parole hearing was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendatory Act, among other things, divided the First Judicial District into five subdistricts and provided that certain circuit court vacancies be filled by appointment. The bar claimed that certain vacancies should not have been placed on the ballot. The court refused to issue the writ, holding that the amendatory Act's subdivision of the First Judicial District for purposes of electing appellate judges was unconstitutional. Although the Illinois constitution provided for subdivision of circuit courts and was silent as to subdivision of appellate courts, the court found that the history of the constitution's judicial article indicated that the First Judicial District was to remain a single, undivided district for the selection of both supreme and appellate judges. The provisions of the amendatory Act with respect to the First Judicial District as to both appellate and circuit court judges were a result of compromise and, thus, intertwined so that the provisions could not be severed. The court held that the challenged elections were proper, except for that of an additional circuit court judgeship created by the amendatory Act, which was held null and void.</SPAN></P>

The drug manufacturer raised several issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The drug manufacturer contended that the settlements constituted a release that discharged all remaining defendants. In addition, the drug manufacturer charged that there was no evidence of proximate cause, the damages awarded were excessive, and there were several grounds for reversible error. The court held that (1) it was clear the settlement agreement with one of the physicians was intended to be a covenant not to sue and did not release other tortfeasors, (2) the drug manufacturer was improperly denied cross-examination of the other physician whose testimony on proximate cause was essential to the case, and he may have been potentially biased by the terms of his settlement agreement, (3) the issue of proximate cause based on the drug manufacturer's failure to warn was properly submitted to the jury, and (4) the drug manufacturer's failure to comply with FDA regulations was improperly submitted and considered by the jury in reference to punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Chicago Bar Association (CBA), petitioned for a writ of mandamus regarding the election of respondent judicial candidates to five resident circuit court judge vacancies. The CBA sought to enjoin the primary election results with respect to the existing vacancies and to fill said vacancies for terms to expire concurrently with the upcoming general election, pursuant to Public Act of Sept. 6, 1989, 86--786, &sect;&sect; 1-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Public Act of Sept. 6, 1989 (Act), 86--786, &sect;&sect; 1-3, amended prior law by creating two appellate judgeships in the Third Judicial District, dividing the First Judicial District for the election of some appellate judges, and dividing the Cook County circuit for the election of resident circuit judges. The court held that the provisions of the Act that pertained to the First Judicial District of the appellate court were unconstitutional. Applicable legislative history indicated that Cook County was to remain a single, undivided district for the selection of both supreme and appellate judges so that inadequate representation of Republicans and minorities in the First Judicial District appellate and circuit courts could be rectified. The invalid First Judicial District provisions were therefore not severable from the provisions pertaining to the Cook County circuit court. The Act's provisions regarding the Third Judicial District were severable and therefore valid because they were enacted to alleviate heavy caseload problems and were entirely unrelated to the First Judicial District provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CBA's petition for a writ of mandamus was denied because the legislative provisions upon which the petition was based were declared unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Detective investigating an apparent murder and arson found victim's body in her garage and fire damage. Defendant was eventually interrogated, orally confessed, and signed a written statement. The trial court denied defense motions to suppress evidence and to declare the Illinois death penalty statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 (1985), unconstitutional. At sentencing, the jury determined that there were not sufficient mitigating circumstances to preclude imposition of the death sentence. On appeal, the court found that while defendant's interrogations were lengthy, no coercion or threats were involved. The court also rejected defendant's contention that he committed residential burglary rather than burglary because an attached garage was not necessarily a &quot;dwelling&quot; within the meaning of the residential burglary statute. The court held that prosecutor's statements during trial were neither flagrant nor inflammatory, and did not serve to deny defendant a fair trial. The court also found that defendant was eligible for the death penalty as he committed murder, arson, aggravated arson and burglary as part of the same criminal episode.</SPAN></P>

The city and trucking company sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the First District (Illinois) that affirmed the trial court's grant of the physician's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician argued that the contribution action was barred by the statute of repose in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13-212(a) because it was filed more than four years after the underlying negligent acts occurred. The city and trucking company argued that the statute of repose did not apply to contribution actions and that a contribution claim could be commenced any time during the pendency of the underlying case. The court held that the contribution action against the physician was time-barred by the medical malpractice statute of repose. An &quot;action for damages&quot; under the medical malpractice statute of repose was not limited to actions at law. The statute encompassed contribution actions against physicians for patient care because the basis for contribution rested on the contributor's liability in tort to the injured party, regardless of whether that theory of liability was asserted by the injured party. In addition, the insurer was exposed to the same liability in contribution as it had in a direct suit. The procedural requirement that contribution actions be brought within the pendency of an underlying suit did not mean that a suit brought within that period was timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ill. Rev.

The company was organized in New York, which imposed a premium tax on all insurers of one percent on gross premiums and a &quot;franchise&quot; tax. The department assessed a net retaliatory tax based on the total New York tax the company would have had to pay if it were a foreign insurer in New York.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. At the hearing on his motion to suppress, evidence was presented that defendant was slumped over the steering wheel of his parked car when police approached, believing him to be sleeping or in distress. After knocking on the window, the officers asked for his license. The officers testified that when defendant exited the vehicle, a gun could be seen in plain view through the open door. Defendant disputed this and testified that his door was closed and the gun found during a nonconsensual search. The motion was denied and he was convicted, but the appellate court reversed, ruling that defendant was unlawfully seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the gun should have been suppressed. On further appeal, the supreme court ruled that the trial court's findings that defendant had not been seized and the officers were performing a community caretaking function were not manifestly erroneous. The mere approaching and questioning of defendant did not constitute a seizure, but was a consensual encounter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murder of a three-month old infant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's statements were voluntary and that the trial court's finding thereon was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that the extent and nature of the infant's injuries, as well as defendant's own statement and testimony from the infant's mother, were sufficient to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court opined that defendant was not denied assistance of counsel by the trial court's refusal to allow a continuance once defendant's retained counsel entered his appearance. The trial court properly admitted the testimony of an examining psychiatrist at the sentencing hearing because defense counsel requested both psychiatric examinations and defense counsel's representations during opening statement warranted the admission of the testimony in rebuttal. The prosecutor's statement in closing argument that defendant had raped a girl for whose murder he had been previously convicted was not improper given the evidence of rape. Finally, the court concluded that the state's death penalty statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion for a supervisory order, but did enter a supervisory order directing that the &sect; 114--5(c) motions be transferred to another judge for a hearing. The court found that there was evidence in the record that suggested that the state filed the &sect; 114 -- 5(c) motions in the six criminal proceedings before the trial judge in an attempt to coerce the chief judge of the circuit court to reassign the trial judge from the felony division of the circuit court to the juvenile division. The court also found that the state's blanket use of substitution motions in all felony proceedings before the trial judge, when viewed in conjunction with its earlier attempts at having the trial judge reassigned, posed a substantial threat to the dignity and independence of the judiciary. The court determined that although trial judges could not assess the allegations of prejudice in &sect; 114--5(c), the trial judges could where there was prima facie evidence of unconstitutional conduct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the municipal corporation's motion to certify the question of whether the Tort Immunity Act was applicable to the municipal corporation, and the appellate court granted the municipal corporation's leave for appeal. Thereafter, the appellate court reversed the trial court's order and held that the Tort Immunity Act applied to the municipal corporation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the powers conferred on the municipal corporation were public objects and governmental functions essential to the public interests. Thus, there was no question that the providing of a playground was a governmental activity. In addition, the court did not find any injury or wrong to be redressed under Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this consolidated case, the state appealed judgments of the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois), which dismissed the indictments against defendants because of its ruling that the obscenity statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20 (1987), under which they were charged, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with the sale or delivery of materials in violation of the obscenity statute. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss because it held that the affirmative defense exempting dissemination to scientific institutions, established by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20(f)(2) (1987), was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court rejected defendants' argument that the indictments were duplicitous. The state appealed the dismissal of the indictments. The court reversed the judgments. Defendants lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the affirmative defense portion of the statute as there was no evidence that they intended to rely on that defense at trial. Because no justiciable controversy was raised, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court did address the issue of constitutionality and concluded that the statute was constitutional. It found that the scientific exemption was not overly vague. The court also considered the indictments void for duplicity because they charged sale or delivery, which were alternate and disparate acts, the performance of either of which constituted an offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Court for the Third District (Illinois) reversed a trial court ruling, which convicted defendant on three counts of criminal sexual abuse in violation of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with four counts of sexual misconduct, all of which stemmed from the same incident on the same date. The three charges at issue were not added to the indictment until after the expiration of the three-year limitation period. The court found, however, that an exception to the limitations period would have generally applied under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3 -- 7 (1987) because the timely count (the count not at issue here) was pending against defendant for the same conduct that gave rise to the remaining counts when the latter counts were filed. The court refused to allow this statutory exception to toll the limitations period. However, because the court found the state was required to not only set forth circumstances which, in and of themselves, provided a basis for tolling a limitation period, but the state was also required to make clear that those circumstances were in fact the basis upon which the state sought to toll the limitation period. The indictment at bar contained no language specifying that the limitation period should have been tolled because a prosecution was pending against defendant for the same conduct involved in the counts at issue.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-104(a)(3), which was a Class 2 felony. In affirming, the court concluded the circuit court was correct in holding unconstitutional the penalty of a Class 2 felony for the alteration by an owner of an automobile of the temporary registration permit for that automobile. A Class 2 penalty for a person who altered a temporary registration permit for a vehicle which he or she owned or to which he or she was legally entitled was not reasonably designed to protect automobile owners against theft, nor was it reasonably designed to protect the general public against the commission of crimes involving stolen motor vehicles. Such a penalty was violative of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, and could not stand. The court found that the penalty of a Class 2 felony for altering the temporary registration permit for a vehicle which one owned or to which one was legally entitled violated the guarantee of proportionate penalties in the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court vacated the trial court's orders. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, holding that defendant did not possess the right to petition the trial court to revoke her probation.

The board held that the Act preempted the village's zoning ordinance. The village appealed to the appellate court and the appellate court reversed. The court affirmed and held that the Act did not preempt local zoning ordinances. Section 39(c) of the Environmental Protection Act provided that an applicant had to meet and secure all necessary zoning approvals from the unit of government having zoning jurisdiction over the proposed facility. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, par. 1039(c) (1987).

The circuit court sentenced appellant to death and the circuit court entered judgment on the verdict and also directed that appellant serve an extended term of 60 years on the two rape convictions. Appellant argued that the state violated his U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV rights when it used coercive and improper tactics to procure his statements about the murders. Specifically, appellant argued that his statement was involuntary. The court concluded that the determination that appellant's confession was voluntary and not against the weight of the evidence. Appellant also argued that the circuit court erred in allowing the prior testimony of a witness before the grand jury to be admitted as substantive evidence. The court held that it was reversible error for the state to have been permitted to use prior statements of its witness as substantive evidence when the witness refused to testify at trial based on his U.S. Const. amend.

The court accepted jurisdiction under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 302(b), Ill. 2d R. 302(b), because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-1 (1987) was held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a denial of retrospective application of the finding of unconstitutionality ignored the ab initio rule of statutory invalidation, that the effect of enacting an unconstitutional amendment was to leave the law in force as it was before the adoption of the amendment, and that the proper remedy was a reversal of the conviction and a remand for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the vagueness of the law violated defendant's due process rights, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970). The law stated that a person committed child abduction when he intentionally lured or attempted to lure a child under 16 years of age into a vehicle without the parent's consent for other than a lawful purpose. Defendant on five consecutive days slowly drove his car past a 12-year old girl walking home from school, trying to converse with her and telling her &quot;come on.&quot; Defendant argued that the law impaired his free speech rights. The court held that due process required that a criminal statute be clearly defined and provide definite warning as to the proscribed conduct. The law's phrase &quot;for other than a lawful purpose&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. That phrase implied any action that violated the state's criminal code, not violations of administrative regulations of city ordinances. Attempts using speech to lure children into cars for a criminal purpose was not protected by the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments and held that the evidence, including three eyewitness accounts, was sufficient to prove defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not erred in accepting witness testimony and rejecting subsequent recantation. The court would not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact on questions involving the weight of the evidence or the credibility of witnesses. While discrepancies existed, the court could not say that the trial court's conclusion was so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory as to have raised a reasonable doubt as to defendants' guilt. The record did not support defendants' claim that a joint death penalty hearing made it impossible for the jury to render an individualized sentencing decision. The trial court instructed the jury to give separate consideration to each defendant; therefore, the jury was informed that each defendant was entitled to have his case decided only on the evidence and law applicable to him. The death penalty statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, there was no due process violation. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in limiting recross-examination to the scope of the redirect examination nor did it abuse its discretion in allowing a witness to testify about the results of the probable-cause hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employees sought review of a decision of the Appellate Court for the Second District of Illinois upholding a trial court's decision refusing to dismiss appellee victim's personal injury complaint under 107 Ill. 2d R. 315(a). Appellants asserted that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action and that only the Court of Claims (Illinois) had jurisdiction for an action against state employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee victim brought an action against appellants state employees based on alleged personal injuries. An appellate court refused to dismiss appellee's complaint under 107 Ill. 2d R. 315(a). The court remanded appellee's action for dismissal of her complaint, finding that the court in which appellee had brought her action lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. Under the Court of Claims Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 37, par. 439.1 - 439.24, the court noted, the Court of Claims (Illinois) had exclusive jurisdiction over matters brought against the State of Illinois in tort. Although appellee's action was technically filed against state employees, the court noted that there had been no allegations they acted beyond the scope of their authority, that the allegedly breached duty was not one owed to the public generally independent of their state employment, and that the alleged actions were within appellants' normal duties. The court, therefore, found the action had effectively been brought against Illinois. The court also found that it had jurisdiction to hear this matter and to grant required relief under 107 Ill. 2d R. 366(a)(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded appellee victim's action to the lower court for dismissal of her complaint, finding that her action was effectively one brought against a state because it involved activities of state employees acting within the ordinary course of employment. As such, the court found that only the Court of Claims could exercise jurisdiction over this matter. The court noted that it had jurisdiction over the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the convictions on the grounds that the trial court, under the rape shield statute, improperly excluded evidence of the victim's past sexual activities because the victim waived the statute's protection and that it was error not to allow defendant to impeach the victim's testimony that she had not dated since the incident in order to test her credibility. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the rape shield statute, Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 38/115-7, was clear and unambiguous and left no room for introduction of reputation or specific-act evidence from any party. The court held that defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by the exclusion of such testimony because testimony regarding the victim's prior sexual history was not relevant to the matter being tried, which was defendant's alleged sexual assault on victim. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defendant's impeachment of the victim's testimony because the testimony related to a collateral matter.</SPAN></P>

After his failure to make payment on the due date of the second installment, he received notice that he had to pay the taxes due, plus accrued interest and costs, in order to avoid legal action. Upon his failure to respond to the notice, the landowner's name was included among a list of landowners that had failed to remit their 1984 real estate taxes. A judgment and order of sale against those properties on the application list was entered. On January 31, 1986, pursuant to the judgment, the landowner's taxes were sold for a sum, which included an assessment of $ 10 for &quot;costs.&quot; The landowner redeemed the property from the tax sale for a price, which included the $ 10 charge, and filed a protest against the fee. He also filed this class action. The court held that the county officials had the discretion to determine the cost incurred when providing the landowner notice of delinquency by certified mail prior to the tax date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an appeal challenging an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), granting appellee's petition for &quot;writ&quot; of mandamus, seeking an award of meritorious good time credits by appellant sufficient to result in appellee's immediate release from prison, and denying appellant's motion to vacate the granting order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of unlawfully using weapons and sentenced to a State prison term. Unable to make bail, appellee served 217 days in county jail prior to sentencing. Upon transfer to the State penitentiary, appellee was required to serve a total of 276 days in jail, which exceeded his 270-day sentence. Appellee argued the State's policy of requiring each inmate to serve at least 61 days in the State penitentiary, regardless of the amount of jail time the inmate had spent in a county jail, violated an inmate's rights to equal protection and due process. The trial court agreed and ordered the State to release appellant immediately. On appeal, the court reversed, holding the trial court's judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the award of meritorious good time credit was not automatic but was given to eligible inmates, based upon appellant's discretion after considering numerous factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of mandamus was reversed; the lower court improperly usurped appellant's authority by exercising the discretion that the legislature had given solely to appellant to determine whether to award meritorious good time to inmates, reducing their prison sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, residents of a small residential real estate development and subdivision, sought to detach the development from one township and annex to another township pursuant to 105 Ill.

The Joint Board denied detachment, but the circuit court reversed. On appeal, plaintiffs argued defendants' petitions were invalid because certain signers failed to include a proper statement of their addresses. The court found that the identity of each and every individual could be readily determined by the name and street address when read in conjunction with the remaining contents of the petition and therefore it held the signatures to be valid. Further, the signatures were collected and timely filed in accordance with 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-1. The signatures were not stale and defendants' petition was sufficient as a matter of law. As to the constitutional claims, the court remanded for further hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a jury's finding of guilt, entered by the Circuit Court of Kankakee County (Illinois), in consolidated cases where he was charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and four counts of unlawful possession of a firearm, after he pled guilty in an earlier case to aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant pled guilty to aggravated battery and was sentenced to 24 months of probation. Separately, defendant was convicted of aggravated battery with a firearm and four counts of unlawful possession of a firearm pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12--4.2(a), 24--1.1(a) (West 1996) and 430 Ill. Comp. Stat. 65/2 (a) (1) (West 1996). In the separate case, defense counsel failed to inform defendant that he could receive a mandatory sentence of natural life imprisonment as a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The court reversed. The court held defense counsel was deficient in informing defendant on the range of sentences defendant could receive. The court also held on remand, if defendant was again convicted of possessing a firearm without a proper identification card, he was eligible for a misdemeanor sentence. Finally, the court reversed the probation revocation entered in the earlier case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed an order of the circuit court of Cook County (Illinois) affirming the decision that sales shipped from Illinois by a member of plaintiff's unitary business group to purchasers located outside Illinois should be &quot;thrown back&quot; to Illinois for inclusion in a combined Illinois sales factor, and assessed penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in Illinois was part of a nationwide unitary business group. Defendant ruled that the &quot;throwback rule&quot; applied to sales of goods by member of plaintiff's unitary business group that were shipped from Illinois to customers in other states where such members were not subject to taxation, but where other members of the group were subject to taxation. Defendant also assessed penalties for failure to include such sales in taxable income. The appellate court reversed as to assessed penalties for one tax year. The court otherwise affirmed the ruling, concluding that if the economic activity of plaintiff was not taxable in the destination states, it was taxable in the shipping State of Illinois using the throwback rule; 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 502(e) did not require a unitary business group to be treated as a single &quot;person&quot;; apportionment focused on &quot;business activity,&quot; and shipping was included in such activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to penalties imposed for one tax year. The judgment was otherwise affirmed. The &quot;throwback rule&quot; applied to plaintiff's economic activity, which included its shipping activity; if the activity was not taxable in the states to where its products were shipped, then the activity was taxable in the shipping state of Illinois.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant raised several issues, but the court affirmed the conviction, finding no reversible error. The trial court did not commit prejudicial error by allowing the appellee state to refer to him by his nickname, &quot;Psycho,&quot; because it was introduced only for the relevant purpose of establishing defendant's identity. The law enacting the residual hearsay statute,&nbsp;725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10.2, did not violate the single subject rule of Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, &sect; 8(d), and was not unconstitutional, so the statute itself was constitutional. The statement admitted into evidence under that statute contained sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to satisfy the statute and U.S. Const. amend. VI, considering the totality of circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued the owner of Wrigley Field, Chicago National League Ball Club (the Cubs), after he was struck by a foul ball during a baseball game. In a four-count complaint, plaintiff alleged that before 1992, a net hung between the upper deck and a backstop behind home plate at Wrigley Field. In 1992, the Cubs removed the net when it built skyboxes behind home plate. Plaintiff alleges the Cubs assumed a duty to protect patrons from foul balls by installing the original netting and that this duty was breached when the Cubs willfully and wantonly, or negligently, removed the netting, and failed to warn patrons of the increased risk. Plaintiff contended, on appeal, that the Baseball Facility Liability Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 38/1 et seq. (West 1996), was unconstitutional special legislation, denying plaintiff equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an amended complaint against defendant for property damage. Counts II and IV of plaintiff's amended complaint were supposedly based on an intentional misconduct theory rather than negligence.

The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 2-604.1 precluded plaintiff from requesting punitive damages on the face of any complaint based, even in part, on a negligence theory. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in dismissing counts II and IV, considering plaintiff's repeated disregard of &sect; 2-604.1 and his refusal of the trial court's offer to conduct a hearing to determine whether sufficient facts existed to support a punitive damages claim.</SPAN></P>

Prior to that, defendant merely had the burden of proving his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. The new legislation had the effect of increasing defendant's burden of proof to a clear and convincing evidence standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several counts of first-degree murder for a drowning death.

The court held that because defendant's right to a speedy trial was tolled, had his attorney moved to dismiss the charges on speedy trial grounds, the motion would have been denied. Therefore, defendant failed to establish the prejudice prong under Strickland and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing an instruction on second-degree murder, or on involuntary manslaughter, but that defendant was entitled to calculation of day-for-day credit, as it existed prior to any truth-in-sentencing amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with first-degree murder, three counts of attempted first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm. He was convicted on five of the counts. The trial court originally sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of 18, 17, 17, 10 and 10 years in prison. Defendant filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiff State filed a motion to reconsider. The trial court granted the plaintiff's motion, resentenced defendant to 35 years and concluded the sentences should run consecutively. Defendant appealed. The court vacated the trial court's resentencing order and ordered the original sentences reinstated. The court held once the notice of appeal was filed, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter its resentencing order. The court also held the original sentences were proper because the crimes were not committed as part of a single course of conduct, as required by the consecutive sentencing statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois), affirming the decision of defendant, Illinois Department of Professional Regulation, which rejected plaintiffs' applications for licensing as private detectives because plaintiffs failed to satisfy statutory qualifications required of private detectives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs applied to defendant, Illinois Department of Professional Regulation, for licensing as private detectives. Defendant rejected the applications because plaintiffs failed to satisfy statutory qualifications required of private detectives. The circuit court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the court cited a two-part test to determine whether the apprenticeship provision of the Private Detective, Private Alarm, Private Security, and Locksmith Act of 1993 (Act), 225 Ill Comp. Stat. 446/75 (a) (6), was constitutionally valid. The act conferred a monopolistic right to instruct, and the apprenticeship was not calculated to enhance the expertise of prospective licensees. Thus, in applying the test, the court found the Act, as interpreted by defendant, to violate both prongs of the test, and was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reversed and remanded with directions. The court held that the statute, as interpreted by defendant, was invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a social worker since 1959, was classified as a certified social worker in 1969.

Upon recommendation by the administrative law judge, defendant cancelled plaintiff's license and ordered a lower tier one. The lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed; pursuit of a profession was not a fundamental right so, under the rational basis test, the legislation's educational mandates bore a rational relationship to the legitimate purpose of protecting the public and were neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. The defendant had the authority to rescind or cancel plaintiff's license; given its wide latitude, defendant's decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence; neither equitable estoppel or laches barred the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was originally indicted for three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault.

Later, he plead guilty to one count of predatory criminal sexual assault. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The trial court denied his motion to reduce sentence. Defendant appealed. He argued his conviction had to be vacated because the offense of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child was unconstitutional. The court held the statute as applied was invalid. The court held the last act leading to defendant's conviction occurred in January of 1996, but the predatory criminal sexual assault statute did not go in effect until May of 1996.

The statute must have a secular legislative purpose; its main effect must be one that does not advance or inhibit religion; and it must not foster excessive entanglement with religion. It need contain only one of these defects to be unconstitutional. The appellate court held the statute was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pharmacy appealed a judgment in plaintiff survivors' claims of wrongful death, contending that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial due to prejudice from a television news story about pharmacy misfills which aired during the week of trial, refusing a special interrogatory regarding contributory negligence, admitting evidence without a chain of custody, and in allowing testimony from two expert witnesses. The court found that the television program was palpably prejudicial, particularly its timing, and was of such character and magnitude as to deprive defendant of a fair trial. The court also found that although the special interrogatory did not test the general verdict, it provided means by which the jury's award could be distributed consistent with its finding of contributory negligence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was sued civilly and prosecuted criminally, and was convicted of various criminal charges.

The alleged breach occurred during plaintiff's criminal trial, after opening statements. One defendant attorney drafted a highly detailed list of proposed cross-examination questions that contained detailed, specific information about the behavior of plaintiff. The questions were provided to the prosecutors. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that, based on the record, it could not say that no attorney-client relationship was formed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant yelled, pounded his fists on the counter, and called victim epithets at a restaurant where victim worked. Defendant was arrested for disorderly conduct and charged with a hate crime, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12--7.1 (West 1994). The court held that defendant remained free to believe what he wanted, but he could not force his opinions on others by shouting, pounding on a counter, and disrupting a lawful business. The court held that the hate crime statute required conduct beyond mere expression and that the statute constitutionally regulated conduct without infringing upon free speech. The court held that the hate crime statute was not facially unconstitutional when the predicate offense was disorderly conduct because the statute reached only conduct and did not punish speech itself; the statute did not impermissibly discriminate based on content; and the statute did not chill the exercise of U.S. Const. amend. I rights.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the court vacated defendant's conviction for armed violence based on residential burglary. The sentencing court was not given the option of considering an extended-term sentence on defendant's residential burglary conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two charges of criminal sexual assault. In exchange for defendant's guilty plea, the state dismissed other charges which could have imposed mandatory consecutive sentences.

Because defendant did not file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the trial court denied defendant's motion to reconsider. Defendant appealed. The appellate court held that claims of an unconstitutional sentence were not waived, modified defendant's sentence in light of the invalidated statute and remanded the cause for the trial court to admonish defendant of his right to move to withdraw his guilty plea and vacate his sentence.</SPAN></P>

(West 1996) and Child Sex Offender and Murderer Community Notification Law, 730 ILCS 152/101 et seq. (West 1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted in 1986 of criminal sexual assault. In 1997, he was indicted for failing to register as a sex offender. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment alleging the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 ILCS 150/1 et seq. (West 1996) and the Child Sex Offender and Murderer Community Notification Law, 730 ILCS 152/101 et seq. (West 1996) were unconstitutional. The trial court denied defendant's motion and found him guilty. Defendant appealed. The court considered sex offender statutes effective in both 1996 and 1997. The court held it appropriate to consider the constitutionality of the statutes as they existed when defendant allegedly failed to register as a sex offender. Consequently, the court applied the 1996 sex offender statutes. The court also held all of defendant's challenges to the laws had been previously been considered and rejected, and upheld the constitutionality of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of the trial court upholding the constitutionality Sex Offender Registration Act and Child Sex Offender and Murderer Community Notification Law affirmed because unconstitutionality of statutes in existence when defendant failed to register as a sex offender was rejected in other cases and defendant raised no new arguments concerning them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that defendant solicited two children under age 13 to have sexual intercourse, an act which if completed would be predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. The trial court found defendant &quot;not not guilty&quot; and ordered that defendant be remanded to the department of mental health for treatment. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute was void and unconstitutional as it failed to include a sentence for the offense. On appeal, the court construed the indecent solicitation of a child statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-6 (West 1996), and concluded that the only logical reading of the statute was to classify the predicate act of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child as a class 4 felony. The legislative intent was clear from the statute and the penalty section of the statute should be read to include &quot;predatory criminal sexual assault of a child.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested and charged in separate criminal cases with various weapons-related violations. The plaintiff city seized and impounded the vehicles defendants were driving. At the probable cause hearings the judges ordered the city to release the impounded vehicles. Plaintiff moved to vacate the release orders. The trial court denied or struck each motion to vacate and subsequently held the City's Law Department and the city's then Corporation Counsel individually in contempt for refusing to return one defendant's vehicle. On appeal, the court determined the home-rule municipal ordinance was constitutional; the trial court lacked authority to order release of the vehicles seized pursuant to that municipal ordinance; the trial courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order release of the vehicles because there was no exhaustion of the city's administrative adjudication process; and the civil contempt judgment was void. The court vacated the lower court's orders and reversed the judgment of contempt.</SPAN></P>

The trial court gave petitioner time to amend his petition, which he did. After a hearing to recount the votes, the parties stipulated that many votes were uninitialed, and petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that those votes were not to be counted, which the court granted. On respondent's request for a recount, the trial court ordered that petitioner had won. On respondent's appeal, the court affirmed; it held that the amended petition related back to the original, so it was timely filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was executor for the estate of an Illinois resident who sued appellant attorney in Illinois under a contract which provided that any legal action would be brought in Illinois.

Appellant attorney and law firm moved to dismiss the Illinois complaint on the basis of res judicata, and petitioned for registration of the Mississippi judgment pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-650 et seq. (West 1996). The trial court found that the Mississippi judgment had been procured by fraud, in part because the Mississippi court was informed neither of the contract's venue provision nor of the Illinois suit. The court reversed because the trial court's findings involved intrinsic rather than extrinsic fraud, and were not a proper basis for denying full faith and credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendants husband and wife guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) of intimidation, 720 Ill. Comp.

The defendants were sentenced to concurrent five-year terms of imprisonment for intimidation, but the convictions for threatening a public official were vacated. The appellate court affirmed the convictions, holding that the letters which the defendants wrote provided sufficient evidence to support the conviction of intimidation beyond a reasonable doubt; that the application of the GBMI statute was constitutional; that the letters were threats designed to coerce the victims to comply with defendants' wishes and thus, not constitutionally protected speech or free exercise of religion under U.S. Const. amend.

The appellate court further rejected the arguments that defense counsel was ineffective and victim testimony was improperly admitted, its relevance going directly to the letters' tendency to create apprehension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions of threats and intimidation affirmed, because the letters that defendants themselves wrote provided sufficient evidence to support the judgment of guilty but mentally ill and threatening letters not constitutionally protected speech or protected as the free exercise of religion under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee subcontractor brought suit against appellants, a corporation and a construction company, alleging that appellants breached a subcontract by failing to pay appellee for its subcontracting work.
