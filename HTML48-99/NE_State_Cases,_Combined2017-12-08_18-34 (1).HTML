</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle operator challenged the constitutionality of a statute requiring motorcyclists to wear a helmet, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 39-6210 - 39, 6214 (Reissue, 1988). The court affirmed and modified a district court decision finding that this statute was constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, noting that the law impinged on no fundamental constitutional rights and created no suspect constitutional classifications and therefore was presumptively lawful because it bore a rational relationship to legitimate government interests, Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18. The court also found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, noting that for the most part it was in accord with federal regulations, 49 C.F.R. &sect; 571.218, S3 (1991). As against that, the court found that one portion of the challenged statute had no federal counterpart and therefore violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, but declared that portion of the statute severable. Finally, the court found that the statute properly delegated rulemaking authority to a state agency, noting that a legislature may so delegate rulemaking authority to implement a statute's policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed from the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which found that his action was barred by the 10-year statute of repose, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-224(2) (1989). The employee was injured in an accident on May 16, 1983, while employed by defendant employer. An &quot;RH5 degree&quot; multi-piece wheel mounted on a truck exploded when the employee attempted to inflate the tire mounted on the wheel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The RH5 degree multi-piece wheel consisted of a disk/rim and a side ring. The disk had been manufactured by defendant manufacturer and the rim and side ring had been manufactured by defendant rubber company in March 1965. The disk had been attached to the rim by the manufacturer on April 11, 1955. The employee commenced his cause of action on May 11, 1987. The court held that the only issue before the district court was whether the 1955 disk/rim assembly and the 1965 side ring had been first sold for use more than 10 years before the employee filed his petition on May 11, 1987. The court found that all of the witnesses with personal knowledge of the use of the truck testified that the wheel assemblies on it were not changed during their period of ownership, establishing that the wheel assembly which was involved in the accident had been first sold for use more than 10 years before the employee brought the action. The employee was not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of the statute of repose. The court found that the evidence on the issue of the statute of repose was uncontroverted that the products had been in use for more than the statutory period. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court and held that the employee's claim was barred by the statute of repose because the disk/rim assembly and the side ring had been first sold for use more than 10 years before the employee brought his cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nurse held a registered-nursing license from New York. She applied for a Nebraska registered-nursing license by reciprocity in 1974. The board denied the nurse's application and found that there was sufficient evidence of the nurse's unprofessional conduct to justify denial of the license. The nurse again applied for a license in 1978, and her application was denied. In 1980, the nurse once again applied for a license. The board denied her license, but offered her a temporary permit that could become permanent if she completed a refresher nursing course. The nurse did not complete the course. In 1983, the nurse applied for a license, but the board denied her application because she did not complete the refresher course and offered her another conditional license. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting judgment for the board. The board's decision had a preclusive effect on later adjudication. When a state agency acting in a judicial capacity resolved disputed issues of fact properly before it and the parties were given an adequate opportunity to litigate those issues, the courts were to give the agency's factfinding a preclusive effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer commenced an action against defendants, state, governor, treasurer, tax commissioner, and attorney general (state), seeking a declaration that 1991 Neb. Laws 829 was an unconstitutional violation of the uniformity clause of Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, the commutation of taxes under Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, and the multiple subject provision of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1991 Neb. Laws 829, &sect; 7, exempted from the property tax rolls all personal property except motor vehicles. The taxpayer contended that &sect; 7 violated the uniformity clause of Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The state contended that 1991 Neb. Laws 829, &sect; 7 was expressly permitted under Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, which authorized the legislature to classify and exempt any or all personal property from taxation. The court held that in exercising its power to exempt certain property from taxation, the legislature had to adhere to the dictates of both &sect; 2 and Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court further held that in determining whether an exemption was valid under Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, the court had to first consider whether the exemption improperly shifted the property tax burden to the remaining tax base and if not, the court then had to consider whether there was a substantial difference of circumstances justifying differing legislation. The court found that 1991 Neb. Laws 829, &sect; 7 improperly shifted the property tax burden to the remaining taxpayers because there was no reimbursement system in place that would be used to replace those exempted from the tax base.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted judgment for the taxpayer, finding that the personal property tax exemption was an unconstitutional violation of the state constitution's uniformity clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought an action against defendants, the State of Nebraska and several of its officials, seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of 1991 Neb. Laws, L.B. 829, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned a farm rental business, in connection with which he purchased an irrigation pipe and a copying machine. In computing his federal income taxes, he had previously taken deductions for cost recovery regarding the irrigation pipe and copying machine. However, for tax year 1991 only, L.B. 829, &sect; 20, imposed a surcharge of two percent of all depreciation, which included any deduction for cost recovery on tangible property used in a trade or business. The court had previously held that L.B. 829, &sect; 7, as it related to the 1991 tax year, violated the uniformity clause of the Nebraska Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1. The court found that &sect;&sect; 20 through 25 of L.B. 829 were clearly part of a package designed to raise the revenues needed to reimburse the State's political subdivisions for moneys lost due to the effect of &sect; 7 in the 1991 tax year. Thus, &sect; 7 was a specific inducement to passage of &sect;&sect; 20 through 25, and enforcement of the latter in the absence of the exemptions contained in the former would do violence to the intent of the Legislature. Therefore, the court declared &sect;&sect; 20 through 25 of L.B. 829 unconstitutional by virtue of its prior decision as to &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

The citizens sought an order enjoining defendants, state officials and the State, from abolishing one county as a unitary district and dividing the county between two preexisting districts. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court reversed the judgment and held that Neb. Const. art.

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder count, 15 to 30 years' imprisonment on the attempt count, and 6 to 15 years' imprisonment on each of the firearm counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged with first degree murder and attempted first degree murder, but he was convicted of second degree murder and attempted second degree murder for the shootings of a decedent and her friend. On appeal, defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the convictions and that the trial court erred in admitting testimony as to defendant's discharge of a handgun during the days and weeks prior to the shootings. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions because, although defendant argued with the decedent prior to the shootings, the decedent's behavior was not the sort of &quot;severe&quot; provocation that would have excited the passion of a reasonable person, causing the person to lose normal self-control, and it was not seriously disputed that defendant caused the decedent's death and intended to do so. The court found that the claimed provocation was also inadequate to support a manslaughter conviction for the second shooting. The court concluded that the complained of evidence was relevant to the case, and defendant failed to object to it at the time of trial, thus waiving any error therein.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court erred in enjoining the execution because the commutation proceedings were not unconstitutional and: (1) the trial court had no authority to enjoin the execution, (2) the board had unfettered discretion to grant or deny clemency, (3) defendant, as an applicant for commutation, had no due process rights because the board's commutation decision was a discretionary act of grace from the executive branch, and (4) the offender's life already had been taken away by due process in the State's post-conviction judicial sentencing process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the State of Nebraska on the relation of its Attorney General, requested the court to declare certain sections of 1992 Neb. Laws, L.B. 424, to be unconstitutional as violative of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 2 to 4, as well as of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Respondents, the Secretary of State and the Lancaster County Attorney, were temporarily enjoined from enforcing the challenged provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General challenged &sect; 14(4) and 14(5) of L.B. 424, which required every circulator of a petition to be a resident and registered voter in the county in which the petition was being circulated. The court held that Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 4, authorizing the legislature to enact laws to facilitate the operation of the initiative power, meant that it could enact reasonable legislation to prevent fraud or to render intelligible the purpose of the proposed law or constitutional amendment. Laws to facilitate the operation of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 had to be reasonable, so as not to unnecessarily obstruct or impede the operation of the law. The court found that the effect of the challenged provisions of L.B. 424 was to place impossible barriers to the economically less fortunate to successfully initiate legislation if they could not afford to pay local circulators and were forbidden to solicit outside their own counties. Thus, &sect; 14(4) and &sect; 14(5), to the extent it was referable to violations of &sect; 14(4), violated Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 4, by impeding the initiative and referendum process instead of facilitating the process as the Constitution required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the challenged legislation was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The county intervened, concurring with the department's claims that the property was being used as a junkyard, contending that the property was in violation of certain zoning ordinances. The trial court granted the requested injunction, and the owner appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the owner's use of the property did constitute a junkyard but that the property was exempt from &sect; 39-2601 and the zoning ordinances because it had been operated in the same capacity since before the statute and ordinances had been enacted.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the issues included whether Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based, inter alia, on the testimony of a police officer who was a part time security officer in the store where the incident occurred, the evidence and the inferences that could be drawn therefrom showed, inter alia, that defendant furtively moved about a department store, took women's clothing and placed them in a sack from another department store, filled or assisted another person in filling the sack to such a capacity that it could only be dragged across the floor, and took the sack to another floor and concealed it. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 28-511.01 was not unconstitutionally overbroad nor did it violate due process. Further, &sect; 28-511.01 set forth the requisite criminal intent. The court held that the State did not have to show a complete chain of custody tracing the possession of the items to the final custodian. The prosecution laid sufficient foundation for the clothing to be introduced into evidence. The court held that there was sufficient evidence regarding the value of the items the State charged her with shoplifting.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abutting landowners purchased land abutting the landowner's property. At the time of such purchase, both pieces of land were zoned residential. Following a public hearing, the city amended its zoning ordinance to allow heavy industrial use on the landowner's property. The landowner then applied for a permit authorizing it to build a warehouse on its property such that its 30-foot high rear wall was within 1 foot of the division line of the abutting landowners' property. However, the heavy-industrial-use zoning designation required a 15-foot rear yard building setback when the property abutted a residential zone. As such, the board granted the landowner a variance. The court affirmed the reversal of the variance grant and held that the landowner's reason for the variance, which was to maximize its profits and to expand its operations, was not a proper basis for the variance. The court further held that the landowner took the risk that there was a possibility that the trial court was to order the landowner to tear down the portion of the building that was built in accordance with the variance if the abutting landowners' appeal was successful.</SPAN></P>

Both unions proposed that the contracts contain provisions for binding arbitration. The state refused to submit to the arbitration agreement and filed a declaratory judgment action. The state requested the trial court to invalidate the final and binding arbitration clauses of the labor contracts and to declare the Nebraska Uniform Arbitration Act (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-2601 et seq., unconstitutional. The trial court granted the judgment, holding that certain provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that as to arbitration of future disputes, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-2602 violated Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, as well as the binding arbitration clauses in the labor contracts. The court ruled that there were no false representations or concealment of material facts on the part of the state. Both unions knew that the state had reservations about the arbitration clauses.

Specifically, defendant argued that the affidavit requesting a search warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause for issuing the warrant because the reliability of an informant was not established by the affidavit and that the search warrant contained an inaccurate description of the premises to be searched in violation of the particularity clause of U.S. Const. amend. IV. It was undisputed that the street address contained in the search warrant was not the correct street address of the house that was searched. The court affirmed, holding that the affidavit, under the totality of the circumstances, was sufficient to establish that the magistrate had probable cause for issuance of the search warrant. Also, the description in the search warrant was reasonable for the location intended. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting all of the firearms found in the immediate vicinity of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An anonymous tip resulted in defendant's arrest for a series of retail store robberies. The tip described defendant's distinct physical characteristics, unemployment, and use of the stolen money to buy drugs.

After the trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, defendant was convicted on charges of robbery and attempted robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and modified defendant's sentence. The court held that: (1) defendant's warrantless arrest on the basis of a reliable anonymous tip was supported by reasonable cause under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-404.03 (Reissue 1989); (2) under the totality of facts and circumstances involved, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendant's statements were given freely and voluntarily, and were not the product of any promise or inducement, direct or implied, no matter how slight; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion by imposing an excessive sentence on defendant, which was greater than the minimum period necessary to protect the public and rehabilitate defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant plead no contest to the practicing psychology without a license charge and the jury found defendant guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a child. A lower appellate court affirmed. Upon review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to sustain a jury finding that defendant contributed to the delinquency of a child where there was no evidence defendant did anything which caused or tended to cause the delinquent to behave in a manner injurious to the morals of herself or others. The court found Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-709(2)(b) did not create a duty on the part of persons coming into contact with runaways to immediately notify either the parents or authorities. The court concluded the trial court did not error by imposing a sentence of incarceration for the practicing psychology without a license offense where defendant had indicated to the trial judge that he would not comply with the terms of probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which affirmed his county court conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Omaha, Nebraska, Mun. Code, ch. 20, art. VII, &sect; 20-192 (1990). Defendant contended that the district court erred in holding that &sect; 20-192 was not unconstitutionally vague and, in the alternative, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon seeing defendant drive over a curb and into a pole, officers approached his car to investigate. During a pat-down search, the officers found two knives on his person, one a folding knife, and one with a fixed three and a half inch blade. He explained that a third knife found was a leatherworking tool. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 20-192, which prohibited the carrying of a concealed weapon. The district court affirmed, and he appealed, contending that the code section was unconstitutionally vague in that it prohibited the carrying of any instrument likely to cause death or bodily injury, and ,the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court affirmed, finding that an ordinary person could determine whether the use of a particular instrument as a weapon was likely to cause death or injury, and how the person intended to use it was a question for the trier of fact. Moreover, the appearance and character of defendant's knives and the circumstance under which they were discovered tended to establish that he knew that the knives, if used as weapons, were likely to cause death or bodily injury. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff searched the car and seized several items, including a sawed-off shotgun. Defendant was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and with being a habitual criminal.

The trial court overruled his motion to withdraw his plea and convicted him of the charge. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that he was not prejudiced by virtue of the fact that he did not know of the adoption of Initiative 403 before he entered his plea because Neb. Rev.

The trial court permanently enjoined the taverns from possessing or allowing the playing of video gambling devices on their premises and found &sect; 28-1107(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The legislature's power could not be used to nullify or circumvent the state constitution. To redefine the activity that the legislature sought to permit required an amendment to the state constitution. Absent such amendment, &sect; 28-1107(2) was unconstitutional as contravention of the express provision of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 24. An injunction was proper because a court of equity had jurisdiction to enjoin a threatened injury whenever its nature was such that it could not be adequately compensated in damages and its continuance led to a constantly recurring grievance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public service companies were public service entities within the meaning of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-801.01 (Reissue 1990) and were centrally assessed for purposes of personal property taxation.The board met to determine the value of companies' property for 1990 and to equalize such valuations for tax purposes. The companies appealed from the findings and order of the board, denying claims for property tax relief.The court reversed and remanded and held, inter alia, that: (1) the portion of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-202(11) (Reissue 1990) exempting railroad rolling stock from taxation was unconstitutional; (2) Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-103 (Reissue 1990) was unconstitutional; (3) even if Nebraska's classification of property as exempt and not exempt was valid under the Nebraska Constitution, the system could not withstand muster under federal law; (6) federal law had eviscerated the portion of Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, that was at issue in Stahmer v. State, 192 Neb. 63, 218 N.W.2d 893 (1974), and, accordingly, Stahmer v.

The record revealed that the book store was convicted on three separate occasions for violating the ordinance and continued to operate with enclosed booths. The book store challenged Lincoln Municipal Code &sect; 5.12.175 and alleged that it was unconstitutional because it is vague, overbroad, or a prior restraint upon freedom of expression. The court disagreed and held that there was nothing vague about the prohibition against fully enclosed booths. The court also held that the ordinance provided adequate notice to persons of ordinary intelligence regarding the conduct prohibited and provided adequate standards to law enforcement officials. Finally, the court held that the ordinance was an impermissible prior restraint on free speech because it did not restrain the book store from selling to its patrons whatever books, films, videotapes, or other forms of entertainment provided that it complied with the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DCS director had approved termination of the employee because he was found asleep on the job. The board found that the employee was asleep at his post as alleged, a serious violation of agency policy, but it found that the offense was not commensurate with the discipline imposed, when the mitigating factors were considered. The DCS appealed to the district court, which reviewed the board's decision on the record of the agency. It reinstated the termination. On appeal, the court was required to consider the matter de novo on the record, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84-918, as it was in effect at the time of the offense. The court found that it was not unreasonable to expect that security guards at a maximum security prison would remain awake and alert during their tour of duty. The employee asserted that he missed none of his required fire checks, and he complained that DCS's concern about a fire or suicide was based solely on speculation and conjecture. However, actual harm was not required to impose discipline; an employee's violation of a departmental rule, thereby compromising the security of the facility, was sufficient for disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no reasonable and substantial relationship between the classification and the object sought to be accomplished by bill, which was alleged to instill confidence in the legislature, because the legislation would have had the opposite effect of instilling fear that every time someone was injured, the state would rescue him. The court rejected the state officials argument that legislative classifications would be upheld as long as there was some rational basis for establishing the classification or there was a valid public policy reason for establishing the legislative classification, because the bill was clearly contrary to the constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the issue was whether a 1981 amendment to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-224(2) and (5) could have been retroactively applied to causes of action based upon injury resulting from exposure to asbestos products which were first sold more than 10 years prior to 1981, which causes had earlier been extinguished by the provisions of an earlier enactment of the statute. The individual contended that the post-amendment text of the statute was the version which was applicable to the suit. The court concluded that the legislature could change statutes prescribing limitations to actions and that the one in force at the time suit was brought was applicable to the cause of action. However, the court held that this power was restricted because the legislature could not remove a bar or limitation which had already become complete. The court entered judgment in favor of the manufacturers, answering the question certified in the negative. The court held that &sect; 25-224(2) was a statute prescribing limitations on actions. As such, the court concluded that its amendment could not have resurrected the individual's action which the prior version of the statute had already extinguished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies owned centrally assessed property. They sought equalization by the board, but the board ruled that it had no authority to rule upon their requests. The state argued that legislative bills L.B. 1 and L.B. 7 rendered the companies' appeals moot. The court reversed the board's order and remanded the matter. It held that the companies' request had to be considered in the light of applicable law. The subject matter of L.B. 1 was irrelevant to the matter of equalization. The legislature's effort to exempt railroads in L.B. 7 was not based on a reasonable classification and violated proportionality and special legislation requirements. Section 306(1)(d) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, 49 U.S.C.S. 11503(b)(4), prohibited a discriminatory tax against a railroad, but did not prevent a state's nondiscriminatory taxation of a railroad.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that a search of his person was illegal under U.S. Const. amend. IV. On appeal, the court first noted that despite the fact that defendant had served his sentence, his appeal was not moot because, as a result of his conviction, defendant may suffer future penalties or disabilities, and therefore his case fell within an exception to the mootness doctrine established by caselaw. As for the issue of the constitutionality of the search, the court found that when looking at the totality of the information provided by the informant, together with corroboration of this information by police, the officers had sufficient reasonable suspicion to stop defendant after he left his home that evening, in order to investigate possible drug activity. The court held that the fact that the informant was paid for his information was inconsequential given that all his information was later determined to be accurate. Accordingly, the court determined that the search of defendant's person, whereby the cocaine was discovered in his underwear, was reasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV as a search incident to arrest.</SPAN></P>

The district court dismissed the petition. The court affirmed, holding that the acquitted persons statutes did not violate equal protection. Both the acquitted persons statues and the Nebraska Mental Health Commitment Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 83-1001 et seq. (Reissue 1987), required the district court or mental health board to find that the individual was dangerous to himself or herself or to others or that the individual would be dangerous in the foreseeable or near future. There was no constitutional violation in the wording of the acquitted persons statutes and no constitutional violation in the procedures for evaluation. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-3702 (Reissue 1989), which defined the requirements for an evidentiary hearing prior to the expiration of the evaluation period, was not vague.

The statutes were rationally related to the state's police power. The machines were gambling devices within the meaning of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1101. The machines were possessed in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1107 because it kept a permanent record of the replays awarded and thus did not fit into any exceptions found in &sect; 1107.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect;&sect; 79-1302 and 79-1303, the Commissioner annually apportioned and distributed the annual income from a school trust. Plaintiffs filed a petition against the Commissioner to have &sect;&sect; 79-1302 and 79-1303 declared unconstitutional. The petition also sought to enjoin the Commissioner from making in-lieu-of-tax distributions from the school trust to school districts in which unsold school land was contained. The school district contained no unsold school lands and did not receive an in-lieu-of-tax distribution. The trial court dismissed the petition, and plaintiffs appealed. The court determined that, pursuant to Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9, it was within the power of the legislature to establish in-lieu-of-tax payments to fulfill the state's duty as trustee to deal with the beneficiaries of the trust impartially and prevent any detriment to school districts in which untaxable school lands were contained. The court concluded, however, that the use of 143 percent of the valuation factor violated the duty of the state as trustee because it conferred a benefit or bonus upon school districts with school lands to the detriment of school districts without any.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he urges that: (1) Neb. Rev.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that: (1) the 1977 revision of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-713 repealed by implication the penalty provision then contained in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-705, and the legislature's 1988 removal of any reference to punishment from the warning provision of &sect; 32-705 merely confirmed what it had done by implication in its 1977 change to the penalty provision in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-713; thus, the statutes at issue were constitutional; (2) defendant waived his challenges to the trial court's evidentiary rulings; (3) the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction; and (4) it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny defendant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

They argued that a physical diversion was an essential element of any appropriation, and then reached the further conclusion that because of this, Neb. Const. art. XV, &sect; 6 must be read as prohibiting instream appropriations. The court disagreed. It found that diversions were not constitutionally required for all appropriations. It further stated that even if it were to conclude that the framers of Neb. Const. art. XV, &sect; 6 intended to give constitutional protection only to appropriations made by means of a physical diversion, it would not be forced to conclude that such protection prohibited the legislature from creating other means of acquiring rights to water.

The court did not allow one expert to challenge another, however, and it adopted the position taken by the first two experts. The court affirmed the sentence, finding that as it was supported by two expert opinions, it could not be considered to be an abuse of discretion. The court noted that defendant did have a liberty interest at stake, but he did not have a Sixth Amendment right to confront the experts. He did have a due process right, but it was adequately protected by the procedure that included provisions for: (1) multiple expert reports; (2) notice to defendant of the results; (3) an opportunity for defendant to obtain additional expert reports; (4) an independent judicial decision maker.

Defendant was convicted by a jury of being a felon in possession of a firearm with a barrel of less than 18 inches in length and of being a habitual criminal. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that defendant was carrying the firearm in self-defense because &sect; 28-1206(1) did not provide an exception for felons to carry firearms for self-defense; thus, defendant's alleged use of the firearm for such purpose did not excuse his violation of &sect; 28-1206(1).

The court held that a driver's license suspension of one year under &sect; 60-430.01 did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because he could pursue other modes of transportation. Furthermore, the suspension did not deprive defendant employment, as he could pursue other modes of transportation to reach his job. The court also found that defendant's waiver of his right to counsel was made voluntarily, understandingly, and intelligently and that the county court was neither asked nor required to appoint standby counsel. The court determined that defendant declined to exercise any of his peremptory challenges and that there was no error in the selection of the jury.

Before defendant was advised of his Miranda rights, he was not in custody or deprived of his freedom. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2523(1)(d) was not unconstitutionally vague.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 68-718 (Reissue 1986), which required the county to transfer the furniture and equipment of its public welfare program to the Nebraska Department of Social Services, was valid and granted summary judgment to appellees, State of Nebraska and its officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Legislation was passed that put administration of the State's social services program under the supervision of Department. Social services had previously been administered by the counties under the State's supervision. The Department notified the county that the office in that county was being relocated to another county and that the furniture in that office would be transferred to the new office. The county sought to have &sect; 68-718, which authorized the transfer, declared invalid and claimed it impermissibly authorized the transfer of property purchased solely with county funds out of the county. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees and the court affirmed. It found that the State had the authority to transfer the county's property, as the county acted only as an agent of the State. Further, regardless of where the property was used, the county received the benefit of the property as it was used in meeting the social services needs of those who resided in the county. The court also found that the transfer of the equipment was not an uncompensated taking, as the State was not taking private property when it took property from the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which granted summary judgment to appellees in the county's suit to obtain a judgment declaring invalid the statute which authorized the transfer of equipment used in the county's welfare programs to the Nebraska Department of Social Services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, state Attorney General (AG) brought an action pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84-215 (Reissue 1987), seeking the court's judicial determination that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 85-1, 118 to 85-1, 123 (Supp. 1989) were unconstitutional. Respondent Secretary of State defended the constitutionality of the statutes. The challenged legislation terminated the existence of a state college and incorporated it into the system of the University of Nebraska.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary argued that the legislation did not divest the state college Board of Trustees of the general government of state colleges and, therefore, was constitutional. The Secretary also argued that the state constitution did not mandate existence of state colleges, such as the one addressed by the legislation. In opposition, the AG argued that the state colleges was one of the &quot;existing&quot; educational institutions specifically identified in Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13. Because its government was thereby allegedly constitutionally vested in the Board, the AG argued that the legislature could not constitutionally delegate power to govern the state college to another state agency or officer. Although four of the court's justices agreed with the AG's argument, the three remaining justices concluded that the legislation was constitutional. Because Neb. Const. art. V, &sect; 2, mandated that a piece of legislation could not be held unconstitutional without the concurrence of five judges, the court held that the challenged legislation was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the challenged statutes were constitutional. Although a four-justice majority of the court concluded that the statutes were unconstitutional, the court was constrained by the state constitution's rule that a piece of legislation could not be declared unconstitutional by a majority of less than five judges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association sought review of a decision by the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which entered judgment in favor of appellees, former bank officers and others, in its action against the officers and the others on behalf of various depositors. The suit had alleged numerous improprieties in the management and supervision of the bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the suit was brought by the association, the bank subsequently was declared insolvent, collapsed, and was liquidated. The officers filed a motion for summary judgment in the association's case, alleging that the causes of action against them were released by the settlement of a tort claim by the receiver of the bank. The district court sustained the motion and dismissed the petition as to the officers. The remaining defendants, various financial institutions and individuals, filed demurrers to the amended petition, claiming, among other things, that the association was not the real party in interest and therefore lacked standing to bring suit. The district court sustained the demurrers on that basis and dismissed the petition, as it contained an incurable defect. The association assigned error to the district court in its interpretation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-199 (Reissue 1983). The court found that the association had not alleged an individual harm, but that its claims were derivative and clearly were properly pursued by the receiver under &sect; 8-199. But the court found that the association had stated a claim for relief against one of the other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting summary judgment to bank officers was affirmed. The court also affirmed the order of the trial court in sustaining the demurrers but reverse that part of the trial court's order dismissing the petition and remanded the cause with directions to allow the association to amend its petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant suffered a compensable injury to his shoulder. Three years later, he petitioned for a modification of benefits, alleging that he sustained an increase in incapacity. After his petition was dismissed, he sought a rehearing. On rehearing, the compensation court found that the claimant suffered an increase in incapacity and found that he was entitled to additional benefits. The claimant appealed, arguing that the modification of the original award was inadequate and that the compensation court erred in failing to award an attorney fee. In affirming in part, the court concluded that, where the evidence was in conflict but there was evidence to support that the compensation court's determination that the claimant suffered a permanent disability of the right upper extremity and not an injury to the body as a whole, the compensation court's findings of fact would not be reversed on appeal. In reversing in part, however, the court concluded that the claimant was entitled to recover an attorney fee under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-125, which provided for an attorney fee where the claimant's petition was denied but he obtained a favorable award on rehearing.</SPAN></P>

Even though defendant's arrest was illegal, the photograph was not the fruit of the poisonous tree. All evidence was not fruit of the poisonous tree simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of police. There was no evidence tending to show that defendant's arrest was a mere pretext for obtaining his booking photo.

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to consider the testimony of another county's chief public defender because he had not participated in a trial in the county where the inmate was tried. The inmate was not denied effective assistance of counsel because the evidence showed that his trial counsel was aware of and had verified the accuracy of the inmate's arrest record during the sentencing hearing.

The complaint alleged such taxes and fees constituted a denial of the trucking company's privileges and immunities under U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision by the District Court for York County (Nebraska), which sustained defendant parents' motions to quash two informations against them for the intentional abuse of a minor child. The trial court quashed the information against each of them insofar as the prosecution was based on Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-707(1)(a), (c), which the trial court had found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the informations, the State charged each defendant with intentional abuse of a minor child. Each defendant filed a motion to quash the information on the claim that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-707 (Reissue 1989) was vague and, therefore, unconstitutional as a denial or deprivation of due process guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The State contended that defendants lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-707(1)(a), (c) (Reissue 1989). Second, the State asserted that &sect;&sect; 28-707(1)(a), (c) were not void and unconstitutional as a denial or deprivation of a defendant's right to due process relative to a criminal statute which was the basis for prosecution of the defendant. The court found that because punishment for violation of the statute in question created a direct threat to the liberty of defendants, they had standing. However, the statute was found to be constitutional because it supplied sufficient notice concerning the criminal conduct prohibited and was in accordance with due process. The statute was not void for vagueness and its words were used with an ordinary meaning.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it had previously found that other statutes regulating the possession of firearms did not violate the amendment, and that courts in other states had found such statutes not to be unconstitutional, when (as here), the statute regulated or prohibited possession of a weapon that was more likely for a criminal than a law-abiding citizen to possess.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior regulations had allowed Medicaid providers to claim straight-line depreciation on a nursing home's real property as a reimbursable expense if the nursing home operator realized a gain on the sale of real property within one year of its termination as a participant in Medicaid. In 1984, the Department revised the regulations to eliminate all exemptions to the recapture of depreciation. The 1984 regulations applied to the operator. The operator argued that the 1984 change in the regulations deprived it of a property interest without due process of law. The court held that (1) to qualify for the exemption claimed by the operator, the property would have to have been owned for more than 10 years; (2) the operator owned the property for nine years and nine months; (3) even if the court were to hold that the 1984 regulations at issue were unconstitutional and to make the prior rules available to the operator, it would not qualify for the exemption; and (4) because the operator could not benefit from a favorable ruling from the court and could not prove the existence of an actual controversy, no justiciable issue was presented by the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant basically alleged that the district court erred by failing to find the county judge erred: in failing to sustain his motion to quash the complaint on the ground the Neb.

The court ruled that &sect; 28-1310(1)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, however, it reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. In so ruling, the court concluded that the contested jury instruction was erroneous, prejudicial, and required the reversal of defendant's conviction, because it informed the jury that based on &sect; 28-1310(2), defendant's criminal intent had been established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a misdemeanor, entered a plea of not guilty, and the case was set for trial in a county court. The State dismissed the complaint and filed an amended complaint charging defendant with a felony. The county court overruled defendant's objection to the dismissal of the misdemeanor charge and he was bound over to the District Court, Lancaster County (Nebraska), where he pleaded no contest to an amended information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that he was denied due process of law when the county attorney dismissed the original misdemeanor charge and filed a felony complaint, that the refiling of the felony charge prior to trial was prompted solely by defendant's exercising his right to a trial, and demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Defendant also challenged the sentence imposed. The court affirmed. The mere fact that defendant refused to plead guilty and forced the State to prove its case was insufficient to warrant a presumption that subsequent changes in the charging decision were unjustified. Vindictiveness was not shown by evidence that a pretrial decision to modify charges was influenced by the State's hope to obtain a guilty plea. When more than one statute prohibited criminal conduct, the State could select any violated statute as the basis for prosecuting defendant so long as the State's selection was not deliberately based on an unjustifiable standard or arbitrary classification. An order denying probation and a sentence imposed within the statutorily prescribed limits would not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motions to suppress the evidence and convicted defendant of two drug charges. Defendant's pickup truck was condemned in a forfeiture proceeding. The court upheld defendant's convictions but reversed the forfeiture order and remanded for a new trial. The trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the check stop selective. The troopers acted with unchecked discretion when they conducted the check stop selective, which had not been authorized by supervisory personnel. The trial court, however, properly admitted evidence from the search of defendant's property. The affidavit contained detailed observations of marijuana cultivation during an extensive investigation, which provided an ample basis for probable cause even without the brief reference to the vehicle seizure.</SPAN></P>

The district court dismissed the petitions, finding that the company had failed to sustain it burden of proving that the rates established by the municipalities were unjust, unreasonable, and confiscatory. The gas company appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that the scope of its review was de novo on the record made at the various rate hearings because the rate hearings contemplated by the Municipal Gas Regulation Act (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19-4601 to 19-4623 (Reissue 1987), were not quasi-judicial in nature, but were legislative findings that were not subject to review. The court ruled that collateral attack was the only type of judicial review provided by the Act. The court reviewed the judgment of the district court de novo and determined that the gas company established that the rates were arbitrary, unreasonable, and confiscatory because they did not permit the utility to earn a return on the value of the property it employed for the convenience of the public equal to that generally made by other similar business risks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to changes in the telecommunications industry, the state legislature enacted the Act. Under the Act, the Nebraska Public Service Commission (commission) lost the power to regulate the rates set by telecommunication companies except under very limited circumstances. The state brought an action against the companies seeking a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court found the Act to be constitutional, and the state appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the Act did not unconstitutionally divest the commission of its authority to regulate rates under Neb. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20, because the Act constituted &quot;specific legislation&quot; by which the state legislature under &sect; 20 could restrict such authority. The Act did not nullify the commission's jurisdiction, but specifically limited certain powers and prescribed the manner in which the commission should regulate. The Act did not deny due process to telephone customers as to proceedings to review rates, because while the customers had a property right to reasonable rates so that due process was invoked, the procedures provided by the Act for notice and a hearing were adequate and reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of the murder of a man who died after being tortured by defendant and others for three days.

During the trial, evidence regarding the defendant's role in the torture and death of a five year old boy were admitted into evidence. The defendant assigned 60 errors in his appeal of his trial and sentence of death. The court affirmed the judgment and the sentence after considering each assigned error. The court rejected the defendant's argument that his constitutional rights were violated when the trial court dismissed one of his court-appointed attorneys after his trial was completed. The court held that neither the U.S. Constitution nor the state constitution required two attorneys to represent a criminal defendant in a capital case nor did they require that the same attorneys represent the defendant during the trial as on appeal. The court held that the trial court did not err in allowing the child's death into evidence.</SPAN></P>

The liability of parents of children who intentionally inflicted damage to property was a reasonable means to the legitimate state ends of controlling juvenile delinquency and compensating the victims of such delinquency.

Neither the City's clerk nor its law department received a copy of the letter within a year after the accident. The court found that the letter was not a claim; it only alerted to the possibility of a claim. The court pointed out that nothing was filed with the recipient designated under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-905, so the citizen's notice did not substantially comply with the Act. The court opined that purportedly incorrect information the attorney received had no impact on notice, which had been sent to the transportation office six weeks before the conduct claimed as the basis for estoppel, so there could be no reliance. The court concluded that no suspect class or fundamental right was involved, and requiring notice within one year after accrual was not irrational or unreasonably related to protecting important public interests, so there was no state or federal constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar association filed formal charges in the court against the attorney. The disciplinary board found that there were reasonable grounds for discipline and the referee recommended the attorney's suspension from the practice of law. The attorney filed objections to the referee's report. The court entered a judgment of disbarment. The court determined that the attorney should have been disciplined and that the sanction recommended by the referee was inadequate in view of the attorney's actions. The court held that a lawyer was ultimately responsible for the conduct of his employees and associates in the course of the professional representation of the client. The court determined that the attorney was not deprived of due process of law during the Disciplinary Committee hearing. Because the matter was never formally adjudicated, the doctrine of res judicata did not apply. The evidence was clear and convincing that the attorney violated Neb. Ct. R., Code Prof. Resp. DR 6-101(A)(3) and Neb. Ct. R., Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102(A)(6) by his egregious neglect of his client's estate.

Stat. &sect; 40-104 required the notarized signatures of the sellers before they could convey the property, (2) the sellers' uncontested allegation that the property was their homestead was taken as true under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-842 (1985), (3) the evidence showed that the sellers were married, (4) Neb. Rev.

An officer stopped defendant's vehicle for traveling in excess of the speed limit. There was an active warrant for defendant's arrest and the officer conducted a brief inventory search of the vehicle to attempt to secure it. The court held that the search of the unlocked console was not unreasonable under the circumstances. The vehicle was in lawful police custody, although left on the side of the road. The trial court's decision to deny the motion to suppress was not clearly wrong under the circumstances. Defendant also contended that the district court erred in instructing the jury that the presence of the handgun in his vehicle was prima facie evidence that the handgun was in his possession. When instructions were given as to presumptions in a criminal case, those instructions must conform to the requirements of Neb. Evid. R. 303, Neb. Rev.

The trial court found that the statute was constitutional. Affirming, the court held that the statute, by its words, had a secular purpose as it merely made available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend schoolbooks free of charge and the textbooks were secular in nature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother filed a verified petition that she and the putative father had on ongoing sexual relationship during the time of conception. The putative father contended that Neb. Rev.

On appeal, the court noted that the putative father did not contest the reliability or scientific accuracy of the genetic tests. The court found that Neb. Discovery R. Civ. 35 allowed a trial court to order such genetic tests upon an affirmative showing that the condition to be verified by the requested examination was directly involved in the litigation as a material element of the cause of action or defense, was actually controverted, and that good cause existed for ordering the examination.

The court affirmed. The unconstitutionality of a statute had to be clearly established. Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 was merely a declaration of a general fundamental principle. The Nebraska Legislature had the power to abolish rights so long as no vested right was disturbed. No one had a vested interest in any rule of the common law or a vested right in any particular remedy.

Defendant's sentence was also justified on the basis of other information received by the sentencing court. The court was concerned, however, with the statement of the sentencing court that there was no requirement that a sentencing hearing be held unless it was sentencing in a capital case. The court held that a convicted defendant had to be afforded more than a mere opportunity to express an attitude, disposition, or view toward a prospective sentence. A defendant had to be afforded a forum and the right to question, to present countervailing information, and to refute the relevance of information on which the judge could rely.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which affirmed his conviction, following a guilty plea, to driving while under the influence of alcoholic liquor, third offense. The appellate court also affirmed defendant's sentence of 90 days in the county jail, with the exception that it set aside a credit granted by the county court for 30 days' of inpatient treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in sentencing him on a third offense because the evidence as to one prior conviction failed to conform to the date for that conviction alleged in the complaint. The court held that the exact time of the commission of an alleged prior felony was not of the essence of a charge under the Habitual Criminal Act. Thus, the alleged error did not render the information insufficient, where, as here, defendant did not claim surprise or request a continuance, and he was not prejudiced. As to defendant's claim that it was not shown that his guilty pleas on his prior convictions were entered voluntarily and intelligently, the court held that to prove a prior conviction for enhancement purposes the state only needed to show that at the time of the prior conviction defendant had, or waived, counsel. Also, defendant could not collaterally attack a prior conviction in the enhancement proceeding. The issue had to be raised either by a direct appeal from the prior conviction or in separate proceedings commenced expressly for that purpose. Lastly, the court did not err in setting aside the 30 days credit, because the credit was erroneously granted.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed the portion of the district court's order relating to custody of the minor child in its entirety. The court ruled that the district court abused its discretion in retaining legal custody of the parties' minor child, because sufficient information existed in the record to determine whether the husband or the wife should have custody of the parties' minor child. Moreover, the court held that the district court erred in providing for shared physical custody of the minor child absent a determination that such an arrangement was in the best interests of the minor child as required by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-364(3). Lastly, the court held that the district court erred in vesting control over custody in the custody officer, finding that such an arrangement was an unauthorized delegation of judicial authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nebraska legislature enacted 1986 Neb.

Reversing, the court held that the conclusion that L.B. 911 delegated the State's legislative power to the local governing bodies in violation of Neb. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Compact was an agreement between member states concerning placement and care of children, including the placement of children in facilities by parents from across state lines. The DSS told the children's home that it was required to insure that the DSS was informed of the identities of children placed with the home by parents from out of state. The children's home sought a declaratory judgment that the notification requirements of the Compact were not applicable to placements made by nonresident parents. The home also sought an injunction against enforcement of the requirements against the home. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the home. It held that parents had the right to raise and place their children without State interference. The DSS appealed. The court ruled that the clear language of the Compact required that notification of placements be given by the &quot;placement agency&quot; to the proper authorities in any &quot;receiving state.&quot; The Compact's definition of &quot;sending agency&quot; included &quot;person.&quot; The court held that the plain and ordinary meaning of &quot;person&quot; in the Compact included &quot;parent.&quot; The children's home was, therefore, obligated to comply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was up for re-election to the state legislature and was issued a certificate of nomination by the Secretary. A new political party nominated the candidate for the U.S. Senate. The candidate filed with the Secretary an acceptance of that nomination. The Secretary issued an order that the candidate's name would not appear on the ballot for the general election as the nominee for the U.S. Senate. The order stated that the candidate could not run for two offices in the same general election pursuant to &sect; 32-4, 155, and that the nomination was defective because he had not changed his registration to the new party at least 90 days prior to filing his application for nomination, as required by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-515. The candidate filed an action seeking an order allowing him to run for both offices. The court held that although the candidate did not fulfill the 90-day requirement, this provision did not apply to him because he was nominated directly by the party. However, because the candidate could not be a candidate for both state and federal office, if he did not withdraw his federal filing, it would be deemed that he had withdrawn his state filing by inference.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 32-706 (Reissue 1984) appellants had 10 days from the day appellee formally filed his order refusing to place the lottery initiative on the ballot to bring suit contesting that order. Appellants' suit was filed 21 days after appellee's order was filed and was, therefore, 11 days too late under &sect; 32-706. The court held that &sect; 32-706 was not unconstitutional merely for the absence therein of a notice requirement. Section 32-706 did not deny appellants their constitutional right to due process of law. The court held that &sect; 32-706 was not unconstitutional on its face nor unconstitutional in its application to appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation challenged the affirmance of the denial of its applications for liquor licenses at their seven convenience stores. The corporation contended that the district court (1) erred in the interpretation and the construction of the findings and orders of the Commission; (2) erred in determining that the decisions of the Commission were supported by substantial evidence and were not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious; and (3) erred in failing to determine that Lincoln, Neb., Mun. Code &sect; 6.08.100 (1981) violated Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, by creating a discriminatory classification and thereby denying equal protection under the law. As to the first two assignments of error, the court noted that it need not consider the merits as the standard of review for appeals to the court from the Liquor Control Commission was de novo on the record under the Nebraska Administrative Procedure Act as set out in Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-918 (Reissue 1981). With respect third argument, the question was whether &sect; 6.08.100 treated similarly situated classes differently without substantial justification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and taken to jail after he was involved in a vehicle accident. In the morning the defendant was sentenced for driving while intoxicated. Soon after, other officers transported defendant to the central station for questions about a murder that occurred just before defendant's accident. The officers were acting on a tip that they received about the murder. After reaching the station, an officer informed defendant of his Miranda rights. Defendant gave a taped confession to the murder at the meeting. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to suppress his confession because it was the product or &quot;fruit&quot; of an illegal arrest, and in refusing to grant immunity to a defense witness regarding his encounter with defendant on the night of the crime. The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the conviction. The court found that the first assignment of error failed because the officers did not arrest defendant when he was taken for questioning. Because there was no new arrest, legal or otherwise, his confession was not the fruit of an illegal arrest, and the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the confession.</SPAN></P>

The operators argued, inter alia, that the district court erred in finding that they should have timely appealed the application of the 3.75 percent limitation in earlier Medicaid rate computations under the Administrative Procedures Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84-901 et seq., (Reissue 1981 and Cum. Supp. 1984). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgement below. The court applied a de novo standard of review and held that there was no merit to any of the operators' contentions. The court held that it would not have been futile to appeal the application of the limitation. The fact that the Department could not declare &sect; 68-20 unconstitutional was not dispositive because the operators sought retroactive monetary relief, which could only be granted through the state administrative process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court convicted defendant of five counts of false swearing to an initiative or referendum petition contrary to the provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-713 and the court affirmed. The court found that the statutory scheme under which defendant was convicted were not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court properly denied his pretrial motion to dismiss the information on the basis of a violation of equal protection rights because there was no showing of selective prosecution since others similarly situated were prosecuted. The court found defendant's motion for a continuance so that he could review some voluminous reports was properly denied because the reports could have been reviewed in the time allotted. The court affirmed the admission of certain exhibits because although they were prejudicial, they were also of such probative value that their probative value outweighed their potential prejudicial effect. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts and defendant's motion to dismiss was properly denied. The court affirmed the sentence of probation because it was not without authorization.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 32-705 (Cum. Supp. 1986), 32-713 (Reissue 1984). Defendant contended that the court erred in denying his motion to quash and that the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nebraska Taxpayers Lottery Committee was formed by defendant and two other state senators. The committee filed a copy of the form of an initiative petition to allow a state-run lottery. An employee in defendant's office became a bonded circulator in the petition drive for her county. She asked and received defendant's help in securing signatures in his county of residence. After receiving the signatures defendant brought the petition back to the office for the employee to sign as circulator, in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 32-705, 32-713. The court held that the parties' stipulation of facts clearly showed that the employee was not the circulator of the petition, that the employee was not a resident or elector of the county where defendant obtained the signatures, that none of the petitioners signed the petition in her presence, and that she did not explain the legal effect and nature of the petition to any of the petitioners. The court held that it was clear that defendant aided, abetted, and procured the employee's false swearing to the signatures upon the petitions. The evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed the administrative decision de novo. The court held that the notice of the DSS hearing on the matter was reasonable and provided sufficient information regarding the accusation against the owner.

On further appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing certain evidence not disclosed in pretrial discovery to be admitted. The evidence showed that the tax assessor arrived at her valuation of agricultural lands in the county solely by using the Nebraska Agricultural Land Valuation Manual, which was based only on earnings potential arrived at by classification of soil. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-201 (Reissue 1986) required all tangible and real property to be valued at its actual value for purposes of taxation, which meant the same as the market value or the fair market value.

The property owners asserted that the bank's foreclosure of their defaulted mortgage created a &quot;judicial lien&quot; which could have been avoided in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 522(f)(1), notwithstanding the waiver of homestead exemption which the property owners executed as part of their mortgage contract with the bank.

The taxpayers alleged that the statute's non-resident tuition levy constituted taxation without representation, that the statute constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the state department of education, and that to the extent the non-resident tuition charges were permitted to exceed the actual cost of educating non-resident high school students, the non-resident tuition levy violated the state constitution.

The court rejected the State's suggestion that such evidence was properly admitted to show that defendant had the intent to perform violent acts during the robbery. The court ruled that the evidence was an attempt to show character, contrary to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-404(1). The court ruled that the error was prejudicial under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-103 (Reissue 1985). The court could not say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it could not determine how the jury would have evaluated the remaining evidence had it not, in effect, been told that defendant was of bad character in general and deserved punishment for something.

The commissioner denied their claim and the lower court granted the commissioner summary judgment. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment and found that tax refund cases were not capable of being brought as class actions. The court determined that the changes made by the Congress in the Internal Revenue Code permitted the tax of one-half of Social Security benefits paid to individuals who made over a set amount. The court found that the state tax was not an unconstitutional taking because the Congress clearly determined that federal taxation of higher income taxpayer's benefits did not adversely affect the purposes of the Social Security Act. The court concluded that the Congress did not intend to prohibit state taxation of Social Security benefits. The court found that none of the statutes raised by the taxpayers precluded the state from taxing the portion of the taxpayers' benefits reported as federal taxable income.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's home filed a declaratory action, asserting that the DSS regulation in Neb. Admin. Code tit. 474, ch. 6, &sect; 6-005.26K (1983), which prohibited the use of physical punishment in DSS-licensed child-caring agencies, contravened state law, exceeded DSS' authority under state law, established an arbitrary and capricious classification between the regulation of physical punishment in child-caring agencies and that of family day-care homes, and violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The district court ruled that the regulation was void because it exceeded the authority and power granted to DSS under state law. The court reversed, holding that the regulation was promulgated within DSS's rulemaking authority, and that it was a proper expression of the state's parens patriae power to set standards for the care and protection of children. The proscription of physical punishment upon children in child-caring agencies was not arbitrary or capricious because it had been demonstrated that a justifiable reason existed for the difference in treatment between licensed child-caring facilities and family day-care homes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not required to give retroactive operation to the rule. The court held that the inmate was properly sentenced under the rule, which existed at the time.

Respondent had a number of transactions with an individual who was developing land for residential purposes and who was an officer and director of a savings and loan that later had financial difficulties.

Respondent was to have been compensated through an arrangement that involved conveying lots to respondent at a discounted rate. The savings and loan was later declared insolvent. When examined under oath by an assistant attorney general, respondent disclosed the lot sale arrangement but did not disclose that he had received $ 37,500 for his services. Disciplinary actions were then brought against respondent. The counts alleged violations of Neb. Ct. R., Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102, violations of the Nebraska Political Accountability and Disclosure Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 49-1401 et seq. (Reissue 1978, 1984), and violations of respondent's oath as attorney. The court found that respondent withheld disclosure of the fees paid directly by the savings and loan officer and, thus, concealed facts concerning compensation which he had received. Respondent failed to report income from the savings and loan association, as he was required to do. The court concluded that the appropriate discipline was suspension from the practice of law for a period of four years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representative filed an inheritance tax worksheet, which provided tax due to the county was $ 48,375.

The trial court granted the motion and the lower appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the attorneys for the estate and county jointly and deliberately colluded and overstated the amount of inheritance tax due. The court stated the inheritance tax paid the county was impossible on the basis of valuations reported in the inheritance tax worksheet. The court determined that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-2101.01 (1986), which referred to federal tax law in establishing the method of computing state inheritance tax, was based entirely on the Nebraska legislature's power and was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.

Stat. &sect; 46-226.01, which provided for the application for recognition of incidental underground water, did not allow an unconstitutional taking of the landowners' property because the statute did not authorize the taking of one's interest in land but only set forth a procedure for recognizing an appropriator's interest in water incidentally stored underground. The landowners did not present any evidence that the use of their property was interfered with by initiation of this procedure. Further, &sect; 46-226.01 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because the legislature provided reasonable limitations and standards for the department in carrying out its delegated duties.

The trial court granted the real estate broker's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the lawsuit was not brought within the statute of limitations for professional negligence actions in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-222 (Reissue 1985). The issue on appeal was whether the real estate broker was a professional for the purpose of the statute of limitations. The court reversed the summary judgment against the landowner and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that the trial court incorrectly applied &sect; 25-222 to the case because a real estate broker could not be considered a professional for the purpose of the statute of limitations. The court also held that the landowner had not overcome the presumption that &sect; 25-222 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The memorandum allowed inmates to withdraw funds to assist certain listed family members, for canteen purchases, and for deposit in interest bearing accounts of financial institutions. The list of family members included parents, brothers and sisters, children of the inmate, or a spouse. The inmate wanted to withdraw funds to pay a debt to a friend. A portion of the funds on deposit for the inmate were wages he earned in prison. The court affirmed. Neb. Rev. Stat. 83-183(3) (Reissue 1981) limited the use of prison wages for the support of dependents. Thus, the memorandum's limitation to use of the funds to support family members was valid. The restriction also did not violate either the Nebraska Constitution or the U.S. Constitution. There was a valid, rational connection between the challenged portion of the memorandum and the internal security of the prison. That internal security focused on the prevention of the use of the funds to pay illegal debts or tribute to other prisoners. As there was no evidence as to the nature of the debt that the inmate wanted to pay, the restriction was properly applied to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute concerned the adjustment of values of irrigated cropland by the county from those set by the application of the 1986 land manual formula. The county argued that it followed the statutes in adjusting the value of the irrigated cropland and used the methods prescribed and authorized by the statutes. The Board argued that the county acted outside the scope of its statutory authority in making the adjustments. The court held that the record showed the county followed the statutory requirements in decreasing the valuations at issue, and the county adjusted the value of irrigated land within the county to achieve the actual value of such land. The court concluded that such action was within the authority of the county. Therefore, the court held that the Board's finding was erroneous because it permitted agricultural land values to be determined without any requirement that the resulting values be correlated to ensure uniform taxation and relied on statutes which failed to conform to the uniformity clause of the Constitution. Accordingly, the court reversed the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

The district court affirmed the county court's decision. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the adoptive parents failed to meet their burden of proof to show abandonment by the natural father within the meaning of &sect; 43-104(3)(b) because they failed to produce evidence that showed an intentional and complete repudiation and abandonment of the child or a settled purpose to forgo all parental rights. The court also held that Neb. Rev.

Despite an admission by police that the inclusion of the names &quot;John and/or Jane Doe&quot; on the warrant was intended merely as a catchall, defendant's motion to suppress based on an invalid warrant was denied. He was subsequently convicted and he appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that the warrant was invalid under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Neb. Rev.

The inclusion of &quot;John and/or Jane Doe&quot; was not based on probable cause and it established that the warrant was a general warrant that was unconstitutional and defective on its face. Thus, the search was not even valid under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Without the drugs discovered in this unlawful search, the evidence was insufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1463.03(1) (1985), a part of the Child Pornography Prevention Act (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1463.01 through 28-1463.05 (1985). Defendant argued that the trial court erred in determining that the participants in a film were under the age of 16 and that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A suspect being investigated by the police told them that defendant owned a library of pornographic materials that included child pornography. The suspect took a police officer, posing as his friend, to defendant's home and asked defendant to copy a pornographic tape that he took with him. Defendant played a videocassette tape for them to watch while the other tape was being copied. Both tapes showed boys engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Defendant was convicted of violating certain provisions of the Act that prohibited the depiction of sexually explicit conduct in which a child, defined as someone under the age of 16, was a participant or a portrayed observer. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. Defendant argued that the state failed to prove the age of the boys in the tapes. The court noted that although defendant assigned the issue as error, he did not discuss it in his brief, therefore the error was not before the court on appeal. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad, holding that one who engaged in conduct that was clearly prohibited could not complain that the statute was vague when applied to the conduct of others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police executed a warrant for a search of defendant's residence in which they were authorized to search for growing marijuana plants and a fully automatic machine gun. No one was at home, and an officer gained access to the residence through a window. The warrant did not contain a direction that notice was not required prior to gaining entry to the house, and there was no evidence that the officers knocked and announced their authority and purpose before entry into the house. In searching for the machine gun, the officers found a sawed off shotgun. The court held that a nonconsensual and unannounced entry by a police officer for execution of a search warrant within an unoccupied dwelling was not, by itself and necessarily, an unreasonable intrusion prohibited by the fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Thus, the entry and consequent search of defendant's residence was not unreasonable. The court further held that the officers were acting within the scope of their authority under the search warrant when they discovered the sawed off shotgun. The court held that there was no prejudice to defendant resulting from consolidation of trials on the three informations against him.</SPAN></P>

The elderly woman and her attorneys claimed that the elderly woman did not require a guardian. The guardian appealed the district court's refusal to issue letters of appointment. The court agreed that the elderly woman needed a guardian, but limited the guardian's power to procuring an accounting of the assets, thereby mooting the guardian's appeal. The elderly woman, who was unable to care for herself and unable to manage her assets, was an &quot;incapacitated person&quot; within the meaning of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-2619. The elderly woman did not have a constitutional right to counsel during a psychiatric examination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision from the District Court for Hitchcock County (Nebraska), which convicted defendant of theft. Defendant contended that the theft statutes were unconstitutionally vague, that he should have had a preliminary hearing on the amended charges of theft by deception, that the State failed to prove venue, and that the district court erred in instructing the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a scheme to defraud a company in the transfer of grain. The appellate court reversed on the issue of jury instructions. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-510 (Reissue 1985), several different crimes were consolidated under the crime of theft. That statute and the related theft statutes were not unconstitutionally vague. While the statute grouped certain crimes, defendant still had the opportunity to determine the exact type of theft he was charged with in time for trial. The preliminary charge of theft was sufficient to bind defendant after the preliminary hearing because at the time of the crime, theft was a single offense regardless of the type of theft. Further, the statute on theft by deception, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-512(2) (Reissue 1987), was not vague because men of common intelligence understood its meaning. While the State did not directly establish venue as required, sufficient evidence was admitted so that venue was established indirectly or by inference. There was plain error in failing to instruct the jury on the class of theft that defendant committed. The value of stolen property determined whether the theft was a felony or a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of theft in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-511(1) (1985), after he cashed two checks belonging to a corporation regarding a real estate sales transaction. Pursuant to an agreement with the United States and State of Nebraska, defendant was to testify truthfully, and would not be prosecuted by the United States, and would not be charged with additional crimes by Nebraska, other than the two theft counts. Defendant was found guilty, and appealed his conviction, claiming that the state statute was vague, and that the prosecutor violated the agreement by submitting evidence obtained by his immunized testimony. The court held that the state's theft statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because it was clear and precise and did not prohibit the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct. The court noted that the theft statute condemned only conduct in which criminal intent was present, and distinguished otherwise permissible noncriminal conduct. Finally, the court concluded that the prosecutor successfully proved that evidence presented at court was not derived from defendant's immunized testimony, and upheld the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was more than sufficient to justify the case being submitted to the jury and more than sufficient for the jury to have found the defendant guilty of felony murder. The court further held that defendant was never placed in double jeopardy, the photographic identification was not unduly suggestive, and that his argument that he was denied a speedy trial was likewise without merit. Finally, the court held that the record established beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder manifested exceptional depravity, that aggravating circumstance existed beyond a reasonable doubt, and there was nothing in the record which would support a finding that mitigating circumstance existed.

Further, the court rejected defendant's contention that Neb. Rev.

Additionally, defendant argued that he lacked the intent to defraud because he had a line of credit with another bank to cover checks drawn on the bank and he had credit due pursuant to an insurance claim. The court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-611(4) created a presumption that the drawer of an insufficient check, who did not honor the check, intended to defraud the drawee.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-906(1) (Reissue 1985) at the other proceeding. The district courts affirmed both convictions. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that he had a constitutionally protected right to a trial by jury under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, concluding that a second offense driving while intoxicated qualified as a petty offense. The court also rejected defendant's argument that he was denied equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18 because he would have been entitled to a jury trial if he had been charged under the state statute rather than under the city's ordinance. In connection with the obstruction conviction, the court held that evidence that defendant resisted the attempts to handcuff him and struggled with the arresting officer, were sufficient to sustain both the State's burden of proof and the subsequent conviction by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that at common law a husband could not have been found guilty of raping his wife and that the common law applied. The trial court quashed the information on the ground that defendant was the victim's legal spouse at the time of the indictment. The court rejected defendant's argument that Nebraska had adopted the common-law spousal exclusion to its rape statutes. The court found that under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;29-2315.01, first-degree sexual assault was an act of violence, not a sexual act of an ardent husband performed upon an initially apathetic wife. The court determined that by repealing the rape statutes and enacting such a radically different first degree sexual assault statute, the legislature intended to abrogate any common-law assumptions concerning the crime of rape. The court concluded that the trial court erred in sustaining defendant plea in abatement and quashing the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association's members were engaged in a business under which they, for a fee, accepted, transported, and delivered money to purchase parimutuel tickets at licensed racetracks within and outside of the State of Nebraska for and on behalf of clients who were unable to be personally present at the racetracks. Section 2-1221 proscribed such conduct, making it a misdemeanor. The association contended that &sect; 2-1221 was unconstitutional because it (1) impaired the right of members of the association to freely contract with their clients, (2) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and (3) denied equal protection. In affirming the district court's order, the court first ruled that contract rights were not absolute and that they could be subject to regulation in the common interest. The court found that the messenger service activities were so intertwined with gambling that the State could regulate or prohibit the activity if the legislation was reasonably related to legitimate state ends. Because there was a reasonable relationship, the activities were not constitutionally protected. The statute was not overbroad and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

As a result, defendant received a death sentence on the murder charge and a consecutive sentence of not less than 16 nor more than 50 years on the robbery charge. The district court denied his action for postconviction relief. In affirming the district court's judgment, the court rejected defendant's argument that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2006(3), the excusal for cause statute, violated the federal or statute constitutions. The court ruled that the statute constitutionally permitted the removal for cause of a prospective juror whose views on capital punishment were such as to prevent or substantially impair the performance of his or her duties as a juror. Moreover, the court held that defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, was not violated by the district court's en masse voir dire examination. Lastly, the court held that the comparative review procedure set forth in Neb. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-310(1)(b) (Reissue 1985). The juvenile court held that &sect; 28-310(1)(b) was unconstitutionally vague and dismissed the proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile and a companion went onto the grounds of a school. A teacher asked them to leave. The teacher grabbed the companion's bicycle and again told the boys to leave. The juvenile got off his bicycle, and according to the teacher, threatened to strike him with his fist and simulated karate-like motions, saying that he would hurt the teacher if he did not leave him and his companion alone. The juvenile claimed that he simulated the karate kick because the teacher would not return the bicycle. Section 28-310(1)(b) provided that one committed a third degree assault if he threatened another in a menacing manner. The court granted the State's exception and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that: (1) &sect; 28-310(1)(b) was not overbroad because it did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct; (2) the statute was not impermissibly vague because it provided ascertainable standards of guilt so as to inform those subject to it of the conduct that would render them liable for punishment; and (3) based on the juvenile's version of the facts, his conduct fell squarely within the prohibition of &sect; 28-310(1)(b).</SPAN></P>

The corporation alleged, in so far as the amendment prohibited such activities, it was void as violating the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutions. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the official, but held that one sentence under the amendment conflicted with the National Bank Act and was void under the supremacy clause. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed. The court held that no provision of the amendment was void. The court found that the amendment did not conflict with &sect; 92. The court opined that national banks were governed in their daily activities by state laws.

Defendant's first and second motions for postconviction relief were denied. The court affirmed finding that, although evidence suggested that a juror's improper conduct with the codefendant's attorney affected the jury's failure to reach a verdict in the codefendant's case, the misconduct did not prejudice defendant because there was overwhelming evidence that defendant murdered a civilian and shot two police officers after his codefendant surrendered. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the first postconviction proceeding failed because, even assuming that counsel's performance was substandard, there was no showing of prejudice where there was no showing that the state offered any plea arrangement that defendant or the court would have accepted. Even if defendant's juvenile record was considered in imposing the death sentence, such error was harmless because his adult record provided sufficient aggravating circumstances. The imposition of the death penalty was not cruel and unusual because defendant perpetrated the murders in the course of the felony commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer commenced a class action seeking declaratory judgment that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-4,102 (Cum.

In his first count, the taxpayer alleged that the statute was unconstitutional because it improperly delegated legislative authority. In his second count, the taxpayer requested that the court issue an injunction prohibiting the collection of tuition taxes. The trial court overruled the demurrer of the school districts but granted the school districts' motion for summary judgment, finding that the taxpayer's action was rendered moot by the enactment of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-4,102 (Cum. Supp. 1984), which repealed Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-4,102 (Cum. Supp. 1982). The trial court properly denied the demurrer on the first count because an action for declaratory relief was an appropriate proceeding to test the constitutionality of a tax statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was notified of the birth and visited the mother shortly afterwards. The father asserted that he did not execute a consent to an adoption or relinquishment.

The court maintained that the state had a compelling interest in the well being of all children, whether born in or out of wedlock, and of their proper nurture and care. The court stated that the transfer of children by relinquishment from unwed mothers and the adoption of those children were also compelling state interests. The court found that the father did not establish that the termination of his parental rights was violative of due process because he exhibited no financial responsibility for the child or the mother until after the birth. Additionally, the court held that it was not impressed with the excuse that the father did not know of the statutory five-day limitation as the father was presumed to know the law. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that the trial court was correct in denying the salesman a jury trial because the Act was equitable in nature. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the salesman a continuance of the commencement of trial under the circumstances. The court found that the amount of the attorney fee awarded to the state was not an abuse of discretion because it was the prevailing party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court dismissed the arrestee's complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Appellees sought dismissal of the petition in error that the arrestee filed in the district court on the grounds that it failed to state a cause of action and that the arrestee did not have authority to proceed without payment of fees. The district court agreed with appellees. On further appeal, appellees argued that the district court had no jurisdiction to preview the county court's judgment in a proceeding in error and that it was mandatory to follow the appeal procedure set out in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-541.02 (Cum. Supp. 1982). The court agreed and upheld the district court's judgment. 1974 Neb. Laws 733 eliminated proceedings in error as a method of obtaining district court review of a decision rendered by a county court. Thus, the appeal procedure was exclusive. Further, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-541.02 (Cum. Supp. 1982) was neither vague nor overbroad. The arrestee had the right to represent himself, but he had to follow the same rules that applied to other litigants, regardless of his lesser knowledge of the mechanics of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which reversed a municipal court's conviction of defendant for driving while under the influence of alcohol on the ground that the evidence of defendant's intoxication had been obtained as the result of an unconstitutional seizure of his person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers set up a transitory checkpoint, at which every fourth vehicle reaching it would be stopped on the pretext of checking the operator's license and the vehicle registration. The actual purpose of the stops, however, was to determine whether the operator of the vehicle emitted an odor of alcohol, in which event further investigation would follow. Defendant was driving one of the fourth cars to reach the checkpoint and there was no other reason that defendant was stopped. The officer making the stop detected the odor of alcohol on defendant's breath and gave defendant a sobriety test, which defendant failed. On appeal, the court held that defendant was unreasonably seized in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The uncontradicted evidence before the court was that there was no plan formulated at the policymaking level of the police department or elsewhere, which considered, weighed, and balanced the applicable factors. The court found that defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy was rendered subject to arbitrary invasion solely at the unfettered discretion of officers in the field.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10. In addition, it deprived the employees of property without due process of law and denied equal protection of the laws in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court on appeal held that the employees failed to show &quot;impairment&quot; of contract by being unable to show how the situation had been made worse than what existed when their rights were created. The employees also failed to show how any property that they originally had was taken from them, which was the first step in a due process analysis. The employees equal protection claim also failed because the evidence disclosed that all employees were treated alike, to the extent that employees could be treated alike. Any differences did not constitute a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the court held that police officer had probable cause to arrest defendant based on the officer's observation of defendant's operation of the his vehicle, the smell of alcohol about defendant, defendant's glassy, blood shot eyes, and defendant's inability to complete any of the field sobriety tests. The court further held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol.

After an administrative hearing, the Director revoked the driver's operator's license because of his unreasonable refusal to take the test. The trial court rejected the driver's contention that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-669.16 was unconstitutional and upheld the revocation. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the Director was authorized by Neb. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 39-669.16 (Reissue 1984) was sufficiently clear and the legislature was empowered to craft legislation that became operative on stated contingencies. The court found no impropriety in the destruction of a tape of the revocation hearing and reiterated that Miranda warnings were not required in implied consent cases.

As such, it did not need to be imposed uniformly and proportionately.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-669.07 (Reissue 1984), for driving while under the influence of alcohol, third offense. The trial court, pursuant to &sect; 39-669.07(3), sentenced defendant to 120 days in the county jail, a $ 500 fine plus costs, and permanent revocation of his driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 39-669.07. Specifically, he argued that the statute deprived him of equal protection of the law, due process of law, and the right to travel. Defendant's challenges mainly focused on &sect; 39-669.07(3)'s language providing for permanent revocation of an operator's license upon the individual's third drunk driving conviction, because the statute had no exemption for those who required private motor vehicle transportation to, from, or during their employment. Holding that intoxicated drivers were not a protected class, the court used the rational relation standard of review to determine that the statute did not violate equal protection guarantees. Noting that defendant had received a full trial, with representation of counsel, the court found no deprivation of defendant's right to due process either. The court also found that the statute did not deprive defendant of the right to interstate travel, but merely the ability to travel by driving a car himself. The court also rejected defendant's claims that his punishment was so disproportionate to his crime as to be cruel and unusual under the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, while the record would have supported the contention that the annexation ordinance was not submitted to a planning board pursuant to Neb. Rev.

Section 19-3101 only afforded persons residing outside of the boundaries of a metropolitan city, but within the three-mile zoning area, an opportunity to make recommendations as to how the land outside of the boundaries should have been regulated and how the land was to be used.

The jury observed the defendant throughout the trial, and they could consider the physical appearance of the defendant if there was other evidence as to his age. The court held that the testimony of the victim established the other elements of the crime.

The court concluded that the property owners acquired the right to maintain the mobile home on the land when they purchased it, but their removal of that original mobile home forfeited the right because the ordinance provided that discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of two years forfeited the right to thereafter reestablish the nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also issued a mandatory injunction requiring that the city issue the citizens a well permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance which set forth the requirements for having a well permit issued. Subsequently, the city enacted a resolution that barred the issuance of well permits for a time due to the city's debt in installing a water system. The citizens applied for and were denied a permit for a well within the city and brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the resolution. The trial court declared that the resolution was unconstitutional and ordered the city to issue a permit to the citizens. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance providing for the issuance of well permits could only be repealed through a comparable enactment, which would be another ordinance. Since the city had enacted a resolution barring the issuance of the permits, the court found that the latter had not affected the citizens' rights under the former. The court ruled that, although the trial court had reached its conclusion based on the wrong analysis, its decision regarding the citizens' right to a permit was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to order the city to issue the citizens a permit for a well within the city, but based their decision upon different grounds than the trial court, declining to rule on the constitutionality of the city's resolution barring the issuance of well permits.</SPAN></P>

When the client found out that defendant had been suspended she authorized the police to install a transmitter in her home so that a conversation between her and defendant could be heard by the police. The police also photocopied a $ 50 to be given to defendant by the client. After defendant left the client's home, he was stopped and arrested. The $ 50 was found in his pocket and matched the photocopy. Defendant contended that his conviction was improper under Neb. Rev.

He argued that the crime was not completed because his arrest occurred prior to the filing of the adoption pleading.

The state appealed further and the state supreme court granted review. Defendant contended, among other things, that the failure of &sect; 39-669 to limit the proscription as to careless driving to the public roads amounted to impermissible overbreadth and resultant unconstitutionality. In a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a law, if the state supreme court could determine that the prohibition contained in the enactment did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, then the overbreadth challenge had to fail. Defendant had cited no case which held that driving in a careless manner was in any way protected conduct under either the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of Nebraska, nor had the state supreme court's independent research disclosed any such authority.

(Reissue 1984), which prohibited a person from acquiring a beneficial interest in more than a total of two alcoholic beverage retail licenses, with exceptions for certain city-owned facilities, large chain hotels, bowling establishments, and restaurants. The court held that as the classifications in Neb. Rev.

The court held that because the informant consented to the recording of the conversations between him and defendant, the communication interception statutes did not prohibit the interception of those conversations by the police. Regarding defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court stated that throughout the course of the trial, defendant's counsel, now deceased, was assisted by a second attorney. The second attorney testified at the post conviction hearing that defendant's attorney proceeded in a professional manner at all times.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy filed an action in federal court against the auditor on civil rights and state law claims stemming from his termination. Reinstatement or payment of limited salary was ordered. The federal court certified two questions, which the court accepted. The court reaffirmed its determination made subsequent to certification that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20-148 (1977) did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity by the State of Nebraska for actions brought in federal court under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In regard to the second question, whether precedent indicated that the State of Nebraska waived sovereign immunity for actions brought in federal court on claims arising out of contracts, the court answered in the negative. It did not follow from the state's consent to be sued in its own courts that it waived its immunity in federal court.

SID entered into a contract with the city for water and sewer service to be provided to the SID by the city at rates to be prescribed by ordinances of the city, but not to exceed twice the fees charged to the city's residents. The resident argued that the rate that the city had fixed was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unfairly discriminatory, because the higher fees were based solely upon the fact that &quot;users&quot; were nonresidents of the city. The court affirmed the grant of the city's motion for summary judgment. The court found that the furnishing by a city of water or sewer service to persons outside the city limits was contractual and permissive and not a duty imposed upon the city by statute. The court stated that statutory provisions that required the city to furnish service, subject to reasonable rules and regulations, applied only to residents of the city. The court held that public utilities generally could discriminate, in respect to rates, between consumers within and outside of the municipalities primarily served.</SPAN></P>

The court found no indication that defendant wished to end the questioning merely because he slid his chair against the wall, stuck his feet out, slouched, rested his head against the wall, closed his eyes, crossed his arms, and remained silent.

The court found no evidence that there was a systematic exclusion of persons between the ages of 19 and 34 from the jury. The court reasoned that the degree of underrepresentation on a jury panel could not have been measured by census data alone. The court found the felony murder law, Neb. Rev. Stat.

A lower appellate court affirmed the conviction, but modified defendant's sentence from 75 to 20 days. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that the ordinance did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct where the ordinance was construed to apply to punish only the use of &quot;fighting words.&quot; The court held that the statements made by defendant in which he used expletive words towards a police officer constituted fighting words because their utterance inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. The court rejected defendant's argument that a police officer was somehow less susceptible to abuse than other members of the general public. The court concluded that defendant did not have standing to challenge the ordinance for being vague where he engaged in conduct that was clearly proscribed by the ordinance and could not complain of the vagueness of the ordinance as applied to the conduct of others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 35 years in imprisonment without the possibility of parole upon his guilty plea to sexual assault in the first degree. The trial court had enhanced the sentence because he had previously been sentenced for first degree sexual assault. On appeal, defendant presented the issue of whether the sentence was so excessive so that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court considered the factors for evaluating whether a sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court first noted that the crime of rape was a serious offense. Next, the court looked at the sentences authorized in Nebraska for other crimes and the sentences imposed for the commission of similar crimes in other states. The court found that the sentence imposed in this case for a second offense of first degree sexual assault was not disproportionate.

Stat. &sect; 21-1509 et seq. favored the corporation's position by exempting it from insurance provisions that conflicted with the legislation that enabled it. The court ruled that the policy favoring free alienability of choses in action was subordinate to the policy favoring the freedom to contract in this context. The nonassignment clause was important in persuading health care providers to participate in the corporation's physician's cost effectiveness program and accept set fees for health services, limiting health care costs and passing that savings on to the corporation's subscribers, which was more important than preserving free alienability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's life insurance policy had been changed to an annual renewable term policy that did not contain an aviation exclusion. The insured was killed when his plane he was piloting crashed. The insurer contended that the insured made a material misrepresentation of fact when he stated on the application he had made no aerial flights in the past two years, nor contemplated such flights, when he had actual flown a month earlier. The court affirmed the decision, finding that the jury could reasonably deduct that the flight the insured took with the flight instructor was nothing other than a civilian passenger flight. There was evidence that the insured's interest in flying was rekindled after the policy had gone into effect. Thus, the jury could find that the insured answered the question truthfully. The insurer had the burden to prove that any misrepresentation made by the insured was made with the intent to deceive the insurer. The court ruled that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-359, in regard to attorney fees, did not create classifications that violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, or the special law clause of the Neb. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a nonjury trial, defendant was convicted of pandering and was sentenced to 18 months' probation with confinement for the first 60 days and final 30 days of the probationary period. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found defendant could not successfully challenge Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-802 (Reissue 1979) as being unconstitutionally vague where defendant was engaging in conduct that was clearly proscribed by &sect; 28-802. The court held that &sect; 28-802 did not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection on the basis that it contained a more severe penalty than the crime of prostitution where the more sever penalty was reasonably and rationally related to the legitimate governmental purposes of protecting the public and suppressing commercialized vice. The court concluded there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's conviction where the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was engaged in the business of recruiting men to pay for the sexual services of woman in his stable. The court noted in an undercover investigation defendant had agreed to procure two women for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity for a price.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a client and his company, challenged an order of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) that sustained a demurrer and dismissed the legal malpractice action against appellees, an attorney and his law firm, on the ground that any cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-222 (Reissue 1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action filed on August 25, 1982 alleged legal malpractice in the attorney's representation of the client. In 1978, the client retained the attorney to prosecute the action. The opposing party filed a motion to make the petition more definite and certain. The trial court allowed the client two weeks to amend the petition. The attorney never filed the amendment. He withdrew in 1980 and another attorney took over the representation. On August 26, 1980 the trial court dismissed the suit for failure to comply with the order. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-222 (Reissue 1979) provided that an action to recover for professional negligence should be filed two years after the alleged act and if the action was not discoverable, one year from the date of discovery. The court reasoned that the alleged negligence occurred when the attorney failed to amend the petition in November 1978. Thus, the statute of limitations began to run in 1980, at the earliest on July 3 and at the latest on August 26, when the client was charged with knowledge or actually discovered that the attorney failed to prosecute the action. The time limit had expired at the time the malpractice action was filed. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for terroristic threat and robbery. These were two separate offenses occurring at different times with different victims. Defendant was convicted on April 14, 1983 on the terroristic threat charge and sentenced on May 20, 1983. On June 9, 1983, he was sentenced on the robbery charge which had been reduced to felon in possession of a firearm. The sentences on both offenses were to run concurrently. Subsequently, the court found the terroristic threat statute to be unconstitutional. Defendant filed a motion for post conviction relief seeking to be given credit for the time between his conviction of terroristic threat and his sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The trial court denied the motion and defendant appealed. On appeal, the court determined that despite the fact that one of his convictions was invalid, defendant was properly denied credit for time served on that conviction to be applied to the later conviction. The court also determined, however, that defendant should have been granted credited for the time between his conviction for terroristic threat and the time he was sentenced on that charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant questioned the validity of the interceptions of certain telephonic conversations and the sufficiency of the evidence. The interception order and amended order provided that interceptions would be valid for a total of one 30-day period and were not to automatically terminate when the described communications were first obtained. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that: (1) Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86-705 did not require interceptions to cease upon the obtaining of a described communication unless the order authorizing them so provided, but only stated that they had to cease when the objective of the authorization was achieved, whether the order so stated or not, and could not extend beyond 30 days; (2) the failure of the orders to require by their own language that the interceptions terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective was not fatally defective because substantial, but not strict, compliance with &sect; 86-705 was required; and (3) the presence of the controlled substances in defendant's residence and the lack of a reasonable explanation therefor was sufficient to establish defendant's illegal possession of the controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

As part of the statutory scheme the director of health was to adopt and promulgate rules and regulations governing application for a grant or contract. The university submitted a contract proposal to the director of health who refused to process it because the university was not owned or exclusively controlled by the State of Nebraska or one of its political subdivisions. The university sought a writ of mandamus compelling the director of health, to consider the university's contract proposal. The trial court granted the writ of mandamus. The director of health and the attorney general appealed. The court affirmed and held that while the university might derive an indirect benefit from a research contract with the state, the possible indirect benefit does not transform payments for contracted services into an appropriation of public funds proscribed by Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11. The primary purpose and principal objective of the state's contract regarding cancer research was improved public health in Nebraska.</SPAN></P>
