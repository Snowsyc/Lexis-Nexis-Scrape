The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, from which plaintiff appealed. The court held that the plain language of 730 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a mother on behalf of herself and her daughter, brought a personal injury action against defendants, a city and a crossing guard. Plaintiffs alleged that the daughter was injured when a vehicle struck her while she crossed a street manned by defendant crossing guard. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss all allegations against them. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred in finding that defendants' conduct was immunized under &sect; 4-102 of the Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat.10/4-102 (1996). Defendants contended that &sect; 4-102 granted them immunity from precisely that type of cause of action. The court held that the plain language of &sect; 4-102 stated that a municipality and its employees could not be liable for their failure to provide adequate police protection or service and found this language controlling. Therefore, plaintiffs' allegations fell within the police protection services that were part of the common law &quot;public duty&quot; rule and that were codified in &sect; 4-102. Therefore, because the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs' complaint, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, board of managers of a condominium association, alleged that defendants, limited partnerships, owed plaintiffs a fiduciary duty to budget, collect and set aside reasonable reserves for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance for the repair or replacement of common elements, and that defendants failed to establish reasonable reserves for the replacement of capital improvements. Defendants should have known that plaintiffs' obligations could not be met without an adequate contribution of reserve funds. Plaintiffs adequately pled damages; the facts established that the money plaintiffs had in reserve was an unreasonably small amount in relation to their needs, and what constituted reasonable reserves should have been determined by the trier of fact. Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/1 et seq. (1996).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendants used various noisemakers to stop the plaintiffs, hunt club members, from hunting geese. The plaintiffs, under the authority of Hunter Interference Prohibition Act, (Act) 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 125/2, obtained a permanent injunction against the defendants. The injunction prohibited the defendants from interfering with hunters engaged in the lawful taking of wild animals. The defendants moved to dissolve the injunction and to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim. They argued that the remaining portion of the statute was an unconstitutional infringement on speech. The court affirmed the permanent injunction and found the Act was constitutional because the statute was a reasonable restriction on the time, place, and manner of protected speech; that the restriction was content neutral; and that there were alternative methods of communication available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from the judgment of Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), dismissing his complaint and determining that the Cook County (Illinois) Amusement Tax Ordinance was not an occupational tax, prohibited by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e), and its exemptions were reasonable and did not violate the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, or the equal protection clauses, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer purchased a movie ticket and paid the required amusement tax, thereby establishing standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Cook County (Illinois) Amusement Tax Ordinance. Defendant county officials moved to dismiss plaintiff's subsequent complaint for lack of standing and failure to state a claim under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5/2-615 and 5/2-619. Plaintiff was found to have standing, but the complaint was dismissed. Plaintiff appealed. In affirming in part, the court ruled that the tax imposed was not an occupational tax that was prohibited by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e), and the exemptions to the tax scheme did not violate the equal protection clauses, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, since there was a rational basis for the exemptions. Also, those exemptions that were granted for patrons of non-commercial organizations that served the community were reasonable and did not violate the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, as special administrator of the estate of the deceased, filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the county, the county hospital, two doctors, and three nurses. Plaintiff alleged that defendants failed to order a mammogram, failed to diagnose decedent's condition of breast cancer, and failed to perform examinations on decedent. Defendants moved for summary judgment, contending that they were immune from liability under 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/6-105 (1992)(Tort Immunity Act). Two of the nurses were dismissed as defendants. The trial court granted summary judgment to the remaining defendants. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that defendants were not immune from liability. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in defendant's favor. The court found defendants were immune from liability under 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/6-105, because it provided immunity to local public entities and public employees who failed to make a physical or mental examination or failed to make an adequate physical or mental examination. The court disagreed with plaintiff that immunity was limited to preventive public heath examinations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and armed robbery and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of one hundred years and thirty years, respectively. Defendant contended that he should have been granted a new trial because he was taking psychotropic medication during the trial, but never received a fitness hearing. He also contended that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense of armed robbery took place in Cook County, as charged in the indictment. The court held that the record proved that the trial court did everything that it possibly could to further investigate defendant's fitness for trial. The trial court ordered a fitness exam and defendant was found fit to stand trial. During numerous and protracted post-trial proceedings, the trial court repeatedly told defendant and defense counsel that there was no indication observed by the trial court or brought to its attention by any party that defendant was ever unable to cooperate with defense counsel or that defendant was unable to comprehend the nature of the proceedings. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed action against three physicians, alleging negligence in failing to diagnose prostate cancer. Plaintiff dismissed the claims against two defendants. The remaining defendant moved for summary judgment, stating that plaintiff filed his lawsuit after both the applicable statute of limitations and statute of repose expired. The circuit court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed, finding that because the case was failure-to-diagnose, the omission was deemed to have occurred on the date defendant rendered his final treatment. Plaintiff testified that he never received any treatment from defendant after June of 1992. Therefore, plaintiff's claim was extinguished in June of 1996, two months before he filed his complaint. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that the four-year statute of repose for medical malpractice actions barred plaintiff's complaint. The court also disagreed with plaintiff that the statute of repose, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-212(a), was forbidden special legislation and violated state and federal constitutional rights, including access to the courts, equal protection, and due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee slipped and fell while working at defendant store. Plaintiff filed a negligence action against defendants, store and general contractor. Defendant general contractor filed a third-party contribution action against plaintiff's employer.

The lower court apportioned liability with 70 percent to defendant general contractor and 30 percent to defendant store. Defendant store appealed, alleging that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to apportion liability. The court agreed and reversed the apportionment order. The court held that the lower court did not have jurisdiction, nor the authority to apportion liability between these two defendants because defendant general contractor never cross-claimed against defendant store for contribution. The court held that without a formal pleading putting the question of liability between the defendants at issue, the court lacked the authority to apportion liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a convicted child molester, entered a school for getting permission to distribute literature about his disk jockey business. Defendant was convicted of violating 720 ILCS 5/11-9.2, which prohibited entry of school property, by a child sex offender. Defendant appealed his conviction, and the court affirmed. Defendant challenged his conviction on both procedural and substantive due process grounds. The court disagreed that defendant's procedural due process rights were violated because there was no right, inherent or constitutional, to transact personal business on public school property. The court also found no violation of defendant's substantive due process rights because under that rational basis test, the law was reasonable related to the purpose of protecting school children from known child sex offenders. The court also dismissed defendant's argument that the law was vague as applied to him. A law was vague only when persons of normal intelligence must guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for violating law which prohibited entry of school property by a child sex offender was affirmed because neither defendant's procedural or substantive due process rights were violated. Entry onto public school property to transact personal business was not a protected activity. Also, the law was a reasonable means of protecting the legitimate government interest of protecting school children from sex offenders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held that an increase in paid-in capital from push-down accounting adjustments to plaintiff's balance sheet after a stock sale and a 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 338 election was a statutory increase in paid-in capital for franchise tax purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation protested its payment of an assessment for franchise taxes following a stock sale between plaintiff's former and new sole shareholder that increased plaintiff's paid-in capital by nearly $ 58 million. The court affirmed the order, finding that an increase in paid-in capital from push-down accounting adjustments to a corporation's balance sheet after a stock sale and a 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 338 election was a statutory transfer to paid-in capital and subject to franchise tax under 806 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1.80(j) (1.80(j)) (1996). The court held that because there was an increase in paid-in capital, there was sufficient shareholder action to meet the 5/1.80(j) requirements. The court found that paid-in capital included amounts added or transferred into the paid-in capital account by internal transactions. The court noted that the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970), was not violated because all domestic corporations paid franchise taxes, and therefore 5/1.80(j) applied to all corporations when determining the amount of paid-in capital. The court held that this was a rational system of capitalization and a proper basis to determine the franchise tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff partnerships filed two actions against defendant government agencies, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent an alleged retroactive application of Public Act 89-448 (Act), which was an amendment to the Retail Rate Law, 220 ILCS 5/8-403.1. The Act abolished subsidies for tire burning plants. As a result, plaintiffs, who burned tires, were no longer entitled to be paid the retail rate for electricity they generated. Plaintiffs argued that without the retail rate, their plants could not meet daily operating expenses. The lower court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court held that the counts that were dismissed which sought to enjoin state action were improperly dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds. The court of claims, which the lower court found had jurisdiction, had no power to construe the constitutionality of a statute. The court affirmed dismissal counts that were premature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four counts of attempted murder, three counts of aggravated battery with a firearm, and one count of aggravated discharge of a firearm after he fired shots inside a restaurant at victims whom he believed smashed his car window. Defendant testified that he was fearful that two of the victims were going to shoot him, so he pulled out a revolver and started shooting. Three of the four people defendant confronted were shot. Defendant brought several errors. One contention was that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the doctrine of transferred intent as it applied to defendant's self-defense claim against two of the victims. Defendant argued that he shot two victims in self-defense because he thought they were reaching for weapons. Defendant contended that the court should have instructed the jury to transfer defendant's self-defense intent to the unintended victims. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Assuming that the trial court should have given a transferred intent instruction, there was no prejudice because the jury rejected the defendant's theory of self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on a school playground swinging an axe back and forth. Defendant was charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. During trial, one expert testified that defendant was insane at the time of the alleged offense and was not fit to stand trial. In rebuttal, Plaintiff State of Illinois had an expert testify that that defendant had the ability to understand the nature of the criminality of his acts and had the ability to conform his behavior to the requirements of law. The trial court rejected defendant's insanity defense and found him guilty but mentally ill. Defendant appealed. Defendant argued that application of the newly amended insanity statute, which required defendant to prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a preponderance, as was required under the prior statute, violated the ex post facto clause of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 10; Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1970). The court reversed the judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial because the amended insanity statute, requiring a higher burden of proof, was not in effect at the time of trial and therefore application of the amendment constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee village employed appellant fire fighter. Appellant sustained an injury during the course of his employment, and filed multiple applications for adjustment of his claim under the Worker's Compensation Act (Act), 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 305/1 et seq. (1996). The lower court denied the claims because they were barred as appellee enacted a statute under the authority of 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/22-306 (1996), which prevented appellant from seeking recovery under the Act. Appellant sought review, arguing that the amended version of 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/22-307 (1996) applied to his case. The amended statute would allow for appellant's claim under the Act. In affirming, the appellate court rejected appellant's arguments and held that the amendment was a change in the law, and not a clarification; thus, it had no application to the present case. The court found that 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/22-306 (1996) gave appellee the power to enact its statute limiting recovery by a fire fighter, and the legislative history surrounding the amendment to 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/22-307 (1996) revealed that the legislature sought to change the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's worker's compensation benefits. Amendments to the law that would allow appellee to also recover worker's compensation benefits were inapplicable because a former statute in effect at the time of appellant's claim, which limited his recovery, was controlling.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further argued that his sentencing order must be amended to reflect that he was eligible for good-conduct credit, pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3. The court held that the written judgment order under which defendant's sentence of imprisonment was entered contained no provision regarding truth-in-sentencing. Because the truth-in-sentencing provisions were unconstitutional, the trial court's verbal ruling applying the truth-in-sentencing provisions was void, but the rest of defendant's sentence remained valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and sentence of imprisonment, but modified the portion of defendant's sentence entered under the truth-in-sentencing provisions on the grounds that the trial court's verbal ruling applying the truth-in-sentencing provisions was void.</SPAN></P>

The children had already been adjudicated neglected and made wards of the court because their environment was not clean or healthy, and one of them had unexplained bruises. Respondents argued that they had not been given 12 months to show reasonable progress in correcting the conditions requiring removal, as the applicable statute required at the time the children had been adjudicated neglected. The statute as amended after the adjudication applied, which gave nine months to show reasonable progress, because respondents had no vested right to improve. The evidence supporting the trial court's decision was clear and convincing, because subjectively reasonable efforts did not support a finding that the progress was objectively reasonable. The best interest of the children supported the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife initiated a declaratory judgment action against defendant company for death benefits, based on the death of plaintiff's husband, pursuant to the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act (Act), 820 Ill.

The court denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted defendant company's motion for summary judgment because the court found that plaintiff's claim was barred by a lump-sum settlement agreement executed by plaintiff's husband and defendant company. The appellate court held that the court did not err in finding that it had primary jurisdiction because the matter involved a question of law, defendant commission's expertise was neither helpful nor necessary, and a potential to foreclose needless litigation by a court ruling existed. After considering the lump-sum settlement agreement and the Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 310/a (1996), the appellate court held that plaintiff's claim was not barred because the provision of &sect; 9 of the Act, 820 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied defendant's motion for a new trial and entered judgment convicting defendant of aggravated sexual assault, attempted murder, violation of the Firearm Owner's Identification Card Act, 430 Ill Comp. Stat. 65/2(a)(1) (1995), and armed violence. The court imposed consecutive sentences for each conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman alleged that defendant approached her and demanded sex. She contended that when she refused defendant's demands, he shot at her and severely beat her with the butt of his gun. When officers responded to the scene of the crime, defendant fled. Plaintiff State of Illinois brought charges against defendant, alleging that he was guilty of aggravated sexual assault, attempted murder, violation of the Firearm Owner's Identification Card Act (Act), 430 Ill Comp. Stat. 65/2(a)(1) (1995), and armed violence. Following a trial of the matter, defendant was convicted as charged and the lower court imposed consecutive sentences for each of the convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The appellate court determined that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to prove that defendant was guilty of the elements of the offenses for which he was charged and that the offenses were separate offenses that could not be considered lesser included offenses. However, the appellate court determined that defendant had to be resentenced under the Act because an amendment to the statute required a misdemeanor rather than a felony classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision of the lower court convicting defendant of sexual assault, attempted murder, and related crimes and sentencing defendant to consecutive sentences was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that while defendant's convictions were supported by the evidence, defendant's sentence for his violation of the state firearm identification statute was improper, and remand was necessary for resentencing on that offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered judgment for appellee conservator in appellant's action to enforce a lien to recover expenses of treatment. Appellant's hospital lien, which was filed pursuant to the Hospital Lien Act, 770 Ill. Comp. Stat. 35/0.01 et seq. (1996), was adjudicated to zero.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee conservator's ward jumped from a hospital window, he received medical and psychological treatment from appellant Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities. When appellee obtained a settlement in a lawsuit he brought against the hospital on behalf of his ward, appellant filed a notice of lien pursuant to the Hospital Lien Act, 770 Ill. Comp. Stat. 35/0.01 et seq. The trial court adjudicated appellant's lien to zero and entered judgment for appellee in appellant's action to enforce the lien. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court did not err by requiring appellant to prove a causal connection between the ward's injuries from the fall, which resulted in the settlement, and the treatment provided by appellant. Because appellant had not differentiated between medical and psychiatric treatment in its billing, the court was unable to set a reasonable figure for the charges to which appellant might have been entitled for the medical treatment. Thus, appellant was not entitled to recover expenses through the imposition of a lien pursuant to the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners constructed and operated a private school in their garage without obtaining a variance and special use permit. Appellee county filed suit against appellants for violating zoning laws. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment. The 1996 zoning code was void because it was not passed by a simple majority, as required by 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5--12014(b) (1996). Accordingly, the 1967 zoning code was applicable. Sufficient evidence supported the trial court's determination that appellants' school constituted an illegal use of their property. The principal use of appellants' property was as a single-family dwelling. The school was not an accessory use of the property because it was not clearly and customarily incidental to a single-family dwelling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court for the 14th Judicial Circuit Rock Island County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. Defendant appealed from the lower court's application of the truth-in-sentencing law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached a car occupied by two individuals and fired at least four shots into the car. Defendant was then charged and convicted of one count of attempted murder and one count of aggravated battery with a firearm as to each victim. Application of truth-in-sentencing law required defendant to serve 85 percent of his sentence. The court vacated the aggravated battery convictions based on one-act one-crime principles. The firing of the gun in rapid succession constituted a single act as to each victim. That act could be the basis for only one conviction per victim and, therefore, the aggravated battery convictions had to be reversed. Defendant's sentence was not subject to the truth-in-sentencing provisions. Ill. Public Act 89--404, which contained the truth-in-sentencing law, was found to be unconstitutional. The defects of the truth-in-sentencing law were not cured until after defendant committed his crimes, and therefore the curative legislation was inapplicable to defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions for attempted murder, but vacated the aggravated battery convictions because they violated one-act one-crime principles. Defendant's firing of a weapon constituted a single act as to each victim and that act could be the basis for only one conviction per victim.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the victim had not suffered great bodily harm where the victim testified that she did not immediately feel pain after being shot, holding that it was for the trier of fact to determine whether the victim had suffered great bodily harm based on the nature of the injury. Because defendant only fired one shot causing injury to the victim, the court held that defendant could only be convicted of armed violence and vacated the convictions for aggravated battery with a firearm and aggravated discharge of firearm because those convictions were based on the same physical act as the conviction for armed violence. Where the statute used to sentence defendant was found to be unconstitutional, the court remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for armed violence was affirmed but her convictions for aggravated discharge of a firearm and aggravated battery with a firearm were vacated where they were based upon the same physical act as used to convict defendant of armed violence. The case was remanded for sentencing where the statute used to sentence defendant had been found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants placed billboards in areas where signage was prohibited by a city ordinance. Plaintiff city filed complaints, and defendants were found guilty of ordinance violations. Defendants argued on appeal that the ordinances were void, that plaintiff city failed to comply with statutory notice requirements, that the ordinance was invalid because it lacked an ordaining clause, and that the fines assessed were unconstitutional. The court reversed and held that the ordinance was invalidly enacted and, therefore, plaintiff city could not enforce it against defendants. The purpose of notice was to give all parties an opportunity to support or oppose a matter at issue. Notice setting forth the time and place of a hearing to zone property was mandatory and jurisdictional and any amendment passed in contravention thereof was void. The original published notice, while adequate to notify interested persons of a public hearing, did not serve to provide notice of a subsequent public hearing where no meeting of the zoning board was opened. Thus, the billboard ordinance was passed in contravention of the notice requirements of 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-13-14 and was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of guilty against defendants in an action where they had been prosecuted for placing billboards in areas where signage was prohibited by a city ordinance because the notice requirements required by statute were not met, rendering the ordinance void and unenforceable against defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two store managers and restaurant chain, were counting money in a safe, when they discovered that $ 50 was missing. Appellants accused appellees, four restaurant employees, of taking the money and forced them to submit to a strip search. The money was later discovered missing due to a bank error, and appellees brought suit against appellants for false imprisonment. Appellant moved for motion to dismiss, or in the alternative that appellees could proceed only under the Workers' Compensation Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/1 et seq. (1996). The trial court denied both motions, and a jury verdict resulted in appellees' favor, awarding compensatory and punitive damages. Appellants challenged the judgment and the court held that the worker's compensation did not apply because appellees were not injured and did not miss any time off from work. The court also stated that appellees proved the intentional tort of false imprisonment. The court affirmed the jury verdict in appellees' behalf, concluding that both the compensatory and punitive damages was reasonable and was not based upon passion or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of two orders by the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which granted the state's motion to revoke defendant's probation for domestic battery, and a second decision convicting defendant of first-degree murder. Defendant argued it was error to admit evidence of defendant's other crimes against the victim and error to sentence defendant as a Class 4 felon for his conviction of felony domestic battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed two orders of the trial court: the first granting the state's motion to revoke defendant's probation for domestic battery of a victim, and a second decision convicting defendant of first-degree murder of the same victim. The court held that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit evidence of the previous acts of abuse defendant committed against the victim because the probative value of that other crimes evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial impact. The reported incidents occurred within several months of the murder. In each of the incidents defendant committed an act of violence upon the victim or engaged in obsessive behavior. The court held that a second conviction of domestic battery was not required to enhance defendant's sentence under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12--3.2(b) (1996). Qualification for an enhancement under the statute simply required that defendant had committed a &quot;violation&quot; of the domestic battery statute. Therefore, the court held it was not error to enhance defendant's sentence based upon the three prior occasions where defendant was charged with, but not convicted of domestic battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments as modified. It was not an abuse of discretion to admit evidence of other crimes defendant committed against the victim because the probative value of that evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial value. Statutory enhancement of defendant's sentence for domestic battery was properly based upon the prior occasions where defendant was charged with but not convicted of domestic battery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners and development corporation presented a development plan to defendant village to build 10 homes on a 10-acre property. Defendant village later rezoned the property to limit the number of homes allowed on the property to five. Plaintiffs filed suit, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the zoning ordinances. Plaintiffs sought to have defendant village's re-zoning of the land declared invalid, and alleged damages for inverse condemnation and improper taking of the property. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed the finding that no party had a vested right in the continuation of a zoning ordinance. The court held that plaintiffs did not satisfy the criteria for invoking the estoppel doctrine against defendant village. The court, after reviewing the La Salle and Sinclair factors, determined that plaintiffs failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the zoning classification at issue was arbitrary and capricious. The court further held that plaintiffs did not prove that the zoning ordinance deprived them of all economically viable uses for the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which denied his motion in limine, regarding the testimony of a deceased victim of gunshot wounds, naming defendant as his assailant. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2) (1996), and aggravated battery with a firearm, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4.2(a)(1) (1996).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a motion in limine regarding the testimony of a victim of gunshot wounds. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2) (1996), and aggravated battery with a firearm, 720 Ill. Comp.

The victim could not speak, but nodded affirmatively and began to cry when shown a photograph of defendant. The trial court admitted the victim's reaction as an excited utterance and a spontaneous declaration. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion, and that the victim's nod when shown a photograph of defendant was not the type of startling event that would cause an excited utterance under the exception to the hearsay rule. The error was harmless, however, where sufficient evidence, beyond the victim's testimony, existed to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was returning from a trip to Jamaica when she was arrested for possession of cocaine. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment after being convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/401. At trial, customs officials testified that defendant was carrying bottles of wine, which also contained cocaine. Defendant testified that she had been offered the trip for free and that the only catch was that she had to carry back some wine. Defendant testified that she did not know of the cocaine and thought it was legal to transport the wine. Defendant appealed her conviction and sentence. The court affirmed, holding that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew she was carrying contraband because the circumstances of the free trip were suspicious. Where defendant failed to show that her co-defendant's testimony would have been material to her defense, so that the outcome of the case would have been different, the court held that her constitutional right to offer testimony had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the finding of delinquency because defendant's demand for a jury trial was denied, thus depriving him of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970). The court held that defendant, because he had been charged with first-degree murder, was similarly situated as a violent juvenile offender or as a habitual juvenile offender. The court further held that because 405/5-33(1.5) did not preclude a jury trial, a trial by jury must have been granted if requested. The court found no rational basis or legitimate legislative goal was served by granting the right to a jury trial for two offenses and denying it as to a third. The court ruled that under the totality of circumstances, defendant's confession was improperly obtained because defendant had no advice from an adult, he was alone with police officers when interrogated, he was not a free agent after giving an exculpatory statement, he never signed a formal waiver of his rights, and his statements never were reduced to writing and given to him to review or sign.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that defendant's confession was improperly obtained because he had no advice and counsel, he was alone with police officers during interrogation, and he was not a free agent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a mayor, appealed the order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that granted motion filed by plaintiffs, city aldermen, for summary judgment on defendant's counterclaim that sought an order declaring that the city ordinance that allowed a committee member to hire independent counsel with the approval of the council, violated Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city council passed an ordinance that granted the chairman of the finance committee (chairman), upon the request of an alderman, the exclusive right to hire an attorney, subject to the approval of the city council, and filed a complaint seeking the compliance of defendant, the mayor. Defendant filed a counterclaim seeking to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional, alleging that the ordinance unlawfully restricted his power, thus changing the form of the city's government without a referendum as required by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(f). The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim. On appeal, the court held that under 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-1-7(b), the corporate authorities had the power to hire attorneys as consultants. Because plaintiff and defendants were the corporate authorities as defined by 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-1-2(2)(c), and the chairman's right to hire an attorney was subject to the approval of the council, which was presided over by defendant pursuant to Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3.1-40-30, the ordinance did not change the form of the city's government and was not unconstitutional. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

No statute prevented such consent. The trial court was asked to examine the parents' exercise of authority to ensure that the minor's liberty interests were protected. The trial court authorized the ECT, and on motion by respondent's appointed counsel, directed the clerk to prepare and file a notice of appeal. On appeal, the court determined that although there was a lack of statutory authority concerning consent for ECT, it was proper for the lower court to adopt the framework of similar legislation to guide its analysis in order to provide constitutional safeguard to the minor to protect her rights under the common law. The court determined that review of the record indicated that the minor's right of procedural due process was met and that her parents and physicians were acting in her best interest. The order was, therefore, affirmed and the motion to withdraw was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions on two counts of burglary in the Circuit Court of DeKalb County (Illinois), contending that the trial court erred by admitting statements that defendant made to police officers regarding the burglaries during supposed plea bargain negotiations, in refusing defendant's requests for different appointed counsel, and by allowing a guilty but mentally ill jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his burglary convictions, contending that the trial court erred by admitting statements that he made to police regarding the burglaries. Defendant claimed that the statements were allegedly inadmissible as part of a plea negotiation under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402(f), 134 Ill. 2d R. 402(f). Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred by refusing requests for different appointed counsel, and by allowing a guilty but mentally ill jury instruction. Upon de novo review, the court considered Rule 402(f), which stated that if a plea discussion did not result in a guilty plea, neither the plea discussion nor any resulting agreement, plea, or judgment were admissible against defendant. The court affirmed the trial court's admission of defendant's statements, concluding that the rudiments of a negotiation process were not present where the state and police made no comments about defendant making a plea. Defendant's other contentions of error were also unsuccessful, and the convictions were affirmed. Defendant's request for 25 days credit toward his sentence was granted because the trial court erred in not giving credit for time spent in custody before posting bond.</SPAN></P>

The court held the hearsay statements of the second witness were not admissible under &sect; 115-10.2, because they lacked trustworthiness where there were substantial and numerous inconsistencies in his statements, and the statements were not subject to meaningful cross-examination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a debriefing and consideration agreement with plaintiff state but during the proceedings, defendant was charged in another case in violation of the agreement with the state. Defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss pending indictments or, in the alternative, enforce the agreement between defendant and the state that he be given boot camp or probation. The trial court dismissed the indictments and the state appealed, arguing that the agreement was not binding on the state because no agreement actually existed. The court agreed with the state, noting that only defendant had argued that he was promised boot camp or probation in return for his testimony. Neither his former attorney nor the state alleged any promise of the kind. The court further noted that defendant had not complied with his part of the agreement not to pick up another case. The court held that because defendant showed no prejudice, even if there was a plea agreement, defendant had not yet pleaded guilty and therefore could not assert the argument. The court therefore reversed the dismissal and remanded the case back to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant's blood contained evanescent evidence, which was her changing BAC. The test was performed in a hospital by medical personnel according to standard medical procedures. The officer had probable cause to stop defendant for driving while under the influence before he ordered the test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed an application with respondent commerce commission seeking authorization to build a pipeline. Respondent waived a hearing and granted petitioners' certificate of public convenience and necessity after finding that a public need existed. Due to an inability to obtain easements from all of the affected landowners, petitioners sought eminent domain power. After the time to petition for a rehearing on its grant of petitioners' certificate expired, respondent filed a report to reopen the proceeding. A decision rescinding petitioners' certificate was reversed and remanded. Petitioners, having complied with the provisions of the statute, acquired a property right to build the pipeline. Respondent had to afford procedural due process to petitioners. Petitioners were not provided the required notice. Respondent did not issue a written complaint charging any violation of its prior order granting petitioners' certificate, or any change in the law, or any factual change constituting a violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the rescission of petitioners' certificate because the procedure used by respondent violated petitioners' procedural due process rights by not giving petitioners the required notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery by the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) and appealed his life sentence, contending that the trial court failed to make a written finding as required by the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/33B-2 (1996), and that he was not given a hearing prior to being ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of his defense, as required by 725 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced as a habitual offender to life imprisonment. He filed an appeal, challenging his sentence because the trial court failed to make a written finding as required by the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/33B-2 (1996), and to comply with 725 ILCS 5/113-3.1(a) (1996), by not conducting a hearing prior to ordering him to reimburse the county for the cost of his defense. He then filed a motion to reconsider sentence and to declare the sentencing statute unconstitutional. The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the appeal in spite of defendant's filing of the posttrial motion to reconsider sentence. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It held that defendant forfeited his argument that the trial court made no written finding under the habitual offender statute, because he did not raise the issue at the hearing or in a timely motion to reconsider sentence, and no exceptions to the forfeiture rule applied. It also held that the court did not hold the hearing required before ordering defendant to reimburse the county for the services of his appointed counsel, and remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from a determination of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) that proceedings should be returned to juvenile court for disposition instead of remaining in criminal court for sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state initiated delinquency proceedings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5--4, against 15 year old defendant. The state alleged that defendant committed offenses that included attempted first degree murder and aggravated discharge of a firearm, which were predicate offenses that gave rise to a rebuttable presumption to transfer a minor's case to criminal court. The state filed a petition to transfer defendant's case to criminal court, which was granted. Defendant tendered pleas of guilty to lesser charges. The trial court accepted defendant's pleas. Defendant then filed a petition to transfer his case back to juvenile court for disposition. The state filed a motion to retain jurisdiction in criminal court. The state argued that the legislature's intent was for the decision to transfer to stand throughout the proceedings and to have the minor sentenced as an adult on all the offenses of which he was convicted, even if none of those offenses were predicate offenses. The court held that it was appropriate to make a new determination of whether a minor's case should be returned to juvenile court for disposition, or retained in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination that proceedings should be returned to juvenile court. The court held that it was appropriate for the trial court to hold a new hearing on whether criminal court jurisdiction should be retained where the juvenile offender was convicted only of offenses that would not give rise to mandatory transfer or rebuttable presumption for transfer to criminal courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his sentences for attempted first-degree murder of a peace officer, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated battery with firearm, and unlawful possession of a stolen vehicle. The court affirmed the sentence for possession, which was extended due to conviction of the more serious offenses, holding that under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-2(a) (1996), imposition of extended terms on separately charged, differing class offenses arising from unrelated courses of conduct was proper whether they were prosecuted separately or consolidated. The court held void the 160-year sentence for attempted murder as unauthorized by 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-4(c)(1). The court reduced it and remanded for amendment of the sentencing order, and held that defendant was eligible for good-time credit under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3. The court rejected defendant's claim that the statutory amendment increasing the penalty for attempted first degree murder of a peace officer in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/8-4(c)(1) was unconstitutional under the single subject rule, holding that the provisions of the act were related.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff diesel fuel purchasers appealed the dismissal of their complaints in a case for declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of a municipal ordinance that imposed a tax on diesel fuel, asserting the trial court erred in finding that they lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of the ordinance and wrongly rejected plaintiffs' uniformity clause claim. Defendants challenged the grant of class certification to plaintiffs. The court held plaintiffs did have standing where they had paid money pursuant to the tax which they alleged to be violative of the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. of 1970, art. IX, &sect; 2. The court held the ordinance was not violative of the uniformity clause where the tax classification was based on a real and substantial difference between the people taxed and those not taxed, and the classification was reasonably related to public policy. The court held the trial court erred in granting class standing where plaintiffs did not address the statutory requirements necessary to maintain a class action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county's ordinance created an amusement tax that was to be collected and remitted by owners and operators of amusement places. Appellant village, which was within the county and owned and operated amusement places, enacted an ordinance that provided appellant's patrons would not pay the tax, and appellant employees would not collect it. Appellee filed a complaint against appellant for mandamus, injunction, lack of constitutionality, and other relief. The circuit court granted appellee's motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that appellant's ordinance was not a constitutional exercise of its home rule authority. The court also found that appellant's ordinance had extraterritorial effect because it prevented the imposition of the amusement tax on ticket purchases from third parties outside the village. The issue on appeal was whether enacting the ordinance exceeded appellant's grant of home rule power under article VII, section 6(a) of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. The court held that the ordinance was not for appellant's own government and affairs, but those of the county, and therefore, affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) that denied his request for a transfer from the Department of Corrections so that he could receive additional psychiatric treatment. Defendant asserted the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act, pursuant to which he had been committed, violated his rights to due process and equal protection, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Ill. Const. of 1970 art. 1, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision that denied his application, pursuant to the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act (Act), 725 Ill. Comp Stat. 205/9 (1996), seeking a transfer from the Department of Corrections (DOC) for additional psychiatric treatment, asserting the Act violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. Because an individual could not be adjudicated sexually dangerous unless he had a mental disorder for more than one year and he demonstrated propensities towards acts of sexual assault or sexual molestation of children, the court held the legislature could prescribe a different manner of treatment for persons committed as sexually dangerous persons and those committed for other mental health issues. The court held the Act was not unconstitutional where it was rationally tailored to achieve its objective to provide treatment and to protect the public from sexual violence, and so did not violate equal protection, and where proceedings under the Act were reasonably related to the substantial public interest of protecting citizens from dangerous deviant sexual behavior, and so did not violate due process. Accordingly, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued he was deprived of the right to a trial by an impartial jury, he was denied the right to effective assistance of trial counsel, and his extended-term sentence for murder was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment that convicted him of first-degree murder and aggravated discharge of a firearm, and imposed an extended-term sentence for the murder conviction. Defendant asserted the jury was not impartial, his trial counsel was ineffective, and his extended-term sentence was an abuse of discretion. The court held defendant had not been denied his right to a trial by an impartial jury where the trial court's questions and procedures employed in voir dire to gauge juror competency created a reasonable assurance that any prejudice or bias would be discovered, and defendant failed to show that any juror was partial. The court held the counsel's decision to not use a peremptory challenge against the suspect juror did not amount to ineffective assistance where it was not objectively unreasonable, and defendant failed to show that it was not tactical and a matter of jury selection strategy. The court held the sentence imposed by the trial court was unenforceable because defendant did not satisfy the criteria required to extend his sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction was affirmed, and the sentence was reduced to the maximum for first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of home invasion, residential burglary, aggravated battery of a senior citizen, and aggravated battery. During his trial, the lower court failed to respond to two notes sent by the jury indicating that they were deadlocked because the notes were sent when the court and counsel were at dinner. On appeal, defendant contended that the failure to respond had the effect of coercing the deadlocked jury into reaching a compromise verdict, and that his constitutional right to be present at every critical stage was violated. The court rejected this argument, finding that the lower court's failure to respond to the jury notes did not coerce the jury to reach a unanimous verdict. The court noted that the length of deliberations were not excessive given the fact that defendant was charged with eight counts. The court also found that defendant was not denied the right to be present at a critical stage in the trial. Defendant's convictions were affirmed except for his conviction for aggravated battery, which was vacated, because it was a lesser-included offense of aggravated battery of a senior citizen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's jury convictions for home invasion, residential burglary and aggravated battery of a senior citizen were not coerced because the court failed to respond to notes from the jury, and were, therefore, affirmed, but his sentence on those counts was modified to allow for application of the good conduct credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electric cooperative appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Moultrie County (Illinois), which dismissed plaintiff's action to enjoin defendant city from providing electrical service to disputed areas outside defendant's corporate limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order dismissing plaintiff electric cooperative's suit seeking to enjoin defendant city from providing electrical service to disputed areas outside defendant's corporate limits. Plaintiff filed suit when defendant planned to provide electric service to areas outside its corporate limits without annexing them. Plaintiff's suit was dismissed and the court ruled that the agreement was clear and unambiguous that existing service territories did not have to be annexed before defendant could serve them. The court also held that under Illinois Municipal Code, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-117-1(2) (5/11-117-1) (1996), defendant could sell electric power to areas outside its corporate limits because the agreement was a waiver by plaintiff that relinquished its rights with respect to the disputed territories. Further, the court found that the agreement was not void for lack of approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission, because it did not come within the Electric Supplier Act (Act), 220 Ill. Comp. Stat. 30/1-16 (1996). The agreement was not a &quot;service area&quot; agreement, and defendant was not an electric supplier, electric cooperative, or a public utility under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The jury found defendant not guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 18 years' imprisonment for armed violence and 10 years' imprisonment for unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. No sentence was imposed for the unlawful use of a weapon. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction of armed violence, reversed the conviction of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon, and vacated the sentences, holding that the sentence for unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon violated the one-act, one-crime rule where the armed violence conviction was based on the same act, and Public Act 88-680, the statute increasing the minimum sentence for armed violence violated the single subject rule of Ill.

Respondent informed the court he wanted to proceed without representation. The court refused the request. After voir dire, respondent made statements in court about not wanting representation.

Respondent was ordered hospitalized pursuant to the Mental Health Code, 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-100 et seq. Respondent sought review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, appellant was declared to be a sexually dangerous person pursuant to the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act (Act), 725 Ill.

Appellant sought review, presenting three issues on appeal: (1) whether the trial court erred when it refused to appoint an independent psychiatrist for him; (2) whether he was denied due process; and (3) whether he was denied equal protection of the laws. The court affirmed, holding that no statutory authority or case law existed to support defendant's request for an independent psychiatrist. The court reviewed appellant's constitutional claim under the plain error doctrine, because the constitutionality of the Act had never been called into question, and held that the statute did not deprive appellant of his due process or equal protection rights.

Defendant appealed and argued that the cause must be remanded because her attorney failed to comply with a court rule. The rule required an attorney appointed in a postconviction proceeding to consult with defendant to ascertain her contentions of deprivations of constitutional rights, to examine the report of proceedings at trial, and, if necessary, to amend the petition to present adequately the defendant's contentions. The court held that a postconviction proceeding had three stages. The court held that the trial court's order revealed that it considered defendant's petition under the first stage of the proceedings. The dismissal order entered by the trial court mirrored the language to be employed during a first stage dismissal. The court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the Circuit Court of Douglas County (Illinois) of violating an order of protection under the Criminal Code of 1961, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-30 (1996), the order of protection having been entered pursuant to the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/101 et seq. (1994).</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/12-30 (1996), and appealed, contending that the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 (Act), 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/101 et seq. (1994), was vague and overbroad and, therefore, violative of U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV, and Ill. Const. 1970 art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, that the state failed to prove him guilty, that the trial court erred in excluding certain evidence, and that the prosecutor's closing argument violated due process. In affirming, the court held that the Act's definition of harassment included knowing conduct not necessary to accomplish a reasonable purpose, and defendant should have known his conduct was not reasonable; hence, the Act was not vague. The court also held that the Act was not overbroad, and the element of expression in the definition of harassment was not constitutionally protected. The court found defendant's additional assignments of error to be without merit as the evidence was sufficient to convict him, the excluded evidence was irrelevant, and defendant failed to preserve the violation of due process issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of violating an order of protection, holding that defendant should have been aware that his conduct was not reasonable, his speech was not constitutionally protected, the evidence was sufficient to convict him, any evidence excluded by the trial court was irrelevant, and defendant failed to preserve the issue of violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs engaged in building residential homes. Plaintiffs alleged defendant municipality adopted by ordinance a schedule of impact fees required to be paid as a condition of obtaining a building permit for a residential unit.

The trial court found that plaintiffs had pled a tort type action and that the action was time-barred under the one-year statute of limitations for civil actions filed against a local public entity. Plaintiffs contended that the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp.

Defendant responded that the Act extended to any civil action brought against a local public entity. 735 Ill. Comp.

No hearing was held on that motion and the record did not reveal any disposition by the trial court. The unresolved motion postdated the notice of appeal. Appellant argued that the sentence was improper because the trial court failed to make a written finding as required by the habitual offender statute. Second, he argued that the trial court failed to comply with criminal procedure code in that he was not given a hearing prior to being ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of his defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to dismiss was denied, defendant was convicted of the unlawful failure to register as a sex offender. He appealed arguing that the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/1 et seq. (Supp. 1997), and the Sex Offender and Child Murderer Community Notification Law, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 152/101 et seq. (Supp. 1997) were unconstitutional in that they violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The court rejected his argument concluding that the legislature did not intend to impose punishment with the enactment of the statutes, and that the statutes did not have a punitive effect. The court found that the purpose of the statutes was to protect the public. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was deprived of his right to due process because the statutes did not provide for a hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant's attorney failed to object to the admission of a co-defendant's statements. Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery with a firearm under a theory of accountability for the actions of a co-defendant. Defendant sought review and argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI. The appellate court found that the elicitation of the co-defendant's statement constituted reasonable trial strategy in an effort to distance defendant from both the shootings. Similarly, counsel's failure to object to the co-defendant's statements included within defendant's custodial statement constituted a strategic choice. The appellate court modified defendant's sentence because the legislation that enacted the truth-in-sentencing provision was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, as modified, because defendant failed to establish that his trial counsel's actions fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and as such, he was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of aggravated battery of a child and was sentenced to a term of 30 years in prison. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion because he based his decision on the evidence, the aggravating and mitigating factors presented, and the presentence investigation report in sentencing defendant to the maximum sentence possible. The court found that the truth-in-sentencing provision that was enacted in Pub. Act 89-404 was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule of the Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d), but that the subsequent amendment by 1996 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner partner of decedent sought a surviving spouse's share of decedent's estate in probate court after decedent died intestate. Respondent administrator of the estate filed a motion to dismiss the claim asserting that petitioner could not be a surviving spouse because Illinois did not recognize same-sex marriages. The trial court granted the motion. Upon review, petitioner argued that the prohibition against same-sex marriages violated the equal protection provisions of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The court held that the issue was nonjusticiable and moot because it did not affect the actual controversy between the parties. In making the determination, the court held that it had to decide whether actual spousal status could be conferred upon petitioner and whether the relationship between decedent and petitioner could be construed as a valid marriage. The court held that the facts alleged did not meet the statutory requirements for a valid marriage and spousal status could not be conferred. Further, adjudicating petitioner's constitutional challenge would result in the same nonmarital status. The decision of the probate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff ticket brokers appealed from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant holding that an amended amusement tax ordinance, Chicago, Ill., Mun.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ticket brokers contended that Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 4-156-020(F) (amended November 15, 1995), an amendment to the tax ordinance, was an unconstitutional service or occupation tax by the city. The amended amusement tax ordinance was not an unconstitutional service or occupation tax violating Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e). The main substance of the transactions between ticket brokers and their patrons was the purchase of a ticket as tangible property and any other services rendered were incidental. The tickets were tangible personal property, and therefore, the city's amended amusement tax ordinance did not constitute an occupational or service tax. The amusement taxes were within the category of items within home rule powers. The amended amusement tax was authorized by 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-42-1. The brokers did not provide an adequate record to review whether the city's amended amusement tax was an unconstitutional extraterritorial exercise of its home rule authority when applied to ticket brokers located outside the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment was affirmed but was reversed and remanded for the purpose of resolving the material issue of whether the ordinance was being extraterritorially applied to the ticket brokers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An arson and explosives investigator was called to the scene of a metal railroad trestle bridge after a total of 21 red and blue plastic containers were found hanging from both sides. An advertisement for a fur store was painted on the sides of the bridge. The containers were plastic peanut butter jars. Each jar contained gasoline and a separate green hobby fuse inserted into the top with a metal plate underneath. Several of the fuses had been lit but had not ignited. Only one of the fuses had ignited and that device had not exploded but had only burned. Based on fingerprints on the jars, defendant was arrested. She testified that she had intended to illuminate the banners with the lit jars, which she called &quot;lanterns,&quot; in order to protest the sale of furs. The investigator testified that he would classify the jars as incendiary devices, but they could be classified as explosives if they had the proper fuel-to-air ratios. Defendant was convicted. After judgment was entered, the appellate court found that the State had not shown under the applicable statute that the devices were &quot;explosive&quot; devices designed to detonate, and thus, the conviction was improper.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant told police investigating defendant that he had been at defendant's apartment, that defendant sold cannabis to another individual, and that defendant offered to sell cocaine to the confidential informant. Based on this information, the police permitted the confidential informant to take part in a controlled purchase of drugs from the defendant. After the purchase was made, the police obtained a &quot;no-knock&quot; search warrant. The warrant was supported by a complaint that stated defendant had been involved in sales for at least ten days. Defendant left and drove off; he was subsequently arrested. Police then executed the warrant after they obtained a master key to defendant's residence. Defendant moved to suppress the money and cocaine that was found. After the trial court denied the motion and defendant was convicted, the appellate court found the &quot;no-knock&quot; search did not violated defendant's constitutional rights because defendant was absent when the search warrant was executed, no property was damaged in executing the warrant, and defendant had been involved in a continuing course of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

The father was unsuccessful in obtaining a court order requiring the mother to use both last names. On appeal, the appellate court held: (1) the circuit court did not err by dismissing the father's petition to require the mother to use both of their last names as their child's last name; (2) the father failed to show that the exclusion of two witnesses was reversible error; (3) the circuit court did not err in entering a directed finding that the parties did not enter an agreement that the child's last name would include both of the parties's last names; (4) the circuit court did not err in denying the father's petition to change the child's last name; and (5) the father failed to fulfill his burden of proof that an equal protection violation had occurred.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 200/21-310 (1996). The corporation also sought reimbursement with interest. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, granted the petition, but declined to award interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation bought the lien of the 1994 delinquent real estate taxes against a parcel of real estate at the annual Cook County tax sale, but it later sought to have the sale declared an error because the property was owned by a university and was not subject to taxation. Although the circuit court declared the sale in error, it refused to award the corporation interest because the failure to perform either a physical inspection of the property or a title inspection on the property would not be excused where it could be shown that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the grounds on which the sale in error was declared to be erroneous. The appellate court held that the circuit court erred in defining the term &quot;actual knowledge&quot; as used in &sect; 21-315(b)(iv) of the Property Tax Code, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/21-315(b)(iv) (1996), so broadly as to contemplate the existence of &quot;actual knowledge&quot; based solely upon the ability to obtain such knowledge.

Comp. Stat. 105/3-55 (1992) so as to exempt the bus service from tax imposed under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bus service that operated in-state school buses purchased 25 buses in order to supplement its income with charger trips for private groups, some of which required trips to other states. The bus service paid no use tax on the new buses, claiming they was exempted under &sect; 3-55 of the Act, which excluded tax on &quot;rolling stock&quot; moving in interstate commerce. The department audited the bus service and on discovering less than 5 percent of its travelled miles involved interstate travel, denied the exemption and assessed back taxes and penalties. The lower court affirmed the department, and on appeal the court affirmed, holding that the department's interpretation of the Act was entitled to substantial deference, and that the department's requirement of regular and frequent use in interstate commerce for the exemption was reasonable. This did not create an unconstitutional classification by distinguishing rolling stock used regularly in interstate commerce from that used only irregularly, as the purpose of the statute was to avoid multistate taxation, which was reasonably served by the distinction. Moreover, denial of the exemption was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the insured was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and the insurer rescinded the policy based on its discovery that the insured had been treated for diabetes. The insured brought an action against the insurer, claiming that the insurer had breached the contract, had violated 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/155 (1996), had engaged in fraud, and had violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/1 et seq. The trial court dismissed her fraud and consumer fraud actions for failure to state a claim, and granted summary judgment to the insurer on her other claims. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the fraud counts but reversed the summary judgment, holding that a fact question remained as to whether the agent acted as the insurer's agent, and thus whether his knowledge of the misrepresentation was to be imputed to the insurer.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/12-14(b)(1) (1994) and one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-16(c)(1)(i) (1994). Defendant was sentenced to 72 years in prison.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple sex crimes allegedly committed against his stepdaughter and son by him and his wife. The two children, a 10-year old girl and an 8-year old boy, were placed with a foster mother. They told her about the numerous acts of sexual abuse committed upon them by defendant and their mother. The trial court conducted a hearing to determine the admissibility of these hearsay statements. The trial court admitted into evidence most of the statements; however, it denied later statements the children made on the grounds that those statements were unreliable. Both children testified and were available to be cross-examined. Defendant was convicted on multiple criminal counts and sentenced to 72 years in prison. After judgments of conviction and sentence were entered, the appellate court found admission of the hearsay statements was not plain error, as the evidence was not closely balanced and the children had been available for cross examination. It also found the sentence was not disproportionate to the crime, but did find that the sentence on one count violated the Illinois constitution by denying him day-to-day good conduct credit.</SPAN></P>

The victim arrived first, and when the brother entered the apartment, he saw respondents preparing to throw his little brother out of the window. The brother grabbed the victim's arms and managed to pull him back inside the apartment. Both juveniles then attempted to throw the victim out the window and the brother grabbed the victim's arm. One of the juveniles bit the brother's hand, causing him to release his hold on the victim's arm. The brother then ran down the 14 flights of stairs to attempt to reach the ground before the victim landed. Counsel for both juveniles raised several issues on appeal. The court gave lengthy discussion of the issues and affirmed the trial court's decisions. The court found no errors committed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) where the legislature grants a right that neither existed at common law nor was granted by the constitution, it was free to define the parameters of its purely statutory creature; (2) the legislature was entitled to remedy abuses of a statutory cause of action by enacting procedural rules more specific than those general remedies set forth in the supreme court rules; (3) the legislature had the authority to devise procedures to be followed in causes of action it creates, such as dissolution of marriage, and the power to amend such legislation; and (4) the challenged amendments did not involve the contracts clause because they did not impair the obligations of any existing contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the student argued that &sect; 6-206(a)(10), which authorized the suspension of driving privileges where a person used false identification, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Applying a rational-basis test, it held that the statute did not violate the student's due process rights. The Code's primary purpose was the safe and legal operation of motor vehicles and it evidenced an intent to prevent drunken driving and driving by persons under 21 years old who had consumed alcohol. These were legitimate governmental goals. The statutory declaration that suspension of driving privileges was a legitimate means of removing dangerous drivers from the highway was not irrational. Further, the legislature could rationally speculate that license holders under 21 years old could use false identification in an attempt to gain access to alcohol and that such conduct would lead to an increase in drunken driving or driving by persons under 21 years old who had consumed alcohol. Thus, the legislature could rationally seek to deter these offenses by providing for the suspension of the driving privileges of a license holder who used false identification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) which granted summary judgment in favor of the Illinois Department of Revenue. The company had sought to recover taxes paid under protest as a result of the Service Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.101 et seq. (1987). The company asserted the tax violated the commerce clause and thus was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax applied to persons engaged in the business of making sales of service. Although it was a tax on the service occupation, the tax was calculated at a percentage rate of the cost of tangible personal property transferred as an incident to the sale of service. The company was located in Illinois and provided the service of making trade show exhibits which it transported to trade shows by common carrier. It also assembled, maintained, and disassembled the exhibits at the trade shows. In the transactions at issue, the exhibits were sold to Illinois customers and initially delivered to the customers at trade shows outside Illinois for use at those locations. Following disassembly of the exhibits at the end of the trade shows, the exhibits were returned to Illinois for storage and reuse. The company denied that it was liable for any tax under the act and contended the exemptions were legitimate because the exhibits were delivered and first used out of state, notwithstanding the subsequent storage in Illinois. The appellate court held the statute did not impose multiple taxation and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(1) (1994), and which sentenced him to a term of 40 years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a 17-year-old gang member who drove a fellow gang member to murder a competing gang member. Defendant testified that he joined the gang because he feared for his own life and for the life of his mother. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in striking his affirmative defense of compulsion. He wanted to introduce evidence to show that he had been compelled to participate in the murder because of the circumstances of his life. On motion of the state, the defense of compulsion was stricken. The court held that the defense of compulsion was unavailable in any murder prosecution. The fact that defendant was not eligible for the death penalty, due to his juvenile status, did not enable him to assert the compulsion defense. Defendant next contended that the truth-in-sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3 (1994), was enacted in violation of the &quot;single subject rule&quot; in the Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d). The court held that the constitutionality of the truth-in-sentencing law was not properly raised on direct review of a judgment of conviction but must instead be raised by way of an action for habeas corpus, mandamus, or declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for murder. The court found that the trial court did not commit error when it struck the affirmative defense of compulsion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pled guilty to aggravated criminal sexual assault. The defendant subsequently filed a post-conviction petition for a modification of his sentence on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in making his guilty plea. The 12th Judicial Circuit Court, Will County (Illinois) dismissed the petition as frivolous and patently without merit. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant contended that his sentence had to be modified because it was imposed pursuant to the truth-in-sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3--6--3 (1995), and that statute was unconstitutional. The State argued that the defendant waived the issue on appeal because he failed to raise it in any prior proceeding. In reply, the defendant argued that a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute was not subject to waiver. The appellate court rejected the defendant's arguments. The court found that the defendant did not argue that the truth-in-sentencing law was unconstitutional in his post-conviction petition, only that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, he waived the issue. Additionally, the truth-in-sentencing statute was collateral to the statutes under which the defendant was convicted and sentenced. Accordingly, an attack on the constitutionality of the truth-in-sentencing law was subject to waiver.</SPAN></P>

In that decision, the board sustained a ruling by its Executive Director (Director) that denied the alliance's request for voluntary recognition certification of a proposed &quot;bargaining unit&quot; under the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (Act) 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 315/1 et seq., (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 315/1 et seq. (1996) among other things, gave state employees the right to voluntarily join a union and to bargain collectively with their employer over issues concerning wages, hours of work, and other terms of employment. In order to be covered under the act, a union's bargaining unit must be certified by the labor relations board. The appellate court held that the act was inapplicable to the city that employed the police officers, as the city employed less than 35 employees. Having held that the act was inapplicable to the city, the only other issue presented in the case at bar was whether the act was unconstitutional.  5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 315/20(b) (1996) must be analyzed under the rational basis test. Under that test, the statute need only have a rational basis for distinguishing the class to which the law applied from the class to which the law did not apply. If any set of facts reasonably could have justified the classification, it should have been upheld. The court found that the act did not violate the equal protection clause and was therefore not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the father moved from his residence with the grandmother, and she brought a petition for visitation.

Because the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois), found that defendant had inflicted great bodily harm on a victim, defendant was required under &quot;truth-in-sentencing&quot; legislation,&nbsp;730 Ill.

The court also held that defense counsel was not ineffective in failing to seek a severance, and that although defense counsel should have objected to the prosecutor's request that defendant comment on the veracity of certain witnesses, defendant was not substantially prejudiced by the error. Additionally, defense counsel was not incompetent for failing to object to evidence properly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, on behalf of her child, filed a cause of action against defendant alleged father to establish the paternity of and support for the mother's child. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered an order finding the alleged father to be the natural father of the child. The trial court also entered orders of support and withholding. The alleged father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The blood tests the trial court ordered the mother, child, and alleged father to undergo resulted in a combined paternity index (CPI) of 2,582 to 1. The mother testified that in July, August, and September 1986, she engaged in sexual intercourse with the alleged father and no one else. The child was born in May 1987. The alleged father denied ever having sexual relations with the mother. The alleged father's expert witness testified that the CPI was not significant in this case. On appeal, the alleged father argued that 75 Ill. Comp. Stat. 11(f)(4) (1994) of the Illinois Parentage Act of 1984 was unconstitutional because it declared a CPI of 500 to 1 to be significant regardless of the laboratory protocol used by the testing facility. The court held that (1) the alleged father waived his constitutional challenge where he raised it for the first time on appeal, (2) the alleged father failed to promptly inform the attorney general under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 19, 134 Ill. 2d R. 19 concerning his constitutional challenge, and (3) that the alleged father had not presented sufficient evidence to rebut the statutory presumption of paternity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order finding the alleged father to be the natural father of the child. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not ordering the mother to produce the examining physician, the physician who performed the blood tests. The court held the trial court did not need the testimony of the examining physician where the CPI of 2,582 to 1 was greater than the 500 to 1 statutory CPI.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of armed violence. The trial court sentenced defendant to 16 years' imprisonment on each count. Defendant's sentences were to run concurrently. On appeal, defendant contended that his sentence for armed violence violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 because the penalty for armed violence was disproportionate to the penalty for the predicate offense of aggravated battery. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) the authority defendant relied on was unpersuasive in support of his argument that aggravated battery with a firearm was a more serious offense than aggravated battery based on great bodily harm, there was no reason to interfere with the sentencing procedures developed by legislature in relation to the offenses at issue in the case; (2) defendant's constitutional rights had not been violated and his convictions for armed violence and aggravated robbery were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment entered in the Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County (Illinois), which convicted and sentenced him for aggravated battery of a police officer and charged by traffic citations with illegal sound amplification, reckless driving and disobeying a police officer. Defendant was sentenced to five years incarceration for aggravated battery and assessed court costs on all other convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant because of the excessive volume emitting from his car radio. Refusing to comply with the officer's request for his license and insurance card, defendant sped off while the officer's arm was caught in the car window in an attempt to unlock the door. The officer hung on to the car as the defendant reached speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour. On appeal, defendant contended that 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-611 was unconstitutional because it was content-based and was overbroad in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I. While the court agreed that the state had a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise on city streets, it failed to provide a compelling reason for discriminating between the amplification of commercial speech and non-commercial speech. Statements regarding the victim's occupation were made within the judge's discussion of the factual circumstances of the crime, and the record did not support defendant's contention that the judge improperly relied on the victim's occupation to enhanced the sentence, especially since the mid-range sentence of five years was well within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

A disciplinary complaint sought disciplinary action for charging too much for his services in violation of the Act. Department suspended his license and the circuit court affirmed. Doctor appealed, arguing that &sect; 22(A)(25) was unconstitutionally vague; &sect; 22(A)(25) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority; because the Department had failed to promulgate rules defining certain phrases as set forth in &sect; 22(A)(25), it could not enforce that section against him; and the Department's decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found the terms in &sect; 22(A)(25) were capable of sufficiently precise interpretation to serve as a guide to those who had to comply with that section. Doctor's noncompliance with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 341(e)(7) resulted in his forfeiting the argument that &sect; 22(A)(25) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. Further, there was proper delegation of legislative authority and the statute sufficiently outlined requirements.

When the claim was not resolved, plaintiff filed an action for breach of contract. The circuit court granted defendant's motion to compel arbitration. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court denied plaintiff's motion to stay the appeal pending a decision on the constitutionality of &sect; 143a in light of differences in the statutory provisions of the relevant version of &sect; 143a. The court held that arbitration of claims under &sect; 143a differed from contractual arbitration because it was compulsory and the statute did not merely provide for optional arbitration. The court found that when plaintiff filed his claim for uninsured benefits he voluntarily subjected himself to the mandates of &sect; 143a, which required arbitration of the claim as to liability and damages. The court held that the mandatory arbitration under &sect; 143a could not be waived and that defendant's conduct in not proceeding to arbitration did not amount to waiver or estoppel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant sought review after the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the tenant's claim for illegal eviction against defendants, sheriff's deputies and bank. The trial court dismissed the tenant's civil rights claim against the sheriff based on sovereign immunity and dismissed the state law negligence claim for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant claimed that the eviction was unlawful because she had not received notice of the foreclosure proceedings or the sale of the premises. The tenant alleged that the sheriff was liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for maintaining a policy or procedure that allowed persons not named in a court order for possession to be summarily evicted and that the sheriff was statutorily liable for the negligence of his deputies under 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6016. The court held that (1) a sheriff's nondiscretionary, statutory duty to execute Writs of Assistance and other state court orders militated heavily in favor of recognizing that a sheriff acted as a state official in such a capacity; (2) the deputies were carrying out orders; (3) the sheriff had not had any part of the decision to evict; (4) the behaviour of the deputies was not illegal; (5) the sheriff could not be sued in his individual capacity because he was not individually involved in the eviction; and (6) the tenant had to bring an action against the state in the Court of Claims.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the denial of defendant's petition, holding that (1) the defendant did not forfeit his challenge to the extended-term sentence and he properly raised the issue in the post-conviction proceeding; (2) the trial court erred in using a prior felony conviction as both an element of an offense and a justification to impose an extended term; (3) one year of defendant's sentence was void as greater than that permitted by statute; (4) the extended-term sentence could only have been imposed on the most serious class of offenses of which the defendant was convicted; and (5) defendant's prior juvenile adjudication of delinquency could not be used to justify an extended term.

Defendants, governor and state board of elections, claimed that the statute did not infringe upon the right to vote. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the legislation did not infringe upon the right to vote but only affected the manner in which citizens exercised their right to vote. The court ruled that the Act was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The court held that the Act needed no supermajority for its passage in the legislature and that the governor's signature was timely. The court relied on the enrolled bill doctrine and rejected plaintiffs' argument that the legislature did not follow its own rules. The court held that the Act did not violate the State Mandates Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant city and against plaintiff builders in their action for a declaratory judgment that the city's ordinances, St. Charles, Ill. Municipal Code &sect; 13.08.150 (1990) and &sect; 13.08.135 (1992), which mandated electric service connection fees, were unconstitutional and invalid. The builders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city operated its own electric utility system and through its ordinances, charged new customers fees for connecting the electric service. A group of builders contended that the fees were unconstitutional and invalid because 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect;&sect; 11-119-1 and 11-119-3 prohibited the city from charging connection fees to their electric utility systems. The city argued that the builders did not have standing to challenge the ordinances because they sold the homes they built and passed the costs of connection on to the homeowners. The court held that (1) the builders had standing to challenge the constitutionality and validity of the ordinances because the city failed to establish that the builders recouped the connection fees, (2) the city had the authority to enact the ordinances because the legislature granted the power to the city to own and operate an electric service and charge reasonable fees for its operation and maintenance, (3) &sect;&sect; 11-119-1 and 11-119-3 did not prohibit the city from charging the fees because the issuance of bonds was not the only way to raise money to pay for improvements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the builders' complaint as it related to the old ordinance, but affirmed the dismissal of the counts that related to the new ordinance. The case was remanded for a disposition on the merits of the builders' challenge to the old ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court affirmed appellant police board's decision to discharge appellant police officer. The court affirmed that order on appeal. The court found that an applicable version of 735 Ill. Comp.

The court also held that appellant was in the best position to judge the credibility of each parties' experts and that its ruling in that regard was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court further determined that appellant failed to cite to any relevant authority that held that the inadvertent loss of his urine samples amounted to an unconstitutional denial of due process and that there was no evidence that the specimens were intentionally destroyed or tampered with. The court also concluded that not obtaining a warrant before requiring appellant to take a drug test because his status as a police officer placed him into a &quot;special needs&quot; exception and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-1-18.1 (1991) did not require notice before conducting the test because precedent held that it was not an examination under that statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a minor, was found following a bench trial to be delinquent based upon the charge of criminal trespass to a vehicle. The trial court sentenced defendant to one year probation and 100 hours of community service. It also ordered that as part of his probation that the defendant remove tattoos on his arms which symbolized an alliance to a street gang. Defendant appealed the order arguing that the trial court abused its discretion and that it was an intrusive and illegal condition of probation not prescribed by the Act. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment from the trial court. The court held that while the trial court is afforded a great deal of discretion in issuing conditions of probation, ordering tattoo removal was not a reasonable measure of rehabilitation for defendant and was therefore an abuse of that discretion. The court held that forcing defendant to remove his tattoos may actually hamper the intended rehabilitative goal of the court because it may be considered a humiliating, not to mention painful, procedure for the young defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that the trial court had the discretion to determine that appellant's posttrial and post-sentencing allegations, made for the purpose of obtaining new counsel, were frivolous and were intended to delay the effective administrative of justice. The court also found that, because the matters complained of clearly lacked merit or simply involved questions of trial strategy, the trial judge did not err in failing to appoint new counsel to represent appellant. The court determined that the trial court was also not in error when it refused to grant appellant a second fitness hearing because appellant had failed to establish that he was entitled to such a hearing.</SPAN></P>

In addition, he argued that the court's rejection of his insanity defense was against the manifest weight of the evidence, that his conviction should have been reversed, and that a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity should have been entered. The court determined that defendant was entitled to a hearing on his fitness because he was receiving psychotropic drugs pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/104-21(a). Accordingly, the court determined that the trial court should have conducted a retrospective hearing on the issue of whether defendant was fit to stand trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trustee and defendant city sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which declined to enjoin the city from imposing a covenant on future subdivisions or resubdivisions of property and any other property owned or hereafter acquired by any of the trustees or their heirs, beneficiaries, administrators, executors, and successors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee drew up a resubdivision of property in which two lots with single-family residences would remain essentially the same, and a third lot would be resubdivided into eight new lots. After the city's planning and development staff reviewed these documents, it was recommended that the final approval of the resubdivision of the property be subject to a condition that the trustee be required to place a covenant on the third lot that would prohibit the further subdivision. The trustee refused and the city council approved the final plat of resubdivision. The trial court granted the trustee's motions for summary judgment and held that the issue of the covenant on further resubdivision of the third lot was moot. On remand, the trial court held that the covenant against further resubdivision of third lot was not moot and enjoined the city from ever imposing the covenant. The court dismissed the appeal. At the time that the trial court ruled on the motion for summary judgment, the final plat of resubdivision had been approved without a covenant not to resubdivide. Without the imposition of such a covenant, there was no longer a controversy before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which dismissed the indictment against defendant for possession of cocaine in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/402(c) (1994) on the grounds that the state could only prove that she had cocaine in her system so any conviction would have unconstitutionally punished her for being a drug user rather than for a wrongful act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of possession of cocaine in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/402(c) (1994). The state admitted that it could only prove that defendant had cocaine in her system. The trial court held the statute unconstitutional as applied because it would have cruelly and unusually punished defendant for being a drug user rather than for committing a wrongful act, and dismissed the indictment. The state appealed, contending that the dismissal was unauthorized by the statute and amounted to an improper pretrial adjudication of the sufficiency of the evidence. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the trial court exceeded its authority in dismissing the indictment because the refusal to dismiss would not have effected a deprivation of due process or resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Due process required only that there be some evidence against defendant, it did not require the dismissal of a charge that could not be proved. The court noted that defendant did not lack recourse against a poorly founded prosecution: she could demand speedy trial under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/103--5 (1996).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union's petitions sought to have the union declared the collective bargaining representative for assistant principals employed by respondent board of education (board).

Comp. Stat. 5/2(b) (1996) excluded managerial employees from the definition of &quot;educational employees,&quot; and assistant principals were managerial employees as defined by &sect; 2(o) of the act, 115 Ill.

Assistant principals were responsible for directing the board's policies and practices and their professional interests could not be separated from those of their principals.

The Circuit Court for the 10th Judicial Circuit Putnam County (Illinois), issued an opinion which permitted execution of the nonwage garnishment. The judgment-debtor appealed contending that an agreed order executed by the collection agency constituted an accord and satisfaction of the entire judgment and precluded the garnishment of his accounts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collection agency sued the judgment-debtor and his wife to collect various outstanding medical bills incurred during their marriage. When the couple divorced the wife agreed she would assume responsibility for paying the bills. The collection agency obtained a judgment against the judgment-debtor by default and began non-wage garnishment proceedings against him. The judgment-debtor filed objections and a motion to quash contending that the collection agency's agreement with his ex-wife was an accord and satisfaction and the non-wage garnishment statute was unconstitutional because it failed to provide him with pre-seizure notice. The trial court found for the collection agency. On appeal, the court held that (1) where neither the judgment debtor nor his wife disputed the amount of the debt and the claim was certain and evidence of consideration and mutual intent to compromise was lacking, the facts did not support an accord and satisfaction, (2) there was no executory accord or compromise of the claim, and (3) it was not a violation of the judgment-debtor's due process rights to provide him with an opportunity to defend against the garnishment after his assets had been seized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on various criminal charges after the police executed a no-knock warrant pursuant to 725 Ill.

The court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to quash. The no-knock warrant was issued based on existent circumstances, which were defined by &sect; 5/108-8(b)(4) as wooden planking or other impediments to entry into the premises. Although &sect; 5/108-8(b)(4) did not violate the federal constitution, it did violate Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6's reasonableness requirement. Exigent circumstances did not exist based solely on the fortification of a dwelling with a barricade blocking the doors. Rather, evidence of an intent to prevent police access, to destroy evidence, or that a knock and announce would have been futile was required. The exclusionary rule of Ill. Const. art. I &sect; 6 protected defendant from a search warrant executed pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Good faith did not excuse the unreasonable search. Thus, the denial of defendant's motion to quash the warrant was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff expert appealed the decision entered in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which affirmed the order of defendant, Department of Professional Regulation (Illinois) directing the expert to cease and desist the unlicensed practice of professional engineering in violation of 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 325/39 and 40. The expert contended that the order was void and should be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department solicited a brochure from the expert, which advertised his services as an expert witness. The department's found that the expert was not licensed to practice as a professional engineer in the state, as indicated in his resume and a letter he sent to the department. The court concluded that the findings were adequate. The expert's cover letter and resume cited his experience in engineering, and he clearly held himself out as able to perform many services recognized as professional engineering practices, especially forensic engineering. The state had a legitimate interest in regulating the practice of professional engineering, which had been determined to affect public health, safety, and welfare, and the order issued pursuant to the Professional Engineering Practice Act of 1989, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 325/39 was in proportion to the state's interest. Anyone reading the expert's literature would be misled to believe that he was a licensed professional engineer. Therefore, the order was not an unconstitutional prohibition of protected speech, and was not vague in its prohibition of the use of the title engineer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in favor of the department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated child battery. He contended that because the trial court failed to rule upon his original post-conviction petition within 90 days of its filing, the trial court lacked authority to dismiss the petition under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-2.1 of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to aggravated battery of a child, defendant was sentenced to 25 years in prison as a Class X offender pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (1992) of the Unified Code of Corrections. In an earlier action, his appeal was affirmed. Defendant filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (1996), but amended the petition a month later, asserting that he had been subjected to double sentence enhancement, and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court dismissed the petition as frivolous, and defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court lacked authority to dismiss by failing to timely rule. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that, in order to give the trial court the full time the legislature deemed necessary for the trial court to consider the petitions under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-2.1, defendant's filing of the amended petition started the 90-day period review period anew, not only for the later-filed petition, but for the earlier petition, as well. The court examined defendant's claims and agreed that they were frivolous.</SPAN></P>

He argued that his statutory right to a speedy trial, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/103-5 (1996), on the aggravated criminal sexual assault charge was violated; that his sentence was void because Ill. Public Act 89-404 (Act) was unconstitutional; and that his sentences of 12 years were excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with home invasion after he forced his way into his ex-wife's home and sexually assaulted her. His motion for a continuance to seek funds to hire an expert witness was granted. The state filed an amended information, adding charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant's motion to dismiss the added counts was denied. He was convicted of home invasion and aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to 12 years. Affirming the conviction and sentences, the court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated. The sexual assault offense, known to the state at the time of the original prosecution and arising from the same set of facts, was subject to the speedy-trial limits that applied to the home invasion charge. However, the continuance was attributable to defendant and could not be used to justify dismissal of the sexual assault charge on the basis that 120 days had elapsed since he was arrested. The court ruled that defendant could not challenge in a direct appeal the constitutionality of the Act codifying the truth-in-sentencing laws because the application of those laws was outside the scope of the sentencing proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The arbitration provisions provided that if the award exceeded the minimum limits of the Act, then each party was entitled to a de novo trial on all issues. The arbitrator awarded the insured an amount in excess of the minimum under the Act but the trial court confirmed the award anyway, finding that the arbitration clause was one of adhesion, which violated public policy. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding the fact that both parties were bound to a low award, which the insurer was unlikely to appeal, but not bound by a high award, demonstrated that the clause only favored the insurer and was, thus, unconscionable. Therefore, the clause was unenforceable and the award was properly confirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the statute bore a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. The time limit selected was not arbitrary or unreasonable and there was a rational basis for different treatment of children subject to the dual disability of age and mental incompetence. Thus, under the rational basis test, the statute did not violate due process or equal protection. Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, criminal acquitees, who were found not guilty by reason of insanity, sought injunctive relief against defendant mental health center and sought to permit the facility director to exercise professional judgment in determining whether plaintiffs could be recommended for unsupervised, on-grounds passes. The lower court granted defendant's motion to dismiss and the court reversed in part. The court found that dismissal of most of plaintiffs' allegations was proper as the Code of Corrections overruled the Mental Health Code when the two statutes conflicted. The court concluded that the U.S. Const. amend XIV due process clause allowed restriction on the freedom of bodily movement of involuntarily committed mental patients only pursuant to a professional judgment that restrictions are necessary for security or treatment reasons. The court remanded the matter for trial as there was a question of fact as to what constituted an unsupervised on-grounds pass so that it could be determined whether defendant violated the constitutional prohibition on freedom of movement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of less than 200 grams of a substance containing methamphetamine, and driving while his driver's license was revoked. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment. Defendant was also ordered to pay reimbursement for his appointed attorney. Defendant's motion to set aside the convictions was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed methamphetamine, which was a controlled substance under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/214 (1992). The court ruled that defendant was not denied due process of law by the trial court's failure to grant him a fitness hearing because there was no evidence that he was taking psychotropic drugs during the case. However, the court vacated the trial court's order directing defendant to pay reimbursement for his appointed counsel because defendant was not granted a hearing to determine his ability to pay as required by Ill. Code Crim. P., 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/113-3.1 (1992). The case was remanded for a hearing on defendant's ability to pay reimbursement.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 305/1 et seq. (1994), granting the defendant employee benefits, penalties, and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer filed a complaint for the review of the decision of the commission modifying an arbitration award in favor of the employee pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act, 820 Ill.

On appeal, the court held that the Illinois courts had jurisdiction over the claim because the finding that the last acts for the contract's formation occurred in Illinois was not erroneous. The court affirmed the decision with respect to the length of the disability because it was a question of fact to be determined by the commission, which was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the calculation of the employee's compensation benefits because it was performed pursuant to 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/10 using the proper formula. The court reversed the award of attorney fees and penalties pursuant to &sect;&sect; 16, 19(k), and 19(l) of the Workers' Compensation Act because the employer's reliance on a conflicting medical opinion was reasonable. The medical evidence of temporary total disability was not overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Supreme Court found that the statute under which the defendant was convicted violated the Illinois Constitution. The defendant sought summary reversal of his convictions, claiming that the offense he was charged with, convicted of, and sentenced for did not exist at the time the offense allegedly occurred. The state argued that the court should deny the defendant any relief because the reenacting law should be applied retroactively. The court determined that when the supreme court invalidated the statute under which the defendant was convicted, the law became void ab initio and it was as if the law never existed. Because the reenacting law created new substantive law and became effective after the defendant was alleged to have committed the offense, it could not be applied retroactively to the defendant in this case. As a result, the defendant's conviction was invalid. The court further held, however, that since the law was void ab initio, the defendant did not have a claim of double jeopardy and the state could charge him with any other applicable offense that was in effect on the dates of the alleged acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of first degree murder in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-1(a)(1) (Supp. 1995), appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), which denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and applied the truth-in-sentencing provisions of &sect; 3-6-3 of the Unified Code of Corrections, as codified at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3 (1994), as amended by Public Act 89-404, 1995 Ill. Laws 4306, 4323-27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three days after defendant's initial guilty plea hearing, the court reconvened the hearing to clarify its admonishment regarding the effect of his previous sentence on this new sentence. At the second hearing, defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea, but the trial court refused to do so. The trial court also denied his motion to vacate the guilty plea. The trial court applied the amended truth-in-sentencing provisions, which no longer permitted day-for-day good time credit. The court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's request to withdraw his guilty plea at the second hearing and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. The court found defendant's plea to be knowing and voluntary and determined that the trial court's admonitions substantially complied with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402, 134 Ill. 2d R. 402. However, the court found that Public Act 89-404 violated the single subject rule of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) (1970) and thus its amendments to the truth-in-sentencing provisions were invalid. Defendant was therefore entitled to day-for-day good time credit under the unamended statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded the matter with directions that the trial court amend the sentencing order to reflect that defendant's eligibility for day-for-day good-time credit.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and held that it was erroneous to conclude that flyover miles were excluded simply on the basis of an &quot;in&quot; versus &quot;over&quot; analysis. The court held that a nexus was required with the Illinois transaction by which the tax was measured. There had to be a sufficient connection with the flyover miles generated by the overflights. The court held that the record amply demonstrated that the nexus requirement could not be satisfied.

The court maintained that testimony of child witnesses was sufficient to prove defendant guilty of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and that the state was not required to provide corroboration for the testimony. The court also held that medical evidence was not required to sustain a conviction for criminal sexual assault. Defendant also contended that his conviction under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-14.1 must be reversed because the statute that created the offense, 1995 Ill. Laws, 4453, 4506, had been declared unconstitutional. The state contended that the court should simply change the name of the offense from predatory criminal sexual assault of a child to aggravated criminal sexual assault under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-14. The court agreed finding that its focus was on the conduct defendant was convicted of engaging in rather than the section number of the statute that described that conduct.

Acts 89--404, that instituted &sect; 6/3--6--3(a)(2)(ii) was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule, and held that defendant was entitled to the good conduct credit that he would have been eligible to receive prior to Mich. Pub. Acts 89--404's enactment. The court held that defendant could challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 6/3--6--3(a)(2)(ii) on direct appeal because it had legal effect on the sentencing hearing and by its own terms it was not outside the scope of the sentencing proceedings. Mich. Pub. Acts 89--404 violated the single subject rule because it addressed five distinct subjects and amended nine different statutory codes, and there was no &quot;natural and logical connection&quot; uniting its various subjects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as modified as to defendant's sentence under the &quot;truth-in-sentencing&quot; provisions of the Unified Code of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of stalking the victim pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.3 (West 1994). The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that a culpability requirement was to be read into 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.3(a)(2). The court held that the stalking legislation was constitutional. The court construed the stalking statute to require two separate instances where the victim was placed in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement, or restraint. The court concluded that the evidence adequately supported finding that the victim was placed in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm as a result of defendant's persistent and unwelcome conduct. The court held that the trial judge was not required to accept defendant's version of events and that defendant's knowledge could be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case. The court found that defendant was explicitly told of the victim's concerns, ordered to stay away from her and her family, and sent a letter from the state's attorney's office detailing the effect of his actions on the victim and advising that he would be prosecuted if such conduct continued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents' son, who had been married to the mother, was the father of the child. The mother sought to end the visitation and argued that the grandparental visitation statute,&nbsp;750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/607(b) (1996), violated her fundamental parental liberty rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. The reviewing court disagreed. The state had a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child's welfare. In assessing the best interest of the child in matters of visitation, appropriate matters to consider were: (1) the nature and length of the child's relationship with persons seeking visitation and (2) the effect of visitation on the emotional and psychological well-being of the child. The state had a compelling interest in maintaining and safeguarding an established grandparent-grandchild relationship where it has been proven that it is in the child's best interest. The statute was narrowly tailored and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department denied the nurse's application for licensure by endorsement as a professional registered nurse because she failed to meet the requirement of &sect; 15 of the Illinois Nursing Act of 1987 (Act), 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 65/15 (1993), which required an applicant to pass the certifying exam within three years of the applicant's first attempt. At the time of the nurse's first attempt to pass the exam, the requirement was merely that the applicant pass the test within six attempts over an unlimited period of time. The trial court reversed the denial, and the court affirmed. The court held that the amendment to the statute could not be applied retroactively. To have denied the nurse's license by endorsement would have deprived her of a vested right because she reasonably relied on the former statute. Because the amendment significantly changed the time limit required to pass the exam, the change was substantive. The court held that the nurse was not on notice that she was required to pass the exam within three years of her first attempt after the amendment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contends he did not violate 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-13(a)(4) and that the judge erred in allowing general verdict forms for the separate counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met a 16-year-old girl and had sex with her 2 to 3 times a week until she was 17 years old. Defendant gave her money almost every time they were together, arranged for her to go to a private school, paid her tuition, and arranged for her to volunteer on his political campaign. Defendant was convicted on, among other charges, criminal sexual assault under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-13(a)(4). On appeal, he contended that there was no evidence that he held a &quot;position of trust, authority, or supervision&quot; in relation to the girl, as required by &sect; 12-13(a)(4). The court held that defendant's role as a public official did not alone create a position of trust, authority, or supervision in relation to the girl, but found that the evidence showed that he developed such a position in relation to the girl. The court noted that the girl worked on defendant's campaign, he arranged for her to go to private school and paid the tuition, and he even described himself as her &quot;mentor.&quot; The court also held that the general verdict form was proper for the separate counts because the state proceeded on a theory of an ongoing sexual relationship between the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, mayor and local liquor control commissioner, challenged the reversal by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of the local liquor control commission's (LLCC) suspension of appellee caf&eacute;'s liquor license for violating Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 4-60-140 (1990). The cafe and appellee president contested the trial court's ruling that the license appeal commission (LAC) did not have the authority to modify the LLCC's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor working undercover for the Chicago police was admitted to the caf&eacute;, requested a beer, and was served. The hearing officer determined that the defense of entrapment was inapplicable to the administrative proceeding and further found that there had been no entrapment. The LAC reduced the LLCC's five-day suspension of the cafe's liquor license for selling alcoholic liquor to a minor to a one-day suspension. The trial court found that the cafe had been entrapped and reversed the suspension entirely. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the LAC lacked authority to modify the LLCC's decision because the plain language of 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-5 (1992) enumerated the LAC's review powers to include sustaining or reversing an LLCC decision but not modifying a decision. Reversing the suspension judgment, the court ruled that the trial court erred in finding blatant entrapment. As evidentiary decisions were within the hearing officer's discretion, the entrapment defense was available when governmental misconduct was egregious. The hearing officer reasonably could determine that there was no evidence demonstrating that the cafe was induced to serve the minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment that held that the caf&eacute;'s liquor license was wrongly suspended and affirmed that portion of the judgment that ruled that the LAC lacked authority to modify a decision rendered by the LLCC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, gas consumers, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County, which dismissed the consumers' action against defendant city. The consumers contended that the Chicago Gas Use Tax Ordinance, Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 3-41-030(A) (1994), which imposed a tax on the use of natural gas purchased at retail, was an invalid occupational tax under the provisions of Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city entered into a contract with the gas company to collect taxes imposed under the ordinance. The consumers purchased natural gas at retail outside of Illinois for use in their businesses in the city. The gas was then delivered by pipeline to the gas company. According to the consumers, once their gas was in the pipeline, it was fungible and indistinguishable from gas being transported to gas company customers who purchased their gas in the city. The consumers contended that the ordinance was an unconstitutional occupation tax because it had not been authorized by the general assembly. The city countered that a tax could not be an occupation tax within the meaning of &sect; 6(e) unless it was imposed on businesses engaged in the occupation of selling the commodities taxed. Instead, the city argued that the ordinance was a tax on tangible personal property. The court agreed and affirmed, holding that natural gas was a tangible personal property, and that the tax was on the consumer, not the provider of the gas. Because the tax was placed on the consumer, it was valid under &sect; 6(e), and could not be construed as an unconstitutional service occupation tax upon a public utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court denying reconsideration of its dismissal of the consumers' complaint against the city.</SPAN></P>

The action was dismissed on the ground that it had not been filed within the statute of repose under &sect; 13-212(a) of the Limitations Act, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-212(a) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's estate filed a malpractice action against defendant doctor, alleging defendant had failed to notify decedent of test results.

Accordingly, review was sought, and the court affirmed. After rejecting the contention that &sect; 13-212(a) was unconstitutional, the court held defendant had not fraudulently concealed the decedent's cause of action, thus tolling &sect; 13-212(a), because defendant's statements had not tended to conceal the cause of action, the decedent should have discovered the concealment through ordinary diligence, and reasonable time would have remained within the repose period upon discovery. In addition, the court held the ongoing course of continuous negligent medical treatment doctrine was inapplicable because defendant's failure to notify had not been an ongoing course of continuous negligent medical treatment. Finally, the court held the decedent's disability had not affected &sect; 13-212(a) because the disability had occurred after the cause of action's accrual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit (Illinois), which granted the motion to dismiss filed by defendants, attorneys who worked as lobbyists in the county (lobbyists). The county's declaratory judgment action, seeking to uphold the Will County, Ill., Lobbyist Registration Ordinance (June 1996), was dismissed because the ordinance violated the State Lobbyist Registration Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Lobbyist Registration Act, 25 Ill. Comp. Stat. 170/1 et seq. (1996), granted counties the power to enact lobbying ordinances that were required to be &quot;similar,&quot; but not identical, to those imposed by the Act. The Will County, Ill., Lobbyist Registration Ordinance (June 1996) was challenged by a group of county attorneys, who worked as lobbyists. When the county filed an action for declaratory relief, the circuit court found that the county had exceeded its powers in enacting such an ordinance and granted the lobbyists' motion to dismiss. On the county's appeal, the court found substantial differences between the Act and the ordinance, which was much more intrusive than the requirements of the Act. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision and held that many of the ordinance's requirements were ultra vires and void. After the objectionable language had been excised, however, the court found that the remaining language was not void for vagueness merely because it did not contain definitions. Finally, the court disagreed with the lobbyists' contention that the ordinance could not regulate their activities because they were also lawyers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court, which dismissed the county's action for declaratory relief. The court held that some of the requirements of the ordinance exceeded the power delegated to the county in the state act and were void. Those parts of the ordinance in compliance with the statute were not void for vagueness, however, and the ordinance's regulation of the lobbyists, who were also attorneys, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The order of adoption was properly granted even after the trial court was aware of the putative father's identity because his rights were terminated. The putative father's constitutional right to equal protection was not violated by the Adoption Act because the definition of &quot;unfit person&quot; was reasonably related to a legitimate governmental interest. The putative father's equal protection rights were not violated by the Putative Father Registry because the registry was substantially related to important state interests in locating putative fathers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of stalking in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-7.3(a) (1976). Defendant alleged that the statute applied to innocent conduct in violation of due process was unconstitutionally overbroad, was unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;follows&quot; was not defined, and the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant followed the victim, a former friend, on three occasions. On one occasion, defendant parked his car so as to block the victims and banged on the victim's car window threatening to kill him. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that 5/12-7.3(a) punished assault, not innocent conduct. The court reasoned that the statute required proof of following and a threat that are a part of a course of conduct, not merely following. The court held that the stalking statute did not violate the Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const., amend XIV and Ill. Const., art I &sect; 2 (1970), because its use of the terms &quot;following&quot; and &quot;surveillance&quot; were sufficiently definite to put the average person on notice as to what constituted a violation. Additionally, the court found that the requirement of two separate incidents accompanied by threat or assault were sufficient to inhibit arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement based on subjective standards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11--501 (1994) in the Circuit Court for the 18th Judicial Circuit, Du Page County (Illinois). On appeal, he contended that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1--6 (Supp. 1995), which provided that the state was no longer required to prove venue at trial, was unconstitutional and that his conviction had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state asserted that the 1995 amendment to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1--6 (Supp. 1995) removed venue as an element of a criminal offense and that all objections to place of trial were waived unless raised prior to trial. Defendant argued that the amendment was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The trial court denied defendant's motion for directed verdict, finding that although the state had failed to prove venue beyond a reasonable doubt, it was not required to do so. The court concluded that the substantive element of venue was rooted in the common law and therefore it was unnecessary to address defendant's contention that the statute was invalid because of its failure to ensure defendant's knowing and intentional waiver of a constitutional right. Although venue was no longer an element of the offense, the county in which the crime was alleged to have taken place still had to be set forth in the charging instrument in order to confer jurisdiction on the trial court in a county, and an action filed in the wrong county remained subject to a motion to dismiss pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/114--1(a)(7) (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that venue was not a constitutional requirement of proof in a criminal case of drunk driving, but one of the common law abrogated by legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a fitness hearing as required by 725 Ill. Comp. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly stabbed two individuals and fought with a police officer; and pleaded guilty to attempted murder and aggravated battery. On appeal, defendant argued that he was statutorily entitled to a fitness hearing at the time of his plea because he was taking psychotropic drugs, and that the trial court's failure to conduct a fitness hearing required a new trial. The court held that: 1) the amendment to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. ILCS 5/104--21(a) (1994), which avoided the hearing requirement, was not retroactively applied because it was substantive and not procedural; 2) defendant was entitled to a fitness hearing pursuant to the original psychotropic drug statute; 3) although defendant was entitled to a fitness hearing, the remedy for the trial court's failure to conduct such was not necessarily a new trial; and 4) remand for a limited, retrospective fitness hearing was the proper remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owners appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied defendants' traverse and motion to dismiss a motion of plaintiff city's complaint for condemnation with respect to the quick take of defendants' building as part of a redevelopment financed under the Illinois Tax and Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 Ill. Cons. Stat. 5/11-74.4-1 et seq. (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed an eminent domain action to acquire defendant property owner's property, and requested a &quot;quick take&quot; hearing pursuant to 735 Ill. Cons. Stat. 5/7-103(1994). Defendants filed an amended traverse and motion to dismiss. The court affirmed a denial of defendants' traverse and motion. The condemnation of defendants' property was consistent with and did not change the general land use or the nature of the redevelopment project as provided in the redevelopment plan as amended by subsequent ordinances. Defendants failed to show that the trial court's determination that plaintiff's acquisition of defendant's property was necessary and in conformance with the Illinois Tax and Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 Ill. Cons. Stat. 5/11-74.4-1 et seq. (1994), was contrary to the weight of the evidence. Ordinances establishing and amending the redevelopment plan were not vague or uncertain that an adjacent building was at risk of condemnation, justifying condemnation of defendants' property. The &quot;quick take&quot; statute was rationally based on plaintiff's greater population density than elsewhere in Illinois and was not unconstitutional special legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying defendant property owners' traverse and motion to dismiss a motion of plaintiff city's complaint for condemnation with respect to the quick take of defendants' building as part of a redevelopment financed under the Illinois Tax and Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County (Illinois) sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment for attempted first degree murder, and a concurrent three year term for the unlawful use of a weapon.

The court held that defendant could not have challenged the constitutionality of the act that provided for truth-in-sentencing law in a direct appeal of his sentence because the application of those laws was outside the scope of the sentencing proceedings. The court further that the statement by the trial judge at sentencing had no legal effect on defendant's actual release and could not have been relief upon by defendant upon appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the dismissal of his complaint against defendant director of the state tax department by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). The taxpayer argued that he was denied due process when the director assessed taxes due and attempted to collect them. He asserted that he had no liability to the director and that the director did not have a valid lien against his individual assets or those of the joint venture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a member of a joint venture with a separate Illinois corporation. The director assigned the joint venture an Illinois Business Tax number that was different from the taxpayer's own. After an audit, the director issued to the taxpayer and to the joint venture notices of tax liability, including penalties and interest. The director placed tax liens on all property owned by the taxpayer. The taxpayer filed suit. The trial court granted the director's motion to dismiss. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the taxpayer was not denied due process in either the assessment or the collection of taxes. Due process did not require that the taxpayer be given personal notice of the assessments on the joint venture. The joint venture was treated as a partnership, and under the Uniform Partnership Act such personal notice to the taxpayer was not required. The taxpayer was not denied due process by the department's liens on his property. A tax assessment was not a judgment under 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 120/5, so appeal should have been taken to the director prior to suit. Also, relief from tax liability was by injunction not through declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of the director's motion to dismiss the complaint for declaration brought by the taxpayer. The taxpayer's due process rights were not violated by either the assessment or the collection of taxes against him and against the joint venture. Notice to the joint venture was sufficient. The lien on the taxpayer's property was not a judgment, so appeal should have been taken to the director prior to suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village enacted an ordinance whereby it declined to collect an amusement tax that was required pursuant to a county ordinance. The village enacted the ordinance to create a conflict with the county ordinance so that the village ordinance would prevail.

On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's order finding the village ordinance unconstitutional and granting a temporary injunction. In so doing, the court found that the court abused its discretion in finding the village ordinance unconstitutional because that issue was not before the trial court, nor was a constitutional determination necessary to the decision on the county's petition for a preliminary injunction that was before the court. The court further found that the order enjoining the village from enforcing its ordinance was a permanent injunction and should not have been ordered without a hearing on the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellant lender against appellee bankruptcy trustee, and on cross motions, the lender appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment to the bankruptcy trustee. The lender argued that the doctrine of lis pendens did not apply to its foreclosure action and that the bankruptcy trustee was estopped from contesting the lender's rights under the mortgage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A wife filed a marital dissolution action. At the time, she and her husband jointly owned a house. They also owed money to the lender. Both the wife and her husband informed the lender of the dissolution. The lender loaned the husband more money. The marriage was dissolved, and the wife was awarded the house. The husband was ordered to assume the loans. The lender began to a foreclosure action on the house. Both the wife and her husband filed for bankruptcy. The husband was discharged in bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy trustee for the wife was substituted as a party. The trial court granted summary judgment to the bankruptcy trustee. The lender appealed. The court reversed and remanded and held that the bankruptcy trustee was estopped from contesting the loans that should have been litigated in the dissolution proceeding. The doctrine of lis pendens was inapplicable and did not prevent the encumbrance during the dissolution action. Equitable estoppel did not apply because the lender had actual notice of the pending divorce and was not a bona fide purchaser. The lender was bound to the judgment rendered in the underlying dissolution action as if it had been a party to that action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the grant of summary judgment to the bankruptcy trustee in a foreclosure action.</SPAN></P>

A search of defendant's purse revealed the cocaine, and defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the seized evidence. On appeal, the court reversed and held that: (1) the Fourth Amendment did not require a police officer to tell a stopped motorist that they were free to leave before the officer could ask the motorist to search the vehicle; (2) Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 (1970) provided no more protection to motorists than the Fourth Amendment; and (3) the consensual search of the vehicle did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with telephone harassment and violating an order of protection after calling his ex-wife 6 to 12 times in an evening. The state argued the number of calls was per se proof that defendant was intending to harass the ex-wife. Defendant was acquitted of telephone harassment, but convicted of violating the order of protection. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was trying to talk to his children with the phone calls, but the ex-wife hung up without defendant being able to ask for his children, which was why he continued to call. The court found that there was no proof entered concerning the content of the calls. Without knowing the content of the calls, no rational trier of fact could have found defendant's purpose in making the calls was not reasonable under the circumstances, which was a required element of proof under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/103(7). Thus, the state failed to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois), which convicted him of indecent liberties with a child, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 11--4(a)(2) and 4(a)(3) (1979), and official misconduct, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33--3(b), for acts committed in the late 1970s. Defendant, who had lived in Nebraska since 1979, contended that the tolling provision of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3--7 (1996) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a high school teacher in Illinois in the late 1970s. In June 1979 he resigned his position and moved to Nebraska, where he remained. He was charged in 1995 with having sexual contact with three underage boys between August 1977 and June 1979. The trial court convicted him of two counts of indecent liberties with a child, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 11--4(a)(2) and 4(a)(3) (1979), and one count of official misconduct, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33--3(b) (1979). On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the tolling provision, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3--7 (1996), arguing that it created an impermissible distinction between Illinois residents and nonresidents in violation of the Equal Protection Clause under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Finding no impingement of a fundamental constitutional right, the court concluded that the difficulty in investigating and bringing nonresidents to justice provided a rational basis for the classification created by the tolling provision. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that the tolling provision did not violate his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upholding the constitutionality of the tolling provision, the court affirmed defendant's convictions for indecent liberties with a child and official misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of forgery and theft. On appeal, the court did not reverse the convictions but instead remanded the case for a determination of whether defendant was entitled to a competency hearing and for a factual investigation of defendant's use of psychotropic medication. The court found that the trial court was informed that defendant was taking psychotropic medication at a pretrial continuance, at defendant's appeal bond hearing, in defendant's physician's letter attached to the resentencing investigation report, and in defendant's statement during the sentencing hearing. The court ruled that this was sufficient to put the court on notice of the issue of defendant's competency. The court also found that the record lacked reliable evidence showing that defendant's receipt of lithium occurred during or near the time of the proceedings, and the record failed to show in what manner the drug may have influenced defendant's mental faculties, temperament, and behavior in the courtroom. Thus, the court ruled that a limited remand was necessary to make a factual determination of defendant's use of psychotropic drugs during the critical stages of the litigation.</SPAN></P>

The arrestee's argument that because the firearm had been suppressed at his criminal trial that it should have been suppressed in the administrative hearing was rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An arrestee brought suit to recover a fine imposed by the department for an unregistered firearm recovered from his vehicle during an arrest. The arrestee argued that the search of the vehicle violated U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970). A trial court affirmed the decision of the department and the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that despite its broad deterrent purpose, the exclusionary rule had never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons. The court found that the exclusionary rule did not apply to the case as advocated by the arrestee. The court found that in examining the costs of applying the exclusionary rule, the department would have been unable to consider valuable and relevant evidence that would have impeded the truth-finding function of the hearing officer, as was usually the case when the exclusionary rule was employed.

Comp. Stat. 5/104-21(a) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an Alford plea to the charge of attempted first-degree murder at the time he was taking sinequan, a psychotropic drug. The version of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/104-21(a) (1995) in effect at the time of his sentencing was found to be unconstitutional. Defendant argued that the previous version of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/104-21(a) (1994) governed his sentencing and required that he be granted a new trial because he was taking a psychotropic drug when he was sentenced. Section 104-21(a) was amended during the pendency of defendant's appeal following the declaration that it was unconstitutional, and the amended statute,&nbsp;725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/104-21(a) (1996), stated that there was no presumption that a person was unfit to stand trial merely because that person was taking psychotropic drugs. The court held that the amended &sect; 104-21(a) was procedural and could be applied to defendant's sentencing. Therefore, the matter was remanded to the lower court with directions to examine whether the sinequan had compromised defendant's ability to plead. On the remand, there was to be no presumption that the sinequan made defendant unfit to plead.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 100/10-55(c) (1992). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) awarded attorney's fees in the full amount requested by the dentist. The Department of Professional Regulation asserted that the court should not have awarded the full amount requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dentist was sanctioned by defendant Department of Professional Regulation for various advertising slogans. The dentist challenged the regulations and the sanction imposed and was successful in invalidating some of the regulations. The dentist then sought to recover attorney's fees incurred under the provisions of 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 100/10-55(c) (1992). The trial court awarded attorney's fees in the full amount requested by the dentist. The court affirmed the award of attorney's fees for the invalidation because it concluded that the action that went to the Illinois Supreme Court invalidated at least one administrative rule, and under 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 100/10-55(c) (1992) the dentist was entitled to reasonable fees incurred in the entire action culminating in the supreme court's decision. The court reversed and remanded the matter for an analysis of reasonableness of the fee because the trial court had accepted the invoice for the attorney's fees after it determined that there was entitlement to the fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination that plaintiff dentist was entitled to fees incurred throughout the administrative action that resulted in the invalidation of the regulation against defendant Department of Professional Regulation but reversed and remanded the award of fees in the amount of $ 58,881 with instructions that the trial court conduct a more thorough reasonableness analysis because no analysis of the fee was made at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that entered an order of adoption in favor of appellee adoptive parents and dismissed appellant's parentage petition by reason of his failure to comply with the provisions of the Adoption Act regarding the timely registration with the Putative Father Registry, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/12.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative challenged the circuit court's dismissal of his petition to determine parentage by reason of his failure to comply with Adoption Act provisions requiring timely registration with the Putative Father Registry, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/12.1. Appellant claimed that his failure to register should have been excused because of the biological mother's misrepresentation concerning the identity of the child's father. Appellant also argued that he was denied equal protection because he was treated differently from fathers whose parental rights were regulated by the Illinois Juvenile Court Act, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1-1 et seq. The court held that because appellant failed to timely register and did not allege facts that would bring him within the exceptions to section 12.1(g) of the Adoption Act, he was barred from maintaining his parentage petition, which was properly dismissed. The court also held that a putative father who, like appellant, did not register and initiate paternity proceedings was not entitled to section 2-30 notice under the Juvenile Court Act; and the purported difference in the notice requirements of the two Acts argued by appellant did not exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court judgment that dismissed appellant putative father's parentage petition because appellant failed to register with the Putative Father Registry as required by the Adoption Act, and thus, was not entitled to notice or opportunity to be heard in the adoption proceedings. The court also held that the birth mother's misrepresentation regarding the child's father did not excuse appellant's obligation to register.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction entered in the Circuit Court, Knox County (Illinois) following a bench trial, where she was found guilty but mentally ill of three counts of forgery and sentenced to a four-year prison term. She contended that the trial court failed to conduct a fitness hearing despite evidence she was taking psychotropic drugs under medical direction, and that her sentence was excessive given the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant knowingly delivered forged checks drawn on a bank that was not then in business. She testified that due to her mental state at the time of the offense, her ability to understand the criminality of her conduct was questionable. A licensed psychiatrist was called in rebuttal, and testified that she appeared coherent and was not delusional or acting oddly, and he did not believe that she lacked the ability to appreciate the criminality of her conduct at the time of the offense. The applicable statute was amended twice since the offense. The question presented was whether the Second Amendment was procedural and could be applied retroactively, or whether the original statute governed. In light of the importance the legislature placed on the right of an accused taking psychotropic medication to receive a fitness hearing under the original statute, the court found that the second amended statute effectuated a substantive change in the law and could not be applied retroactively, as it would deprive the defendant of the accrued right to a mandatory fitness hearing. Automatic reversal was not the appropriate remedy, as the facts were suitable for a case-specific fitness hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the convictions with directions for a limited fitness hearing to determine defendant's fitness to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother and father, were the minor child's biological parents. However, the child was born while the mother was married to appellee first husband. The Circuit Court of Peoria County (Illinois) granted the first husband visitation with the child. The mother and father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father contended that because the first husband was not the child's biological father, he should not have been granted visitation absent a compelling reason why he should have been permitted to interfere with their constitutionally protected parental rights. The mother and father further contended that the trial court erred in finding that permanent visitation was in the child's best interests. The court held that &sect; 607(a) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/607(a), governed the first husband's visitation rights and that the first husband was entitled to reasonable visitation. The court found that it was clear that the visitation did not endanger the child's physical, mental, moral, or emotional health. The mother and father did not raise their constitutional claim until the close of the custody hearing. At that time, they did not identify what constitutional provision afforded them protection against visitation; therefore, they waived the argument that a standard for nonbiological parents other that &sect; 607(a) was constitutionally compelled.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that self defense did not entitle defendant to a provocation instruction based on mutual combat and the state presented evidence that defendant intended to rob the store and instigated the combat. The court determined that defendant did not preserve the issue of the trial court's response o the jury's question because the defense counsel agreed to the trial court's response and the issue was not included in defendant's posttrial motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of delivery of a controlled substance and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an undercover officer informed defendant that his boss needed a cocaine supplier, defendant informed the officer that he could obtain cocaine. Defendant was arrested as he was weighing a controlled substance in preparation to deliver it to the officer. An initial conviction of defendant for delivering a controlled substance and for theft was set aside because the theft statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction at a second trial on charges of delivering a controlled substance. The second trial was not barred by federal or state constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy because defendant, not the state, was responsible for joining the charge of delivery with the theft charge in the first trial. The trial court gave a limiting instruction regarding the relevance of evidence of other crimes and did not abuse its discretion in admitting that evidence to rebut defendant's defense of entrapment. By failing to object at trial defendant waived error as to the introduction of other evidence. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's rejection of defendant's entrapment defense because defendant was predisposed to commit the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant's entire argument rested on the claim that his use of Valium made him unfit to stand trial. The trial court did not conduct a fitness hearing, and the court affirmed. The court noted that under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/104-10 (1994) a defendant was presumed to be fit to stand trial, plead, and be sentenced, but he could be found unfit to stand trial if he was unable to understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings against him or to assist in his defense. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not conducting a fitness hearing because defendant never informed it he was taking Valium at the time of the trial. Defendant's own examining psychologist did not find him unfit to stand trial. The trial court took great pains to assure that defendant's medication was not affecting his ability to understand the proceedings and cooperate in his defense. Because the trial court had a duty to order a fitness hearing sua sponte if there was a bona fide doubt of defendant's fitness and since defendant demonstrated no entitlement to a fitness hearing, defendant was not prejudiced by the failure of defense counsel to request a fitness hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a racing board, its individual members, and two stewards of a racetrack, sought review of an order of the circuit court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted an injunction in favor of plaintiff racehorse rider that restrained defendants from enforcing a revocation of the racehorse rider's license to own and drive standardbred racehorses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The racehorse rider's license was revoked and he was declared ineligible for future licensing when the stewards found that he had furthered an unlawful betting scheme by failing to give his best effort in two races. The racehorse rider sought and received an injunction that restrained defendants from enforcing the revocation. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the racehorse rider was barred from seeking injunctive relief from the circuit court because he did not exhaust any of his administrative remedies. The court held that the third exception to the exhaustion of remedies doctrine, that irreparable harm would result from further pursuit of administrative remedies, did not call for an injunction preempting any attempt at resolving the matter administratively. Further, the court held that the hearing was to be held only five days after the racehorse rider filed his complaint, and that the loss of income and future business for a brief period pending administrative proceedings did not constitute irreparable harm. Accordingly, the court held that the racehorse rider prematurely filed his complaint and that the trial court erred in granting the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the circuit court, which had granted an injunction in favor of the racehorse rider.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of assault, in violation of Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 8-4-080 (1990), the trial court twice denied defendant's motion to declare that the ordinance was unconstitutional, but ruled that the mandatory minimum sentence exceeded the city's home rule authority. The city sought review. On appeal, the court held that Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 8-4-080 (1990) was properly within the city's home rule authority and that state law did not preempt the authority of the city to set a mandatory minimum penalty of imprisonment for violation of its ordinance. The court held that reversal of the trial court's sentence would not subject defendant to another trial or to additional punishment. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to follow the penalty provision of the city's ordinance. The court held that the city's choice to have a sentencing scheme that was different from the state's was well within the city's constitutional powers as a home rule unit. Therefore, the court reversed the sentence that was imposed by the trial court and remanded the matter for sentencing only.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 125/0.01 et seq. (1996), and convicted one defendant of indirect criminal contempt of court and sentenced him to 180 days in jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hunting club sought to enjoin the activists from violating the Hunter Interference Prohibition Act (Act), 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 125/0.01 et seq. (1996), by scaring game away from the club by using sirens, bull-horns, and an engine-powered glider. The club obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) against such practices. The circuit court issued a permanent injunction against the activists prohibiting any conduct violating the Act, found one activist in indirect criminal contempt for violating the TRO, and sentenced him to 180 days in jail. On appeal, the court affirmed the injunction, the contempt conviction, and sentence. The court held that the Act was not overly broad or unconstitutional because its criminal prohibitions were content-neutral: it did not single out any particular thought or opinion for prohibition. Its legitimate sweep was clear: to prevent intentional disturbance during the dangerous time of the hunt when loaded weapons were legally carried. The court further held that the circuit court's failure to recite the words &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; did not require reversal of the conviction. Finally, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss because he had previously entered a guilty plea to the charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle based on the same incident. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle was a lesser included offense of the offenses of robbery, armed robbery, vehicular hijacking, and aggravated vehicular hijacking and that the state was barred by the doctrine of double jeopardy from pursuing them. The court held that double jeopardy applied. The court found that prosecution of a lesser included offense prevented the subsequent prosecution of the greater offense, and that the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause forbid successive prosecution and cumulative punishment for a greater and lesser included offense. Possession of a stolen motor vehicle was a lesser included offense of the charges because the taking of a motor vehicle as required in the vehicular hijacking offenses included unauthorized possession and knowledge that the vehicle was stolen, and the specific intent offense of theft was a lesser included offense of the general intent offense of armed robbery despite the differing mental states. The same facts that would prove the possession of a stolen motor vehicle would prove the other offenses and that prevented the state from pursuing successive prosecutions for the greater offenses.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/143(a) (1996) unconstitutional, and to recover damages for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of the negligent driving of an uninsured motorist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured filed a compliant against her insurer seeking a declaration that a clause in her insurance contract was void as against public policy and that 215 Ill.

The complaint also sought to recover damages for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of the negligent driving of an uninsured motorist. The insurer filed a motion to dismiss the insured's complaint. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the insured appealed, contending that an arbitration clause in the policy allowed the insurer to bind the insured to a low arbitration award and permitted the insurer to unilaterally reject a high award. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and held that the insured's complaint was ripe for adjudication, that the involuntary nature of the arbitration clause coupled with its structural inequality rendered it unconscionable and unenforceable, and that 5/143(a) was violative of the right to contract. The means adopted by the legislature were not rationally related to its goal of placing the injured insured in the same position she would have occupied had the uninsured motorist been minimally insured.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent minor, adjudicated delinquent, appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), contending that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-15(b) was unconstitutionally vague and violated due process because it contained no minimum objective standards to determine which of two minors who engaged in consensual sex was the accused and which was the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that relations between the two minors were consensual, the minor was found delinquent on two counts of criminal sexual abuse, and the circuit court ordered the case closed, but indicated that its adjudication of delinquency was to stand. The minor appealed, alleging that the statute was unconstitutional, but the court found that the statute was sufficiently clear. Once the minor victim filed her complaint alleging that the minor subjected her to an offense prohibited by the statute, the legislative definitions of the terms &quot;accused&quot; and &quot;victim&quot; were sufficient objective standards to guide law enforcement officials for purposes of prosecution. There was a rational relationship between the age classification created by the statute and the purpose behind the statute. Thus, the court rejected the minor's vagueness challenge. Further, the statutory schemes were constitutional. Thus, the judgment of the circuit court's finding of delinquency as to the two counts of criminal sexual abuse was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no constitutional deficiencies in the criminal sexual abuse statute, the court affirmed the minor's adjudication of delinquency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class of producers for defendant insolvent insurer, filed an action, seeking, inter alia, a declaration of their right to set off claims against insolvent insurer for commissions against premiums that were due. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted producers' motion in part. Insolvent insurer appealed, and producers filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Producers solicited clients for insolvent insurers, collecting the premiums and holding them in trust for insolvent insurer. In granting summary judgment for producers, the trial court held that the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, governed the parties' relationship and superseded the liquidation order and that producers were entitled to deduct their earned commissions from the premiums that they held in trust for insolvent insurer. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the Contract Clause governed the parties' relationship, as &sect; 206 of the Illinois Insurance Code, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/206 (1996), was in existence at the time the contract was formed and, thus, became an implied provision of the contract. Insolvent insurer argued that &sect; 206 precluded the set off of the earned premiums that had not been credited prior to liquidation because there was no longer mutuality between the parties. The court held that the set off was improper, as there was no mutuality between the parties because producers acted as fiduciaries by holding the collected premiums in trust for insolvent insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, remanding the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor by public guardian appealed the grant of his parents' motion for substitution of judge by right in the state's neglect petition on behalf of the minor. The parents argued that they would not receive an impartial hearing because the mother's other children were already before the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of the motion for substitution of judge by right. The court rejected the minor's argument that allowing substitution would result in two or more judges hearing the same case and possibly reaching different conclusions. The court found that no party in the appeal adequately addressed the rights of the man who took care of one of the parents' other children. The court also found that 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-10-(10) (1994) applied to the instant proceeding and did not support the minor's attempt to extend the definition of &quot;a case&quot; to encompass all &quot;cases&quot; related to the same family. The court further found that the Juvenile Court Act's remedial purpose was not exclusive to the minor, but also recognized a parent's right to an impartial judge.</SPAN></P>

The owner directed him to attach the VIN from the car to the one stamped on the front clip, so that the VIN was consistent. The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the trial court concluded that the alteration of the VIN number was an attempt to defraud the public by hiding the fact that the car was a mixture of two cars that were welded together. On appeal, defendant asserted that &sect; 5/1-103(a)(2) was unconstitutional because it did not require a criminal purpose and constituted a punishment of innocent conduct. The court distinguished case law presented by defendant because the offenses from the cases were based on a person's mere possession of an improper item. Defendant was knowingly responsible for the alteration of the VIN. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the punishment was disproportionate to the crime because defendant had knowledge that the car was to be sold to the public.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/3-103 et seq. (1994). The officer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent of police filed charges against an officer before the Police Board of the City of Chicago.

The officer named the Police Board of the City of Chicago as a defendant, but failed to name the superintendent of police. The board filed a motion to dismiss that was granted. The lower court dismissed the case. The officer sought review, contending that the provision of the administrative review law, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-103 et seq. (1994), that limited its application to municipalities with a population of 500,000 or less was unconstitutional. The court agreed with this contention, finding that no rational difference of situation or condition existed between the complaints filed by plaintiffs in Chicago and complaints filed by plaintiffs outside Chicago, since both are allowed to file complaints for administrative review in the first instance. As a result, the court held that the lower court erred in dismissing the officer's complaint and denying leave to amend. The court held that the language of the act violated the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the efficient operation of the collector's office pertained to county government and affairs and was therefore a proper subject of regulation under the home rule provision of the constitution.

She and her husband approached the state's attorney and told him that their daughter was not there because she lived in Chicago.

Defendant argued that the circuit court should have granted her motion to suppress the statement because it was a part of plea negotiations and because she had not been informed of her Miranda rights. The circuit court noted that defendant had not been charged before she made her statement. It also found that the state's attorney did not elicit the statement. On appeal, the court found that defendant's voluntary and spontaneous statement regarding a charge against her daughter was clearly not part of a plea discussion. It also noted that entitlement to a Miranda warning is triggered only when a defendant is subjected to custodial interrogation or otherwise deprived of her freedom. Her statement, which was voluntarily, was admissible at trial. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that appellant's attempt to cross-examine the expert was properly prohibited because the witness indicated only expertise with regard to the requirements of the act, not any knowledge as to the permissible duties of a medical assistant, which was the nature of the testimony sought by appellant. The court further determined that there was sufficient evidence of appellant's guilt because there was testimony that she performed the duties of a nurse without being licensed and asserted no basis for authority to perform those functions under any statute. The court further held that the act was not unconstitutionally overly broad as asserted by appellant because the prohibitions were clearly spelled out in the act's provisions, but permitted the nursing functions to be performed by properly licensed persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging the judgment which convicted him of stalking, defendant claimed that: (1) the trial court erred in refusing his waiver of a jury trial; (2) the stalking statute, 720 Ill. Gen. Stat. 5/12-7.3 (1994), was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; (3) the trial court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing on defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel; and (4) the stalking instruction was improper because it did not include language on defendant's claim of self-defense. The court found that because defendant's attempted jury waiver was made after the jury was impaneled and sworn, whether to accept it was within the trial court's discretion, which it did not abuse. The court found that the stalking statute adequately set forth what conduct was and was not lawful, and was sufficiently narrow to prevent arbitrary enforcement; hence, the court rejected the vagueness and overbreadth claims. The court found that an evidentiary hearing was not required on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and that defendant did not show plain error with respect to the jury instruction, which was necessary because he had waived the issue by not objecting at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of controlled substance trafficking. He appealed, claiming that the cocaine found in his apartment was inadmissible because the search was based on an anticipatory search warrant not then authorized by statute. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the good faith exception applied. Based on a subsequent case, the state supreme court vacated the court's decision and remanded the case for reconsideration. The court again affirmed the conviction. The case upon which the supreme court relied held that the good faith exception did not apply to a search pursuant to a warrant issued under a statute later found to be unconstitutional. In the instant case, the statute providing for anticipatory warrants, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/108-3 (1992), was not determined to be unconstitutional. Rather, the statute was found to be ambiguous. Thus, the case relied upon by the supreme court did not prohibit application of the good faith exception to the instant case. Assessing the credibility of witnesses was a function reserved to the trier of fact. Thus, the trial court's decision to believe the testimony of the officers over that of defendant was not disturbed.</SPAN></P>

Seller purchased the seeds from defendant association, which had a limited liability provision. Association purchased seeds from center and delivered them directly to buyer. Seller counterclaimed against buyer and association. Association filed a third party claim for indemnification against center. The trial court awarded damages: to buyer from seller; to seller from association; and to association from center. Association and center appealed. The court found center participated only after it had no further recourse. The contract between association and center was between two Missouri residents and, therefore, there was no making or performance of a contract substantially connected with Illinois. The delivery of the seeds to seller was not sufficient contact. Thus, the court found that center was not subject to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-209(a)(7) (1994), of the long-arm statute. Further, mutuality of agreement to limit liability to the purchase price of the seeds was not present between seller and association.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the GBMI statute violated defendant's due process rights by encouraging compromise verdicts because the GBMI verdict misled and confused jurors into believing they could assign a lower level of culpability, and a correspondingly lower level of punishment, to a mentally ill defendant; and (2) the allocation of the burden of proof under the current version of the GBMI statute resulted in defendant being required to prove something that was fundamentally at odds with his defense of insanity because in order to obtain a GBMI conviction, defendant had to prove the existence of a culpable state of mind which he had maintained throughout the trial did not exist.

The trial court confirmed the award. Subsequently, the Indiana court of appeals reversed the Indiana trial court and held that Indiana courts did have jurisdiction. Based on the Indiana court of appeals decision, the district filed a petition to vacate or modify the order, which was denied. The court affirmed and held that the trial court did not err in finding that Illinois had jurisdiction over the award. If the Illinois court had not accepted jurisdiction, the partnership would then have had no forum for enforcing the award. The decision of the trial court to confirm the award was not in derogation of any Indiana decision and thus, it did not abridge the Full Faith and Credit Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public library district levied a building and equipment tax. The objectors paid the tax under protest and filed a timely objection. The trial court held that the levy violated &sect; 18-190(a) of the Tax Cap Act, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/18-190(a) (1994) because it had not been approved by direct referendum. The county collector appealed. The court reversed the judgment. Section 18-190(a) applied only to rates which were newly authorized by statute or rate limits that where increased by statute. For years, public library districts were authorized to levy a building and maintenance tax at a rate of 0.02 percent. Because the tax was authorized prior to the levy at issue herein, the tax was not a new rate. Moreover, the tax rate was not increased. Thus, &sect; 18-190 did not apply. The public library district's authority to impose taxes did not expire annually merely because it was required to pass an ordinance each year a tax was levied. The tax was not an additional tax because &sect; 18-190 had a different purpose than taxes levied under the Public Library Act, 75 Ill. Comp. Stat. 16/35-5(a) (1994).</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed an action alleging that appellees were negligent and sought to bar the admission of the toxicology report. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the jury's verdict for appellees. The court held that because appellees provided a certified record, which the medical examiner kept in the ordinary course of business, and the preparer of the record was available to both parties, they had met the foundational requirements to admit the toxicology report. The court found that appellant failed to establish a violation of those statutory requirements; thus the toxicology report was properly admitted as a public record. Finally, the court held that comments made by appellees' attorney were not inappropriate, did not grossly mischaracterize appellant's arguments and did not amount to a personal attack on appellant's attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer overpaid unemployment insurance assessments. The employer had received credit for the overpayments, but the credit was later removed. The employer complained to the director, but the director would not hear the claim because the employer had waited too long. The employer sued the director in a class action suit. It contended that the director had improperly refused to return to it and other class members credits which had previously been given. The trial court dismissed the suit because the employer did not pursue its administrative remedies. The court affirmed. The director stopped giving and rolling over credits when the law changed, requiring the director to pay interest on refunds of erroneously paid contributions, under 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2201.1 (1992). The employer did not file a claim within the three-year limit of &sect; 2201. The employer did not have an independent lawsuit for damages. Stripped of excess verbiage, the employer's lawsuit was an attempt to obtain a refund of the employer's overpayments. Failure to exhaust administrative remedies was fatal to the case.</SPAN></P>

Under the &quot;water's edge&quot; method of combined reporting, royalty and interest paying foreign subsidiaries were similar to non-related domestic third-party customers of the taxpayer in that none of the income of the foreign subsidiary or the non-related third-party was included in the income allocable to the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery, and she filed a timely notice of appeal. Defendant contended that the aggravated robbery statute, &sect; 5/18-5, was unconstitutionally vague and that she was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that &sect; 5/18-5 provided sufficiently definite standards to guide officers and fact finders and to minimize the danger of arbitrary enforcement. The court ruled that &sect; 5/18-5 did not give the police inordinate discretion in determining whether to make an arrest because the statute defined criminal conduct in terms of the acts' effects upon the victim's state of mind. The court held that the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that the showup identification was sufficiently reliable because the witness had an opportunity to observe defendant during the robbery, defendant closely matched the witness's description, and the identification procedures occurred approximately two hours after the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charge of burglary in reliance on an admonishment by the trial court that in doing so, he could receive a sentence of six to thirty years imprisonment. At defendant's sentencing hearing, the state introduced a certified copy of defendant's conviction for a class C felony in Iowa, to which defendant did not object. Based upon that and other evidence, the trial court determined that defendant was a candidate for an extended-term sentence and imposed a 10 year term of imprisonment. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed, holding that because defendant was advised upon entering his guilty plea that he was subject to the range of penalty within which he was ultimately sentenced and he did not thereafter file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, defendant was not entitled to relief from his sentence. The court found that defendant was given the opportunity to withdraw his plea and was not precluded from doing so within the required 30-day period. The court concluded that defendant failed to show how the extended-term statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, but found that the trial court's interpretation was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Board of Education of the City of Chicago applied a two-percent local business preference (LBP) to award bus contracts for the 1996-97 and 1998-99 school years, the unsuccessful bidders, whose bid as a joint venture was the lowest bid but for application of the LBP, filed an action to compel the Board of Education to apply the LBP to their bid or, in the alternative, to invalidate the LBP. The court ruled that the two-percent LBP had no proper legislative authority, was an arbitrary and capricious delegation of power to a municipal unit, and was therefore unconstitutional. The court further ruled that the unsuccessful bidders were estopped from challenging the validity of the two-percent LBP because they did not so within a reasonable time where they were aware of the adoption of the LPB in March 1996, knew that they did not qualify for the LBP, and did not seek to invalidate the LBP until July 1996, when the awards were made, and also where the Board of Education as well as the successful bidders who had been awarded the contracts had incurred obligations in reliance on the award.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's convictions and sentences for armed violence, holding that the elements of aggravated vehicular hijacking, which carried a minimum sentence of seven years, were identical to those of armed violence predicated on vehicular hijacking, which carried a minimum sentence of 15 years. Furthermore, the elements of armed robbery, which carried a minimum sentence of six years, were identical to those of armed violence predicated on robbery, which carried a minimum sentence of 15 years. The court found that the disparities in the penalties for armed violence predicated on both the robbery and vehicular hijacking while armed with a category 1 weapon were unconstitutionally disproportionate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two accomplices committed an armed robbery of two men. One of the accomplices killed the victims while defendant stood nearby with a shotgun. A jury convicted defendant of armed robbery and two counts of first-degree murder. The trial court sentenced defendant to natural life in prison for the two murders. He sought review of the murder convictions and his sentence. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the mandatory life imprisonment provision contained in &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(c) of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c) (1994), violated Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because it did not consider his rehabilitative potential. It noted that similar constitutional challenges had been rejected in those situations where the defendant was either the actual killer or an accomplice to the killer. Furthermore, the focus of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c) (1994) was the nature of the homicides, not the defendant's role in them. Therefore, the court found that Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 was not violated when 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c) (1994) was applied to those defendants found guilty by accountability.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, holding that to successfully attack the validity of a zoning ordinance, it was not enough to show that the property could reasonably have been zoned differently. Additionally, although plaintiffs might have shown that the subject property could reasonably have been zoned R-4, that was not enough to prove that the property's existing classification was arbitrary and unreasonable. Instead, their concession that the M1-1 restriction was consistent with other uses in the area supported a conclusion that the existing zoning was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lienholder challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment to plaintiff property owner on its claim for a declaratory judgment and ruled that defendant forfeited its mechanic's lien by failing to commence an action to foreclose the lien within 30 days after receipt of plaintiff's written demand to sue, as required by section 34 of the Mechanics Lien Act, 770 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant lienholder filed a mechanic's lien against plaintiff's shopping center, it received a certified letter from plaintiff stating that filing the lien constituted a breach of the construction contract and demanding that defendant either immediately release the lien or bring suit to enforce it. Plaintiff then sought a declaratory judgment that defendant forfeited its mechanic's lien by failing to commence an action to foreclose its lien within 30 days after receipt of plaintiff's written demand to sue, as required by section 34 of the Mechanic's Lien Act (act), 770 Ill. Comp. Stat. 60/34. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and declared the lien null and void. On appeal, the court affirmed. Plaintiff's letter was a written demand to sue under the act, even though it did not reference the act or the requirement that defendant file a lien enforcement suit within 30 days. Plaintiff was not estopped by reason of the fact that it participated in settlement negotiations and requested defendant's help with paper work after sending out the demand letter. The time limitations in the act were jurisdictional and not subject to waiver or estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of plaintiff property owner because plaintiff's letter to defendant lienholder satisfied the written demand requirements of the mechanics' lien statute and triggered the tolling of the 30-day limitation period.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 15/11 (1994), and for injunctive relief to require petitioner mother to provide full access to their children. The father also challenged the constitutionality of 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 20/23 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's petition for child support, which was filed in Florida, was submitted to the trial court in Illinois, whereupon the parties consented to an agreed order requiring the father to pay weekly child support for their children. The father sought to stay the agreed RURESA support order until the mother allowed him full access to his children. In the alternative, he requested that the trial court declare 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 20/23 (1994) unconstitutional. The trial court denied the requested relief, holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the father alleged that the trial court improperly denied his motion seeking injunctive and other relief and improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing on the issues. In affirming the trial court's order, the court held that the trial court properly determined Florida, rather than Illinois, was the appropriate forum in which to raise the father's claims regarding visitation rights. 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 20/23, 20/32 (1994) specifically provided a limitation on subject matter and personal jurisdiction, and those limitations were rationally related to a legitimate state interest in enforcing child support obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied the father his requested relief and established a payment plan for child support arrearages owed to the mother.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/205(1) (1994), to be constitutional. The law firm, who represented the insurance company, had filed a petition for attorneys' fees in the liquidation action brought against the insurance company by appellees, the Director of Insurance and the Illinois Insurance Guaranty Fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the eve of trial in the liquidation action, the law firm filed a petition for attorneys' fees for trial preparation. The law firm challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 205 of the Insurance Code, which governed the way assets of an insurance company were distributed after liquidation. General creditors were listed fifth in priority and included claims for attorneys' fees incurred by the insurance company in a liquidation action. The trial court found the scheme under &sect; 205 to be constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 205 was not unconstitutional. The law firm had standing to bring the appeal because the law firm's injury-in-fact was clear; the law firm claimed over $ 50,000 worth of pre-trial work, and there was a possibility that it would not be paid. On the constitutionality issue, the court found that, although the insurance company had a constitutional right to obtain counsel, &sect; 205's impediment to attorneys' fees was not an unconstitutional infringement of the right to counsel. Because the right to pay attorneys first was not a constitutionally protected right, the state could properly enact a scheme that ranked attorneys with other creditors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that found that a provision of the Insurance Code, which governed the distribution of assets of an insurance company after liquidation, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/12-21-a(2) and (3) (1992). Defendants were thereafter sentenced to 30 months' probation and 1,000 hours of community service. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was the wife's elderly uncle and he resided in a room in defendants' home. Paramedics found the victim in a coma in a fetal position in his room, covered with feces and urine. The medical evidence established that the victim had no nutritional intake for at least one week, that his rigid fetal position took at least two weeks to develop, and that his deep coma had to have existed for several days before his hospitalization. The court upheld the convictions. First, defendants waived their right to argue that the statute under which they were prosecuted was unconstitutionally vague because they failed to sufficiently develop their argument or provide authority. Second, the statute did not violate equal protection because it exempted professionally licensed caregivers. Such caregivers were already regulated by the state. Thus, there existed a rational basis for exempting them. Third, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that defendants were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the statute specifically precluded as a defense a defendant's alleged mistake of fact as to whether the victim was disabled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

The landowners appealed the trial court's granting of summary judgment for the counties. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

The store contended that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-621, as amended, applied retroactively; thus, dismissal was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that infant had a vested right in her negligence cause of action against store. Store conceded in its brief that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-621, prior to its amendment in 1995, did not affect infant's right to sue store on a negligence theory. The court recognized, prior to the enactment of the amendment at issue, the existence of a common law right for a plaintiff to maintain an action against a non-manufacturer under theories other than strict liability. The court found it was compelled to apply &sect; 2-621 prospectively in order to avoid the unconstitutional result posed by retroactive application of the statute as amended. It was immaterial whether the legislature intended retroactive application of the amendment. The legislature lacked constitutional authority to retroactively enact a law that purported to impair vested rights, despite any expressed legislative intent.

Const. art. IX, &sect; 4 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The townships in Tazewell County had not conducted a true fair market assessment of property within the county for over 20 years. Instead, the townships conducted yearly mass appraisals wherein the increase in value of the property within the whole county was ascertained and every parcel of property was given a proportionate increase based upon that property's historical value as of the last fair market assessment. Thus, many parcels of land were undervalued, including the landowners' property. Following complaints about undervalued land, a small number of parcels, including that of the landowners' were appraised at their true market value. The Board of Review, the Appeal Board, and the lower court upheld the assessment on the landowners' property. The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, holding that &sect; 4 required uniformity in the application of taxes. The court ruled that the fact that the landowners' property was undervalued was irrelevant because the landowners were taxed by the use of a radically different method of assessment than most other township property owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment, which held that the landowners' property was correctly assessed. The matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, deceased's parents, challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which dismissed their wrongful death and survival actions against defendants, county and forest preserve, finding they were immunized by &sect; 5--1(N) of the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 40/5--1(N) (1994), and &sect; 3--109 of the Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/3--109 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased was a passenger on a snowmobile that was struck by an oncoming snowmobile. The operator of the deceased's mobile crossed lanes in front of the approaching mobile as the marked signs directed. Such a route was expressly prohibited under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 40/5--2(B) (1994). The bridge where the collision occurred was owned and maintained by the county. The parents' second amended complaint alleged that the county and the forest preserve were negligent and wilful and wanton in their approval of a dangerous and unsafe snowmobile trail. The trial court granted the county and forest preserves' motion to dismiss. The parent's appealed. The court concluded that 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 40/5--1(N) completely immunized the county and the forest preserve from the allegations contained in the parents' complaint. Further, the court found that the parents failed to allege that the forest preserve had contractually waived the immunities provided under the Snowmobile Act when it purchased insurance. And finally, the court rejected the contention that the purchase of an insurance policy was not a waiver of immunity, absent specific contractual waiver.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and remanded the judgment of the trial court granting immunity to the county and forest preserve.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney general sought interlocutory review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied reconsideration of the circuit court's appointment of a private attorney as special attorney general to represent defendant trustee in an action by plaintiff citizen against defendants, public officials and trustees, challenging the University Act, Pub. Act 89-5 (effective Jan. 1, 1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The University Act (Act), Pub. Act 89-5 (effective Jan. 1, 1996), terminated the unexpired terms of existing elected university trustees and replaced them with appointed trustees. The citizen brought a declaratory action against defendants to challenge the Act. At the request of the trustee, the circuit court appointed a private attorney as special attorney general to represent her and denied appellant's motion for reconsideration. Appellant sought interlocutory review of the order. The court held that (1) under the State Employee Indemnification Act, 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 350/2(b) (1996), elected officials were entitled to retain their own attorneys to represent them without interference from appellant, (2) under 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. 350/2(e)(i) (1996), the costs of providing a defense were to be reimbursed, and (3) because appellant had a conflict with the trustee's desire to challenge the constitutionality of the Act, it was proper to appoint private counsel to abate that conflict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the motion for reconsideration was affirmed and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
