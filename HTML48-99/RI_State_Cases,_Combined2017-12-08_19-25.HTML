</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, juvenile, appealed from an adjudication of delinquency based on a determination that he committed second-degree sexual assault under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-37-4(2) (1956). Respondent argued error by the lower court in disregarding contradictions in the victim's testimony and in finding the victim credible; the evidence did not support the conviction; and the law requiring juveniles to register as sex offenders was unconstitutional. The court found, given the victim's testimony concerning the events and the trial justice's ability to observe the demeanor, tone, and attitude of the witnesses, the credibility determinations were not clearly wrong. The court found that on the basis of the victim's testimony, it was clear the State established the necessary force or coercion to satisfy the statutory requirements of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;11-37-4(2). Respondent's final argument did not fit into the constitutional exception to the rule that the issue must have been raised at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed; the court found the lower court's determinations regarding the victim's credibility were not clearly erroneous and would not be disturbed, sufficient evidence existed to support the conviction since the victim's testimony established the necessary statutory elements for second-degree sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III, &sect; 8 empowered the Ethics Commission (Rhode Island) to adopt a code of ethics that included provisions on general assembly members' conflicts of interest and use of position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rhode Island Ethics Commission adopted a code of ethics, prohibiting members of the general assembly from serving as members of governmental public boards or commissions and from participating in the appointment process to those entities. Pursuant to a request by the governor, the court considered the constitutionality of the regulation and found that the commission was without authority under R.I. Const. art. III, &sect; 8 to adopt such a regulation. The court explained that in light of governmental history, the commission did not have the power to amend the constitutional framework of government, but instead was designed to deal with individual conduct and not governmental structure. The commission did not have the power to amend the constitutional framework of government by divesting the legislature of its appointive powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In answering the governor of Rhode Island's request for an opinion as to the constitutionality of a proposed regulation, the court found that the Ethics Commission did not have the power under the state constitution to restrict general assembly members' appointive power and, thus, did not have the power to adopt the conflicts of interest and use of position provision of the code of ethics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipal employee filed a petition in which he sought both declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant public officials.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">R. I. Gen. Law &sect; 44-18-30(30) (1956) was a state statute exempting bibles and other canonized religious scriptures from the state sales tax. Plaintiff retailers sued defendant tax administrator, claiming the law was unconstitutional. After the trial court found the statute unconstitutional under the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, defendant appealed. On appeal, the court noted that for a tax or an exemption like this one that targeted individual publications within the press, there was a heavy burden on the state to justify its action, and in its judgment, defendant failed to advance a compelling interest that could meet such a burden. The court affirmed finding of unconstitutionality because the statute violated the free press clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, a prohibition that U.S. Const. amend. XIV made applicable to the states. The court stated that plaintiffs had standing to assert constitutionality claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant filed a charge with defendant, Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, alleging that plaintiff, her employer, discriminated against her with respect to the terms and conditions of her employment. The defendant ruled in her favor, and plaintiff appealed the decision to the trial court. Unlike employees, plaintiff was unable to request the defendant's authorization to litigate employees' discrimination claims in superior court under the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-5-1 et seq. The trial court certified the question of whether employers have a constitutional right to a jury trial in connection with unlawful-employment-practice charges that are brought against them. The court held that FEPA's statutory scheme violated employers' rights to a jury trial, and answered the certified question in the affirmative. The court noted that an FEPA action triggered employers' rights to a jury trial and that, consequently, deprivation of that right to a jury trial was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' counterclaims for slander and abuse of process were denied as unripe, but not appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought to prevent defendants from foreclosing on liens attached to plaintiff's condominiums after defendants imposed fines for plaintiff's tenants' improper conduct and plaintiff refused to pay the fines. The court found that plaintiff waived the argument that his constitutionally protected contract rights were impaired by retroactive application of laws that allowed non-judicial foreclosure proceedings. While the complaint alleged violation of the alleged constitutional rights and a brief mention was made at opening and closing statement, there was no evidence presented and the issue of a constitutional contract right was not briefed on appeal. As plaintiff failed to present and litigate the issue, it was deemed waived. The court remanded the plaintiff's improper delegation of judicial authority or police power claim, which the superior court did not rule on. While plaintiff did not state the claim in the complaint, the issue was repeatedly raised at trial, plaintiff provided copies of three cases to the court to support the claim during closing argument, and defendants never once objected or attempted to exclude the issue. Plaintiff properly presented the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the superior court that denied plaintiff's claim of infringement of constitutional contract rights was affirmed because plaintiff waived the claim by failing to present and litigate it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After owner died, city sold her property for nonpayment of taxes to petitioner, a trust. The remaindermen, who had an interest in the property but were not notified of the sale, sold the property to respondents.

The trial court held that the notice statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-9-11 (1956), was unconstitutional and as a result the tax sale was invalid. The city appealed, claiming that the tax sale was valid. The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that &sect; 44-9-11 was unconstitutional because it did not provide sufficient notice to meet the requirements of due process. To satisfy due process, notice had to be reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of an action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. The remaindermen, who had a substantial interest in the property that was significantly affected by the tax sale, were readily identifiable from probate records.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipalities appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), in which the trial court declared R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 44-43-1 and 44-34-2, which permitted the variance of a motor vehicle tax according to plaintiffs' personal property tax rates, constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipalities brought an action, challenging the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 44-34-1 and 44-34-2. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that the statutes impermissibly provided for a motor vehicle tax that varied according to plaintiffs' personal property tax rate. The trial court entered a final judgment declaring the tax constitutional. Plaintiffs appealed, asserting that the statutes violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution and the Rhode Island Constitution because excise tax rates were required to be uniform throughout the state. The court affirmed the decision, concluding that the tax was a property tax and not an excise tax. The tax, which was based on a vehicle's value, was incidental to ownership. Further, although the nonpayment of the tax impeded registration of the vehicle, the tax was based on a vehicle's uniform value as determined by a statewide commission. The actual assessment of the tax was levied according to plaintiffs' particular tax rates and the collection of the property tax merely was aided by the fact that a delinquent taxpayer could not renew the vehicle's registration if the tax was not paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the statutes, which permitted the variance of a motor vehicle tax according to plaintiff municipalities' personal property tax rate, were constitutional where the tax computed upon the valuation of a motor vehicle was a property tax, rather than an excise tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hospital appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Providence County (Rhode Island), which concluded that patients' medical records were material to certain grand jury proceedings and that their need by respondent state outweighed patients' privacy interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state and the hospital contested whether notifying a patient that his medical records had been subpoenaed by a grand jury, under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-37.3-6.1, violated the grand jury secrecy requirements of R.I. Sup. Ct. R. Crim. P. 6(e). The issue concerned notification under &sect; 5-37.3-6.1. The court quashed the trial court's order that required production of the records, and held that notification did not implicate the provisions of Rule 6(e). Therefore, the grand jury was obligated to comply with &sect; 5-37.3-6.1, and to inform the parties of the issuance of a subpoena and their right to object. A balance was struck between patients' privacy interests and the state's interest in prohibiting illegal activity. However, the court found that the state had no authority to appoint agents to recover documents in furtherance of investigations that were not related to the grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the hospital's petition for a writ of certiorari, and quashed the order of the trial court, thus requiring the state to notify patients that their medical records had been subpoenaed by the grand jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sought termination of parental rights on the grounds that the parents had committed toward a child conduct of a cruel and abusive nature, the mother lacked the ability or the willingness for rehabilitation, and the father was unfit by reason of emotional illness. The mother's parental rights to her two older children were previously terminated because the mother had inflicted, or allowed to be inflicted, upon her children physical injury and sexual abuse and the children were without proper parental care and supervision. The mother argued that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-7-7(a) (1956) was unconstitutional because it allowed her rights to be terminated based on previous conduct towards a child, without an consideration of intervening circumstances. The court determined that &sect; 15-7-7(a) passed constitutional muster. Furthermore, the mother was given every opportunity to present evidence concerning her parental fitness. The court determined that the Department satisfied its burden of proof. Competent evidence supported the trial court's finding of unfitness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant manufacturing company appealed the order from the Superior Court of Providence County (Rhode Island), which entered partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Rhode Island Insurers' Insolvency Fund (Fund) in the Fund's action under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 27-34-11(b)(1) for reimbursement of payments to the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fund was established by the legislature to guarantee payments to an insured in the event an insurer became insolvent and was unable to discharge its obligations. In 1988 the legislature enacted &sect; 27-34-11(b)(1), which permitted the Fund to recover all amounts paid on behalf of an insured with a net worth in excess of $ 50 million. The Fund filed an action alleging that it made payments in excess of $ 1 million on the company's behalf and that the company had a net worth in excess of $ 50 million; thus, pursuant to &sect; 27-34-11(b)(1), the Fund demanded full recovery for the sums it had previously paid to the company as a result of an insurer's insolvency. The trial court granted the Fund partial summary judgment, finding that the recoupment provision did not violate the equal-protection clause. On appeal, the court affirmed the order, finding that &sect; 27-34-11(b)(1) satisfied the rational basis test because a $ 50 million net worth threshold was reasonable and rationally related to the public purpose of preserving the limited resources of the Fund. The court applied the rational basis test, as economic and social regulation was the classic area to apply a rational basis analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer included dividends from the stock of a foreign subsidiary as income on its federal tax return and received a credit against its federal income tax for the foreign taxes paid by its subsidiary. It paid its state income taxes without the benefit of a tax credit because, at that time, a tax credit was not available to a corporation receiving foreign dividend income. Such practice was subsequently declared unconstitutional. The taxpayer filed an amended tax return, claiming a refund of state income taxes. The division of taxation denied the request. The taxpayer decided to forego an administrative hearing and proceeded under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-1-11 (1956) to request a refund directly from the Treasurer. The Treasurer denied the request because no claim for a refund was pending with the division of taxation. The taxpayer sought a writ of mandamus, but the trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed. The taxpayer's failure to pursue its administrative remedies on a timely basis was fatal to its claim. In addition, the act that it sought to compel was not a ministerial duty but rather a matter appropriate for administrative review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, disabled police and firefighters, and defendant town appealed an order of the Superior Court, Kent County (Rhode Island) that entered judgment for the town in plaintiffs' action challenging the town's resolution that created a pension fund for disabled police and firefighters. The superior court vacated its entry of summary judgment that was in plaintiffs' favor when curative state legislation regarding the resolution was passed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs received two-thirds of their salary under the town's pension fund. Plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled to full active-duty pay under the Relief of Injured and Deceased Fire Fighters and Police Officers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45 (1956). Plaintiffs argued that the town's pension plan was technically invalid because it was passed by town council resolution, not ordinance. The general assembly enacted legislation purported to cure retroactively the alleged technical defect in the town's original resolution establishing the pension plan. Plaintiffs argued that the curative legislation violated the impairment-of-contracts clause in the federal and state constitutions. The court declined to rule on the legal effect or constitutionality of the curative act. It held that the initial resolution was recognized as valid for nearly 40 years, was properly enacted, and did not need special legislation to remedy its alleged infirmity. Although it was preferable to establish the plan using the formal procedures of enacting an ordinance, it was clear that the resolution was in substance and effect an ordinance. The court held that the plan was valid and denied both appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission was investigating various complaints, and the investigated persons sought access to discovery materials within the commission's possession that related to their cases. The request for discovery was denied because the commission did not permit review of files unless and until findings of probable cause were made. The investigated persons brought an action against the commission alleging that the commission's Regulation 1008(a) conflicted directly with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 36-14-12(c)(4), illegally abrogated their rights to discovery, infringed on their due process rights, and violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court rendered a judgment for the investigated persons, and granted a motion for attorney's fees brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court affirmed the decision. The court found that the commission waived its arguments except the argument under &sect; 1988. The court held that such fees were properly awarded because the investigated person was without question a prevailing party. The court noted that Regulation 1008(a) did conflict with R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 36-14-12(c)(4), and that the attorney general was timely served pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 4(1).</SPAN></P>

A police officer reported that defendant performed poorly on a field sobriety test, however, blood samples later taken pursuant to a warrant were negative for alcohol. The superior court certified to the court two questions: whether a blood-alcohol content of 0.10 percent was an essential element of the crimes described in &sect;&sect; 31.27.22 and 31-27-2, or whether the State could use other evidence that defendant was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and if other evidence was permissible, what standard established that defendant was &quot;under the influence.&quot; The court held that the clear language of the statutes permitted proof other than blood-alcohol content to establish that defendant was driving under the influence, and that for defendant to be convicted, the totality of all competent evidence had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the crime. The court noted that in making that determination, no distinction was to be drawn between circumstantial and direct evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant pleaded nolo contendere in state superior court to the narcotics-related charge. He received a four-year suspended sentence with supervised probation. While still on probation, the applicant was arrested on federal drug charges. He faced an enhanced sentence in federal court due to his prior state conviction, and before sentencing on the federal charge occurred, the applicant brought the action for post-conviction relief in the state court. The superior court denied the request. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the applicant was only required to be made aware of the direct consequences of his plea agreement in order for it to be considered valid. The impact of his state court conviction on the subsequent federal sentence in a separate proceeding was collateral because it was controlled by the federal criminal justice system, which operated beyond the direct authority of the state superior court judge. The state judge's admonition adequately addressed the relevant considerations. The state judge also did not err by failing to inform the applicant of the tax implications of his conviction or of the dismissal of the co-defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence with serious bodily injury resulting pursuant to &sect; 31-27-2.6. He filed a motion for a new trial on grounds that the admission of hospital medical records that revealed his post-collision blood alcohol level was improper as it violated the doctor-patient privilege and the Fourth Amendment. The motion was denied, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction and denial of the motion for a new trial. A grand jury had granted the police's request to subpoena the hospital records. Defendant had not consented to the release. Defendant alleged that when the police obtained the records, a Fourth Amendment search occurred, for which a warrant based on probable cause was required. The court held that the grand jury's involvement constituted state action. The constitutional protections, however, were not triggered. Defendant had no legitimate Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy in the hospital's medical records related to his emergency treatment following his near fatal automobile collision. The records were not privileged, and the grand jury system had not been abused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to suppress all inculpatory statements given by him to the police following his two arrests for larceny, that his confession was obtained pursuant to an invalid waiver of his Miranda rights, and that the trial court erred in making certain evidentiary rulings. Defendant contended that the police unnecessarily delayed his presentment to a judge following his arrests and thereby violated the command of R.I. Dist. Ct. R. Crim. P. 5(a). The delay between the arrests and present was 72 hours. Although the delays were undue, the court held that the delay did not have any causative effect on defendant's decision to incriminate himself. Defendant gave an oral confession within 30 minutes of his arrest. Furthermore, defendant had a prior record of 30 to 40 arrests and was fully aware of what was transpiring. The court determined that defendant had been advised of his Miranda rights prior to obtaining any incriminating statements and these statements were voluntary. Lastly, the court determined that the testimony elicited from defendant's girlfriend regarding other break-ins in which he was acquitted was proper to show a common scheme.</SPAN></P>

Both parties challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which awarded damages to the realtors on the grounds that the town had engaged in tortious interference with the realtors' prospective economic advantage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that (1) the actions of the town's officials demonstrated an obvious intent to interfere with the realtors' legitimate expectancy of developing their property under the regulations in effect when they filed their subdivision applications; (2) the conduct of the town's officials fulfilled the standard of egregious misconduct that barred the application of the public duty exception to the Governmental Tort Claims Act (Act); (3) because the town was engaged in a governmental function when it committed the tort, the trial justice properly limited the realtors' damages to $ 100,000 each, pursuant to &sect; 9-31-3 of the Act; (4) the realtors were denied their substantive and procedural due process rights because the pre-deprivation hearings were meaningless due to the actions of town officials; (5) the realtors were entitled to damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 because of the town's egregious conduct; and (6) because the statutory limitation on damages under the Act rendered inadequate the post-deprivation relief available to remedy the due process violations, the realtors could recover the full amount of their damages under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the town tortiously interfered with the realtors' prospective economic advantage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant were both nonprofit charities which offered informational literature to prospective donors. Defendant used donor-choice forms in fundraising activities and listed plaintiff's name without express permission. When its request to cease failed, plaintiff brought action seeking temporary and permanent injunctive relief. The court concluded there was a substantial likelihood of success on merits and preliminarily enjoined defendant from use of name and logo. Judgment affirmed. Evidence presented below supported a finding of likelihood of confusion caused by defendant's acts. Thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Plaintiff was threatened with irreparable injury to its good will, reputation, and unique identity requiring injunctive relief. Money damages were ineffective. The trial court acted within its discretion deciding threat was immediate. Defendant's allegation that injunction amounted to prior restraint of free speech was meritless. There was no speech interest involved in use of another's private property for solicitation purposes.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged that the violations occurred when defendant disclosed her prescription drug records to her husband's attorney without complying with a subpoena. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment to defendant, reversed denial of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, remanded for damages, and affirmed the trial justice's grant of summary judgment with respect to those claims that purported to state a violation of R.I.

Laws &sect; 11-47-52 (1956). The Superior Court of Kent County (Rhode Island) certified a question to the court to determine whether &sect; 11-47-52 (1956) was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clauses of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed that defendant smelled of alcohol, that his eyes were bloodshot and watery, and that his speech was slurred. During a pat-down search, officers retrieved a firearm. Defendant failed at least four field sobriety tests. Defendant contended that the phrases &quot;when intoxicated&quot; and &quot;under the influence&quot; failed to adequately warn what conduct was proscribed and that &sect; 11-47-52 was therefore vague. The court concluded that &sect; 11-47-52 reasonably informed defendant that his particular level of intoxication while carrying a firearm was proscribed. Moreover, the term &quot;intoxication&quot; had long been defined in the criminal context to comprehend a situation where, by reason of drinking intoxicants, an individual did not have the normal use of his physical or mental faculties, thus rendering him incapable of acting in a manner in which an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, in full possession of his faculties, using reasonable care, would act under like conditions. Law enforcement personnel, when enforcing &sect; 11-47-52, were guided by statutory requirements such as suspect notification procedures and sobriety tests that helped ensure consistent application of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the negative, finding that the statute, as applied to defendant, was not unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Providence County (Rhode Island) dismissed the wrongful death and unjust enrichment claims, but granted summary judgment for the victims and held defendant subject to the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the Act, like New York's Son of Sam law, was an unconstitutional restraint on free expression. The Act established a mechanism whereby profits that a criminally responsible person would otherwise have collected from the commercial exploitation of a felony were diverted to a criminal royalties fund from which victims of the crime could claim reimbursement for damages suffered as a result of the crime. The court reversed and held that the Act violated the First Amendment. The Act was a content-based statute, subject to strict scrutiny. The court acknowledged that the state had a compelling interest in depriving criminals of the profits of their crimes and in using the funds to compensate victims. However, the Act was not narrowly tailored to serve that compelling interest. The Act was overbroad because it affected all expressive activity and failed to limit its applicability to &quot;significant&quot; commercial exploitations. The court affirmed the dismissal of the victims' wrongful death claim as barred by the statute of limitations and the dismissal of their unjust enrichment claim as unsupported by the facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver, a Rhode Island resident, was involved in an automobile collision in Massachusetts which resulted in the death of another driver. He pled guilty in Massachusetts to a misdemeanor charge of &quot;negligent homicide by motor vehicle,&quot; under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 90, &sect; 24G(b). Based on such conviction, the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles suspended the driver's license for three years for having engaged in conduct that would have violated G.L. 1956 &sect; 31-27-1. The appeals panel reduced the suspension to one year, finding that the conviction in Massachusetts demonstrated no more than that the driver had committed ordinary negligence and therefore he could not be deemed guilty of the reckless disregard required under &sect; 31-27-1. The transcript from the driver's sentencing in Massachusetts included the prosecutor's statement that there was no evidence of drug or alcohol use, that the driver was not traveling at an excessive rate of speed, and that he may have fallen asleep at the wheel. The court held that the appeals panel could reasonably have concluded that these facts did not amount to the felony charge of driving to endanger, death resulting, under &sect; 31-27-1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered three certified questions from the Family Court (Rhode Island) concerning R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-7-7(1)(b)(iv) in a proceeding to terminate parental rights. Petitioner, the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), filed a petition to involuntarily terminate parental rights and respondent parents filed a motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents voluntarily agreed to terminate their rights to four of their children following allegations of abuse and/or neglect. On the basis of these voluntary terminations, the DCYF filed a petition to involuntarily terminate the parents' rights to their youngest child. The parents argued that the statute authorized the involuntary termination of parental rights on the basis of a former termination only when the former termination of rights was involuntary following a judicial finding of parental unfitness. The DCYF argued that the statute applied to all former terminations, whether voluntary or involuntary, and made no distinction between them. The court held that: (1) to have included voluntary terminations within the purview of &sect; 15-7-7(1)(b)(iv) belied legislative intent because state-sponsored rehabilitative services were neither contemplated nor required for the voluntary termination of parental rights; (2) the trial justice must have been convinced by clear and convincing evidence that the parents were either unfit or incapable of providing the child with the proper care; and (3) therefore, &sect; 15-7-7(1)(b)(iv) did not apply to the voluntary termination of parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the statutory provision permitting involuntary termination of parental rights on the basis of a former termination did not apply where the prior termination was voluntary.

</DIV>

The city asserted that if its application question violated a provision of the Fair Employment Practices Act, the officer had a right not to answer it. However, the officer was not permitted to submit a false and misleading employment application. The court agreed and consequently granted the petition for certiorari in part. Nevertheless, the error in dismissing the charges against the officer was harmless because the hearing committee rendered a correct decision on the merits of the case. The court found that the hearing committee's decision was fully supported by competent evidence, and thus affirmed that portion of the decision. The court upheld the determination that the officer had no obligation to report any of the alleged misconduct where there had been no arrest in one instance, and other offense were minor infractions that were not criminal offenses. Moreover, the omissions were harmless because city officials were aware of the officer's arrest record when they made the decision to employ him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retired professors (professors) initiated this action when the general assembly enacted a law that changed how much part-time state work they could engage before their pensions would be suspended. The trial court held that the statutory reemployment opportunities as they existed when the professors retired were contractual rights that could not be altered by the general assembly and applied to them without offending the contract clauses of both the federal and state constitutions. On appeal, the court reversed. The court determined that because the state was never obliged to offer post-retirement reemployment and the professors were never required to accept such reemployment, the professors had no contractual or other protected property right in being reemployed by the state after their retirement. Consequently, the professors were not entitled to complain when the state decided to change the terms of reemployment. Even if the professors had contractual rights, there was no evidence suggesting that the challenged amendments substantially impaired those rights. Furthermore, the challenged legislation was both reasonable and necessary to advance a legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents filed an action against defendant physician for the negligent performance of a sterilization procedure that resulted in a pregnancy and birth. The physician filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. The Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), certified two questions, asking whether such a cause of action existed and, if so, what was the measure of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court addressed an issue of first impression and joined the overwhelming majority of states that recognized a cause of action for negligent performance of sterilization procedures whether performed on the wife or on the husband. The court then considered the elements of damages allowed by other states and adopted a modification of the limited-recovery rule followed by the majority, under which parents could recover the medical expenses of the ineffective sterilization procedure, the medical and hospital costs of the pregnancy, the expense of a subsequent sterilization procedure, loss of wages, loss of consortium to the spouse arising out of the unwanted pregnancy, and medical expenses for prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care but, as modified, no recovery would be allowable for emotional distress arising out of the birth of a healthy child. The court further held that emotional distress could be recovered for a physically or mentally handicapped child and that if the physician had actual or implied notice of the likelihood of the probability of such a birth, the physician could be liable for the child-rearing costs and living expenses of the child for its life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the first question by stating that Rhode Island did recognize a tort for negligent performance of a sterilization procedure. The court answered the second question by adopting the limited recovery rule of damages, modified to exclude emotional distress for a healthy child but allowing substantial additional damages for the birth of a handicapped child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Family Court (Rhode Island) certified five questions of law to the court pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 8-10-43 and 9-24-27 and R.I. Dom. Rel. P. 72 regarding the constitutionality of Rhode Island's adoption statute and the jurisdiction of the family court. The questions arose in the adoption petition of plaintiff non-residents, the child's aunt and uncle, against defendant residents, the child's grandparents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of her death, the child's mother was a resident of Rhode Island. The father was also deceased. A state probate court appointed a temporary guardian for the child, granted physical custody to the non-residents, and granted visitation to the residents. The parties each filed petitions for adoption. A family court order was entered certifying questions to the court. As to the first question, the court held that, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 14-1-5(2) (1956), the family court had jurisdiction to hear the adoption petition even though the probate court had appointed a temporary guardian for the child. As to the second and fourth questions, the court held that the best interests of the child were served by permitting the family court to hear and consider the petition for adoption by the non-residents. The restrictions imposed on private placements by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 15-7-2 and 42-72.1-4 did not bar the private placement of a child with a close relative. The court limited such holding to the case at bar. The court did not address the third and fifth question, which involved substantive due process arguments, because it afforded the non-residents relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the family court's first, second, and fourth certified question and declined to address the third and fifth certified question. The case was then remanded to the family court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant inmates appealed an order of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, the Director of the Department of Corrections, in the inmates' action for post-conviction relief based upon their contention that the computation of good time and industrial time credits by the department, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-56-24 (1956) violated constitutional and statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department adopted a method for calculating good time credits which did not award credits for the time during which an inmate was subject to discipline, but instead, took credit away for that time. The inmates filed an action for post-conviction relief asserting that the department's procedure violated due process and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The trial court held that the APA was inapplicable to the department's adoption of a method for calculating credits. It then held that the correct method of calculation for good time and industrial time credits required the inmates to earn credits on a month-to-month basis, with a loss of one day of good time while subject to discipline. However, it allowed the inmates to accrue good time while subject to discipline. The court held that &sect; 42-56-24 granted the department discretion in awarding good time, and that the computation method was a matter of internal management, not subject to the APA. The court disagreed with the trial court's allowance of an accrual of good time credits while an inmate was subject to discipline, finding this to be at odds with the mandate of a subtraction of good time credits under &sect; 42-56-24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the inmates' appeal, affirmed the trial court's denial of their post-conviction relief, and reversed that portion of the trial court's order allowing the inmates to accrue good time while subject to discipline.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Rhode Island Depositors' Economic Protection Corporation (DEPCO) and defendant bank were ordered to show cause why the issues raised in a petition for certiorari filed by the DEPCO after the denial of its motion for summary judgment in the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), should not have been summarily decided. The DEPCO had brought suit against the bank demanding payment on a note.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEPCO had moved for summary judgment on its complaint in the trial court, and in opposition to the summary judgment motion, the bank claimed that the advances provided for in the loan agreement were intended to fund the construction of its real estate development and that the failure of the DEPCO to provide further funding after the bank went into receivership caused the bank to sustain damages. The bank asserted a failure of consideration and the equitable defense of recoupment. Convinced by the bank's assertions, the trial justice denied the motion for summary judgment, and the DEPCO filed a petition for certiorari to the court. The court granted the DEPCO's petition for certiorari and quashed the order of the trial court denying the DEPCO's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the trial court erred in denying summary judgment to the DEPCO, because the bank submitted a &quot;verified claim&quot; that asserted allegations regarding the obligations under the note, but never produced any evidence of an explicit written agreement that required the DEPCO to fund the real estate development fully, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-116-23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the DEPCO's petition for certiorari, quashed the order of the trial court, and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to enter summary judgment for the DEPCO.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, shopping mall owner and taxpayer, sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Providence County (Rhode Island) granting judgment for appellees, state, state government officials, and a developer, and dismissing appellants' complaint challenging the constitutionality of legislation authorizing the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation (EDC) and a municipality to enter into a tax-exempt agreement with a developer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed suit challenging the constitutionality of legislation authorizing the EDC and a municipality to enter into a long-term tax-exempt agreement with the developer of a proposed retail-shopping mall and parking garage. Appellants contended that the legislation violated the municipal voter-approval requirements of the home rule article under R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4, constituted an illegal pledge of the state's credit by the EDC, and improperly delegated tax-exempting legislative authority to the EDC. The court affirmed the superior court's order dismissing appellants' complaint and concluded that the home rule article did not require local voter approval of the legislation authorizing the agreement since the General Assembly retained its exclusive power, under R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5, to authorize municipal taxation and borrowing. As such, tax-enabling acts, like the one at issue, that affect a city's power to levy, assess and collect property taxes or to borrow money were not subject local voter approval. The court found that the challenged legislation did not authorize the EDC to pledge the credit of the state and did not improperly delegate legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer filed an action for damages against the city of Providence, its commissioner and treasurer and the police chief (city), alleging that they negligently failed to provide him, along with other officers at the riot scene, with blue shirts to make them less conspicuous and with riot gear. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court held that the Injured On Duty statute,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-19-1, did not preclude an officer from seeking recovery of damages, including the compensation for pain and suffering from a third party, but was the exclusive remedy for police officers injured in the line of duty with respect to their employers. The court held that the police officer could not have maintained an action in tort against a municipality and his superior officers for injuries sustained in the course of his employment. The court held that even if a negligence claim could have been established the city's negligence would have arguably constituted a remote cause of his injury as he was injured as a direct result of an intentional battery by an unknown assailant.

The statements, submitted to an executive body as well as to legislators, were made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and in connection with an issue of public concern, namely, potential environmental contamination resulting from the landfill activities. The resident presented detailed averments that her statements were based upon various scientific studies and reports, and the landowners submitted no opposing evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court partially sustained the corporation's appeal, partially denied the corporation's appeal, sustained the tax assessor's appeal, and remanded. The court held that the trial court properly concluded that the corporation did not comply with the requirements of account-filing law. The court determined that the trial court erroneously concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction as a consequence of the corporation's failure to comply with account-filing law requirements. The court held that the trial court properly determined that the corporation failed to toll the limitations period regarding tax-assessment dates. The court found that the tax assessor could carry over the same fair-market finding from one tax-assessment date to the next until it was required to conduct its decennial re-valuation. The court also determined that the trial court did not overlook material evidence. The court found that the corporation's degree of fault with respect to the deteriorating condition of taxable property was beyond the scope of the tax assessor's inquiry. Because the corporation did not demonstrate that an adequate remedy at law was unavailable, equitable relief was unavailable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his convictions by the Providence County Superior Court (Rhode Island) of one count of driving to endanger, death resulting; one count of driving under the influence, death resulting; four counts of driving to endanger, personal injury resulting; and four counts of driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting. Defendant contended, in part, that a blood-alcohol test was improperly admitted as evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol after an automobile accident in which he was injured. The occupants of the other car were either injured or killed. He refused a police request to take a blood alcohol test, although hospital personnel performed such a test to assess his injuries. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-27-2, which prohibited the admission of blood alcohol tests obtained without defendant's consent, did not bar admission of blood tests performed by private health care providers for the purpose of administering medical treatment. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction because testimony of the police, the victim and the observations of the admitting physician, taken together with the result of the blood-alcohol analysis, proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol when the accident occurred. The trial court properly denied admission of defendant's expert when that testimony was inadmissible hearsay. The court refused to review the sentence, as defendant had not filed a motion pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied and dismissed defendant's appeal and affirmed the judgment of the superior court, which convicted him of one count of driving to endanger, death resulting; one count of driving under the influence, death resulting; four counts of driving to endanger, personal injury resulting; and four counts of driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sold oil for use by the state electric company. All shipments were delivered via common carriers using barges or vessels. The contracts were negotiated and paid for in other states. The company had no employees or property in the state. The Rhode Island Division of Taxation issued a notice-of-deficiency determination regarding the fuel-oil deliveries made under the Gross-Earnings Tax Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-41-1 (1956). The company requested an administrative hearing. The tax administrator affirmed the assessment. The company appealed to the district court, which affirmed the assessment. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the company's activities created a physical presence within the state. The tax imposed was consistent with the commerce clause because it was applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to services, which the state provided to the company. The court also held that the company was an importer because it held title, risk of loss, and possession of the fuel oil at the time it was brought into the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress the fruits of the search performed by the police.

The court did not find, however, that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. The court determined that there was no evidence in the record which demonstrated any proof of prosecutorial misconduct that rose to the level sufficient to constitute a due process violation. The court found that the trial justice properly denied defendant's motions for judgment of acquittal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree sexual assault. Defendant contended that the trial judge erred in failing to grant a mistrial; (2) in permitting the state to cross-examine defendant about an uncharged incident of sexual abuse and permitting the victims to rebut that testimony; (3) in refusing to grant defendant access to one of the victim's psychotherapy records; and (4) admitting testimony regarding one of the victim's out-of-court statements. Defendant also asserted that the state violated R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1), (7) by failing to provide defendant with statements. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that posing a mere question about defendant's prior acts was not so prejudicial so as to warrant a mistrial. The court also determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing rebuttal testimony to impeach defendant's direct testimony and that the state did not violate Rule 16.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission found that the judge had violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canons 2B, 4C(3)(b)(i), 4C(3)(b)(iv), 4D(1)(a) and 3B(8), by improperly engaging in solicitations for charitable and other purposes. The trial court denied the judge's motions to compel the production of documents and answers to interrogatories, and for specification of charges. It denied the commission's motion to quash the subpoena for the deposition of a current commission member and granted the commission's request for a protective order limiting the scope of questioning of certain commission members. On writ of certiorari, the court held that the presumption of constitutionality prevailed as to the composition of the commission. The court also held that the judge was not unduly prejudiced and that the denial of his motions and the grant of a protective order limiting the scope of the depositions of the commission members were proper. The judge was not prohibited from taking the commission members' depositions on the grounds of absolute privilege, but was properly prohibited from discovering any information connected with communications among commission members or their service on the commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of stalking his estranged wife and violating a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting her. A one year sentence was imposed for defendant's stalking offense and another one year concurrent sentence was imposed for violating probation. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the stalking count on the basis that statute was facially vague and, therefore, unconstitutional. The state's appeal was sustained by the court, which vacated the contested order of dismissal. The case was remanded to reinstate the complaint and to continue proceedings based on the amended version of the statute. The court held that, although the original statute was ineptly drafted, it was not sufficiently ambiguous as to render it unconstitutional. The court afforded no weight to the legislature's amendment of the statute following the decision of the superior court and before this appeal occurred. The court followed foreign precedent construing a similar stalking statute. The court rejected as unreasonable defendant's interpretation of the statute to require that an individual repeatedly commit &quot;harassment,&quot; a word whose definition contemplated the occurrence of multiple acts.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had filed a personal injury action against the manufacturer after he was struck by a section of prefabricated roof decking manufactured by the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured while working on a job site. After the manufacturer filed bankruptcy, the trial court granted plaintiff's motion to substitute the insurer as a defendant. Plaintiff subsequently obtained relief in the bankruptcy court from the automatic stay. On appeal from the substitution order, the court affirmed. The court held that (1) R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 27-7-2.4 clearly and unambiguously allowed plaintiff to substitute the insurer as defendant after the manufacturer filed for bankruptcy; (2) plaintiff was not required to obtain a modification of the bankruptcy court's automatic stay in order to substitute the insurer as defendant; (3) relief from the automatic stay did not render substitution of the insurer unnecessary because the relief only authorized the trial court to determine the motion to substitute, it did not re-expose the manufacturer to a judgment of the trial court; and (4) the direct action was constitutional and &sect; 27-7-2.4 was not preempted by federal bankruptcy laws because allowing plaintiff, who was the only claimant, to proceed against the insurer did not impede the ability of the bankruptcy laws to protect the manufacturer's other creditors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser of a parcel of real estate, who sought to obtain an amendment to a zoning ordinance to allow for residential development of the parcel, brought an action for abuse of process and tortious interference with prospective contractual relations against the religious organization, which had unsuccessfully sought to purchase the parcel prior to its sale. The lower court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, and the purchaser appealed. The court held that issues of fact concerning whether certain actions taken by defendants were objectively baseless and utilized the process itself rather than the intended outcome in order to hinder and delay the purchaser in its attempt to develop the subject real estate precluded summary judgment.

The parties filed briefs pursuant to an order directing them to appear and show cause why the issues raised in the appeal should not have been summarily decided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed four tax-abatement petitions, challenging the property tax assessed by the City as excessive. The City argued that the taxpayer was precluded, as a matter of law, from pursuing its claim because it failed to file an account as required by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-5-15 (1956). The trial court granted the City's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the petitions. The parties having failed to show cause, the court summarily decided the issues raised on appeal, denying and dismissing the taxpayer's appeal and affirming the trial court's order. Summary judgment was properly granted to the City because, although the trial court always had subject matter jurisdiction to hear tax abatement claims, such jurisdiction was not properly invoked. By failing to file an account of the property pursuant to the statutory requirement, the taxpayer failed to satisfy a condition precedent to allow it to challenge the tax valuation on its merits. There was no excuse for such failure because the published notice of the tax assessment was sufficient. The ramifications of the failure to file an account were set forth in the taxing statutes and were not required to be set out in the notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment and dismissal of the taxpayer's petitions, and denied and dismissed the taxpayer's appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the manufacturer's motion to dismiss, holding that the amended complaint was not time-barred by &sect; 9-1-14(b). The manufacturer appealed. The court quashed the order and remanded the action to the court with directions. The statute of limitations was not tolled under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-1-20 because there was no showing that the manufacturer had tried to conceal the existence of the cause of action. Whether the injured party exercised reasonable diligence was irrelevant because the discovery rule concerned the discovery that one had suffered an injury, not the discovery of the responsible party's identity. R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 19(b) was inapplicable because the manufacturer was already a party to the action. The statute of limitations was not unconstitutional because the legislature had the power to enact reasonable limits on parties' rights to have their claims adjudicated by the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens challenged the state's system of financing public schools. The trial court found that the system developed by the general assembly violated the state constitution's education clause and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.

The court held that the general assembly was vested with broad plenary power, and legislation passed pursuant to that power was presumed constitutional and valid. The court further found that the education clause conferred no right or guarantee of receiving an equal, adequate, and meaningful education. The general assembly was solely vested with the responsibility of administering public education. Therefore, the trial court's interference with that right in the absence of constitutional infirmity was a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the retirement board of the city's Employees' Retirement System, filed suit against the city and claimed that the city's amendment was an attempt to amend the city's Home Rule Charter, which required a city-wide referendum. The trial court agreed and held that the changes in the investment power of the retirement board required a special city election. At issue was whether the city had the power to transfer from the retirement board to the board of investment commissioners the authority to invest the funds of the city's retirement system. The court held that, pursuant to the city's ordinance and in the exercise of the city's authority under &sect; 815 of the Home Rule charter, that the city had validly &quot;prescribed&quot; that the board of investment commissioners hold and invest the funds of the Employees' Retirement System. The court held that absent a specific charter prohibition barring the transfer of investment authority from the retirement board to the board of investment commissioners, the challenged ordinance was consistent with the charter. The court therefore held that the city's amendment was valid.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws. &sect; 11-10-1 (1981 Reenactment), the State moved to certify the issue of whether the criminal prosecution of an unmarried consenting heterosexual adult who engaged in cunnilingus was prohibited by the constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with committing, among other things, an abominable and detestable crime against nature, in violation of &sect; 11-10-1, after each man performed an act of cunnilingus upon a different exotic dancer during a bachelor party. After both defendants moved to dismiss the count of cunnilingus, the State filed a motion to certify the issue of whether &sect; 11-10-1 was unconstitutional as applied to unmarried consenting heterosexual adults. In its motion, the State noted that it was awaiting the court's review of another case involving a similar question. In their argument before the court, defendants agreed that the court's decision in the other case would be dispositive of the issues presented in their case. Upon deciding in the other case that the application of &sect; 11-10-1 did not implicate any fundamental rights involving family relationships, marriage, or procreation, the court answered the question certified in the negative. The court held that because an unmarried adult did not have a privacy right to engage in unnatural acts, defendants could be prosecuted for engaging in acts of cunnilingus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chief of police was readmitted to the collective bargaining unit of defendant local union. Plaintiff city objected because of his status. He contended that he was eligible because he was an employee under the bargaining agreement. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order, resulting from the city instituting a declaratory-judgment action seeking clarification of alleged conflicts among R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 28-9.2-3 and 28-9.2-5, advisory No. 9, and the Home Rule Article, Article 13 of the Rhode Island Constitution. The trial court certified specific questions. The court concluded given the varying degrees of power and responsibility chiefs of differing locales possess, it could not say that by including chiefs of police as members of local town and city police bargaining units, &sect;&sect; 28-9.2-3 and 28-9.2-5 per se violated article 3, &sect; 7. Further, sections &sect;&sect; 28-9.2-3 and 28-9.2-5 did not facially conflict with article 3, &sect; 7. The General Assembly's inclusion of chiefs of police in local bargaining units did not violate any provision of the Federal or State Constitutions. The court held the chief should not be excluded from the union on the basis of public policy.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 11-37-8.1 (1981), as amended by 1984 R.I. Pub. Laws 59, &sect; 2, Defendant asserted, in his appeal, that the trial court had failed to instruct the jury on the mens rea element of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was brought in for questioning after his young niece reported that he had sexually molested her. He was advised of his rights and eventually confessed to the crime. Defendant unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the charges; defendant's motion to suppress the confession was initially granted by the trial court, but the suppression order was reversed on appeal. Defendant was convicted and sought further review. He asserted that the trial court had erred in failing to instruct the jury that, before it could convict him, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's acts were for the purpose of his own sexual arousal or gratification. In reversing, the court held that &sect; 11-37-8.1 carried an implied intent requirement. Although it was not specifically stated in the statute, an implied mens rea requirement was part of &sect; 11-37-8.1; before defendant could be found guilty, the State was required to prove that had defendant acted with the intent of sexual arousal or gratification. Because the trial court had failed to instruct the jury as to this essential element of the crime, defendant's conviction had to be reversed. The confession was admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained defendant's appeal, reversed the judgment of conviction, and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, corporation and receiver, brought a negligence action against defendants, credit union officials, in the Superior Court (Rhode Island). Third-party defendant accounting firm, joined as a party, objected to a settlement of the case. The trial court certified to the court questions on the validity of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-116-40. The governor's office had similarly requested advisory opinions. The court consolidated the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was created by statute to resolve a crisis by liquidating and serving as receiver for insolvent credit unions. The statute was amended by &sect; 42-116-40, which provided that defendants making good faith settlements with the corporation or a receiver were not liable for contribution or indemnity, while such settlements did not discharge other joint tortfeasors. The questions asked were whether &sect; 42-116-40 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV or R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, constituted an unlawful bill of attainder under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, or impaired contracts in violation of R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court held that &sect; 42-116-40 comported with the requirements of equal protection under both the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The court held that &sect; 42-116-40 did not offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Rhode Island Constitution. The court held that &sect; 42-116-40 could not be construed as an unlawful bill of attainder, and determined that it was not a law impairing the obligation of contracts in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions. The court was of the opinion that &sect; 42-116-40 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court had upheld the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws. &sect; 44-11-11 (1956 (1980 Reenactment)).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice suit relating to prenatal and postnatal care, plaintiffs, mother and minor daughter, sought review of a summary judgment of the Superior County Court of Washington County (Rhode Island), in favor of defendant pediatrician, finding that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations as pronounced in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-1-14.1(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit against an obstetrician and others for negligence in providing prenatal and postnatal care. Years later, and over seven years after the alleged malpractice, plaintiffs amended their complaint to add claims against the pediatrician. The court affirmed the trial court judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claims against the pediatrician because they were time barred according to &sect; 9-1-14.1(a). Where suit had been brought, the statute of limitations barred adding new defendants three years after the occurrence of the incident that gave rise to the complaint. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional. A minor was not disadvantaged by age because suit could have been postponed until three years after reaching the age of majority. The court also granted the protective order requested by the pediatrician regarding discovery because plaintiffs had deposed the pediatrician once. The court found that conflicts between the testimony of the pediatrician and another witness could have been resolved at trial.</SPAN></P>

The patient and his wife's action against the State alleged that the State negligently and carelessly caused and permitted the third floor window to have been in a dangerous and unsafe condition. At the time of the injury, the Act limited the damages recoverable against the State. The house of representatives passed a bill that allowed the patient and his wife to institute an action against the State for damages in excess of the Act's limitation. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment after determining that the bill was a special act that violated equal protection. The court held that the legislature had the plenary power to appropriate public funds for private purposes provided the minimum voting requirements set forth in R.I. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The title holder filed a petition to foreclose a tax lien, alleging that a tax commission had sold the subject property for the nonpayment of taxes or fees, that he has purchased title to the property at the sale, and that a year had elapsed from the date of sale and no redemption had been made. The bank, which held a promissory note secured by a mortgage on the property, challenged the petition on the ground that it had no notice of the sale. The trial court denied the motion and entered judgment for the title holder. The bank subsequently filed a motion for relief from judgment on the ground that the order foreclosing its right of redemption was void because the statute under which the sale was allowed failed to require notice to mortgagees. The trial court granted the bank's motion and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The bank was entitled to relief from judgment because the statute required that notice of the impending sale be sent only to a resident taxpayer. Hence, the statute did not comport with constitutional guarantees of due process with regard to mortgagees, and, consequently, the sale was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the title holder's appeal and affirmed the order of the trial court dismissing judgment for the title holder because the bank, as a mortgagee, was not given notice of the tax sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner appealed from the order of the Superior Court. Providence County (Rhode Island) denying his motion to vacate or quash an ex parte writ of attachment obtained pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 10-5-5 (1985) by plaintiff bank. The property owner also appealed from the trial court's order granting compensation to a constable pursuant to &sect; 9-29-10 for keeping the attached property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank foreclosed on its mortgages on the property owner's real properties and obtained a deficiency judgment against him after the foreclosure sale of the properties. During the eviction for one of the properties, large numbers of gold coins, jewelry, and collectibles were discovered inside. The bank then obtained an ex parte writ of attachment for the personal property pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 10-5-5 (1985), and the trial court denied the property owner's motion to vacate or quash the writ. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court. The court ruled that &sect; 10-5-5 violated the property owner's procedural due process rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and R.I. Const. art.1, &sect; 2 because it failed to provide a pre-attachment hearing without requiring a showing of exigent circumstances. The court ruled that R.I. Gen.

The court also ruled that the trial court properly awarded a constable compensation for keeping the attached property pursuant to &sect; 9-29-10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff medical center brought an action against defendant patient to recover for medical services provided to her and her deceased husband. In a separate action, the medical center sought to set aside an alleged fraudulent conveyance of the patient's home to defendant daughters. The suits were consolidated and Superior Court of Providence County (Rhode Island) certified questions for consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified questions before the court concerned the patient's liability for her own and her husband's medical expenses, and the daughters' liability for the patient's medical expenses. The court first set aside the patient's conveyance of her home to her daughters, holding that it was a fraudulent attempt to avoid the debt to the medical center. The court then held that despite the patient's episodes of mental illness, there was no evidence that she was without capacity to contract for the services provided by the medical center. Further, she was liable under the theory of quasi-contract for medically necessary services for which she received a benefit. The patient was liable for her husband's expenses under the necessaries doctrine, which the court expanded to impose a burden for spousal necessities on the wife as well as the husband. The expansion was retroactively applied to the patient in the interests of equity. The court held that the daughters were liable for the patient's expenses only upon a finding of the trial court that the patient was unable to pay her debt and that the daughters were able to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the patient was liable for both her own and her husband's debts to the medical center. The court remanded the case for a factual determination of her ability to pay in light of the court's conclusion that the conveyance of her principal asset was null and void. With respect to the issue of the daughters' liability, the lower court had to determine if the daughters could pay the debt if the patient could not do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of drug-related offenses based on evidence seized form his apartment under a search warrant signed by a retired judge. On appeal, defendant alleged the superior court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence because the retired judge lacked authority to sign warrants. The court granted certiorari review and quashed the judgment of conviction because the retired judge lacked both statutory and de facto authority to issue the warrant. The 1969 Judicial Reorganization Act, 1969 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 239, &sect; 58, granted retired justices all the powers and authority of a district court judge only when so assigned and performing such service. The retired judge lacked authority under the statute because when he signed the warrant, he was not assigned and performing as a district court judge. The court refused to find de facto authority where the judge retired 17 years ago despite his good-faith intent to continue his commitment to public service.</SPAN></P>

The court addressed two of the governor's questions in full and a third question in part, even though it found that the governor had no present constitutional duty awaiting performance. The court exercised it discretion and waived the defect, except as noted, because the governor's ability to appoint qualified individuals to certain government positions was an instance in which the public and constitutional importance was paramount. Regarding the questions that were addressed the court advised that the &quot;revolving-door legislation,&quot; found in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 36-14-5(n), (o) (1990 Reenactment, as amended by 1992 R. I. Pub. Laws, ch. 436, &sect;1) and Ethics Commission Regulations 36-14-5006 and 36-14-5007, did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, or R.I.

The court held that the proposed actions did not run afoul of constitutional limitations on executive-branch action. A number of statutes provided the director of the DOT with authority to act as lessor and transferor of the property composing the airport system. The DOT had the authority to act as lessor and transferor of the real and personal property that made up the airport system, and RIAC, as a subsidiary of RIPA, possessed the authority to act as lessee and transferee of the property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DEM denied the corporation's license request because of its failure to prove that the surrounding ground water would be adequately protected. The hearing officer (HO) recommended denial because given the proposed site location and the unique interrelation of ground and surface water in the area, the site could not tolerate any contamination. He recommended that if the corporation presented evidence of a quality control/quality assurance plan (QC/QA) and a leachate analysis, the license should issue. The court rejected the corporation's argument that the acting director was bound by the HO's findings and that failure to follow these findings exactly rendered the decision null and void. The acting director accepted the HO's determinations about credibility but reviewed the evidence and made several other fact-findings. The leachate analysis, although not specifically required by the rules, was necessary to substantiate the corporation's claim that the liner would adequately protect the environment. However, the superior court should have remanded solely for the presentation of evidence on a QC/QA plan and a leachate analysis to allow the corporation to meet its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial the driver attempted to attach certain of the company's real estate. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island ruled that the driver was not entitled to pre-judgment attachment. The court reviewed the history of state's law on the subject and found that pre-judgment attachment was not available to tort claimants because, unlike contract claimants, amount of damages at issue was not known with any certainty prior to judgment. The court also ruled that the driver was not entitled to a temporary restraining order against transfer of the real estate by the company because there was no evidence that there was any risk that the company would transfer the property. The court also found that the driver had not demonstrated a likelihood that he would prevail on the merits of his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the driver was not entitled to a temporary restraining order and that Rhode Island law did not permit pre-judgment attachment of property in tort cases. Accordingly, the court denied the petition for certiorari and quashed the writ previously issued. The court affirmed the orders of the trial court and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land owners (owners) filed an action to force the town to repair a driftway that abutted their property. The town never formally abandoned the driftway under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-6-2. The town refused on the ground that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-5-1 required it to maintain highways but not driftways. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the owners' complaint. The doctrine of laches did not apply because the action sought to vindicate public rights. The town had a duty to maintain the driftway under 1822 R.I. Pub. Laws &sect; 3 the same has highways. The statute was never appealed and controlled. Amendments to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-6-5, which applied only to the town, and which permitted abandonment without notice or damages, was unconstitutional due to its 20 year retroactive application. Retroactive application violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The statute was not rationally related to its stated public purpose of avoiding financial calamity. The court held that the town owed the owners a duty to keep the driftway open and ordered the town to locate, mark, and repair the driftway so that it was passable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation maintained that the DEM improperly overturned the decision of its administrative hearing officer, who had concluded that the proposed alterations would not cause unnecessary or undesirable destruction of freshwater wetlands. The court agreed and quashed the superior court's judgment that affirmed the DEM's denial of the water-quality certificate and the application. The court found that the DEM's actions went awry of proper administrative procedures because the DEM's denials failed to rest upon sufficient evidentiary support to overcome the deference it had to accord the hearing officer's decision. The DEM director was required to give great deference to the hearing officer's findings and conclusions unless clearly wrong. The DEM's rationale had to be substantiated by more than mere philosophical differences with the hearing officer. An adequate rationale was one that relied on a previously articulated standard and was supported by substantial evidence in the record. The court concluded that the DEM's final decision did not set forth such a rationale and therefore exceeded its authority under the Freshwater Wetlands Act, R.I. Gen.

When the district court found that the FURL was constitutional and dismissed his lawsuit, the trucker petitioned for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa-based carrier challenged the constitutionality of the decal-fee requirement imposed on nonresident motor carriers and sought a refund of fees paid. His administrative and district court challenges were unsuccessful. On certiorari, the court affirmed the district court ruling. After rejecting the administrator's claim that the complaint was mooted by an intervening revision in the statute because the carrier's damage claim remained extant, the court affirmed the district court's denial of class action status, found no merit to the carrier's &sect; 1983 claim, and upheld the statute's constitutionality. Applying a four-part test under the Commerce Clause, the court found that the decal fee statute applied to activities with a substantial nexus with Rhode Island, that there was no showing of unfair apportionment, that it was not discriminatory, and that it was fairly related to services provided by the state. The court also noted that the requirement that the fee not be discriminatory did not necessarily require that all parties were treated exactly alike, rejected a claim of facial unconstitutionality, and held that the Privileges and Immunities Clause was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial the dog owner disputed the victim's contention that the property was not enclosed and that he had failed to post adequate warning signs of the presence of the dog in violation of R.I.

The trial court granted the motion on the victim's strict liability counts regarding an adequate enclosure and adequate warnings. In ruling on the directed verdict motion, the trial court sua sponte declared &sect; 4-13.1-2, as it existed prior to 1987, to be unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment. The court found that the question of whether an adequate enclosure existed was dependent on the credibility of witnesses, a question of fact that should have been submitted to the jury. Similarly, a question of fact existed, as to whether the dog owner breached his duty to warn, and the question should have been submitted to the jury. Consequently, a directed verdict for the dog owner was improper. The court noted that the trial court was not permitted to declare a statute unconstitutional when the constitutionality of the statute was not raised by either party.</SPAN></P>

The electric company filed a petition with the PUC for review of Ordinance 553 pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 39-1-30 (1956). The town sought a declaration that &sect; 39-1-30 (1956) was unconstitutional. The trial court declared Ordinance 553 unlawful.

The legislature declared that the PUC had exclusive power to regulate public utilities. The council's action was impermissibly one of statewide character. The specificity of the functions delegated to the PUC and the standards of &sect; 39-1-30 were sufficient to form a constitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the pedestrian argued that the trial court improperly ruled that the notice required under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-5-14 was a condition precedent that must be complied with before the pedestrian could bring her tort action against the city. The court found that R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 24, ch. 5 (1956) (Reenactment 1968) was not enacted to establish any distinct and separate remedy applicable to snow and ice cases but rather to restrict availability of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-15-8 in such cases. The court reasoned that the pedestrian adopted a very narrow interpretation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-5-14 regarding the notification that must be given to the city and held that &sect; 24-5-14 did not mandate that the claimant be the person who gives notice to the city. Despite the pedestrian's argument that the notice requirement in &sect; 24-5-14 was unconstitutional and therefore not a bar to her claim against the city, the court found that the city was afforded an opportunity to take remedial action before someone was injured after weather conditions had created a hazard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state interscholastic league appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which ruled in favor of plaintiff parents in the parents' complaint that sought to enjoin the league from denying their son the opportunity to participate as a member of his high school girls' field hockey team. The court ordered the parties to show cause as to why the issues should not have been summarily decided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In deciding in favor of the parents, the superior court applied the strict scrutiny level of review and concluded that the league had no compelling reason not to permit males to compete in female sports. The court vacated the injunction and remanded. The court first noted that there was sufficient state action involved in the regulation of interscholastic competition to warrant the court's further consideration. R.I. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, the state's equal protection/due process provision, was not the equivalent of an adoption of an Equal Rights Amendment, as was made clear by the legislative history. Nor did the gender classification involved warrant strict scrutiny. Instead, the better approach was to apply intermediate scrutiny, which was sufficient to uncover any impermissible motivations for gender classification. Boys and girls were not similarly situated as they entered athletic competition, and, therefore, some gender classifications might have been permissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to commit assault with intent to murder, and assault with intent to murder relating to an attack on another inmate at a maximum-security facility. Defendant appealed the convictions, arguing, inter alia, that the inclusion of two photos of him in a photo array for identification by the victim made the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive. The court affirmed the convictions and remanded, holing that the photo array was unnecessarily suggestive, but the victim had ample time to observe defendant at a close distance in the light of midday, and the array was presented to the victim when he still had a fresh recollection of those involved. The court found that the victim's independent out-of-court identification was reliable despite the suggestive photo array.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, wife and her husband, appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Washington County (Rhode Island), which prohibited the wife from entering the medical affidavits from out-of-state health care providers against respondent town, as allowed by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-19-27 (1956), on the claims of the wife and husband for the town's negligence. The wife was injured when she slipped and fell in a town parking lot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the motion in limine of the town and prohibited the admission of the out-of-state affidavits. The trial court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-19-27 (1956) was unconstitutional because the out-of-state affiants were not within the subpoena power of the trial court, and the town was denied its right to cross-examine the affiants. On appeal, the court granted the wife and husband's petition for certiorari and reversed the trial court's determination. The court concluded that &sect; 9-19-27 was constitutional and was consistent with the rationale underlying the state's rules of evidence and other evidentiary standards. The need for cross-examination in civil cases was recognized. The court held that &sect; 9-19-27 had not automatically allowed for the admission of out-of-state medical affidavits but required trial judges to balance and evaluate the necessity of the proffered evidence to the wife and husband, the potential burdens on the town, and the relevant weight of the evidence. Section 9-19-27 provided for the town to obtain all necessary information, and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-18-5 expressly allowed for cross-examination by deposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the trial court, holding that the state law allowing the admission of out-of-state medical affidavits, pursuant to the trial judge's discretion, was constitutional. The court remanded for the trial judge to balance the needs and burdens of the parties and determined whether admission of the affidavits would have unduly prejudiced the rights of the town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The justice filed a petition that requested that the court reject the commission's recommendation that it terminate the justice's pension benefits retroactive to the date of his retirement and order him to repay those pension payments previously made. The petition challenged the commission's authority to recommend termination of the pension that the justice was receiving pursuant to Rhode Island statute, and it contested the court's authority to terminate the pension. The court determined that its inherent power to supervise lower courts authorized it to terminate the justice's pension. Further, it noted that honorable service was a necessary prerequisite in all areas of public service and for the vesting of pension rights. Because the justice had failed to comply with that prerequisite by his commission of acts violative of both ethical-conduct standards and the public trust, he had forfeited his right to receive pension benefits from the state. Accordingly, the court denied the justice's request and ordered the termination of his pension benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, when words in a constitution were free from ambiguity, they were given their plain, ordinary, and accepted meaning. The court held that the term &quot;adopt,&quot; as used in the constitution, meant &quot;create,&quot; &quot;develop,&quot; and &quot;enact,&quot; as used in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-2(a) and R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-35-3(c). The court held that it was the intent of the framers of the constitution to empower the Commission with the authority to develop and enact code of substantive ethics laws. The court held that the Commission's law-making powers were limited to that of ethics and that the granting of such powers had not violated the separation of powers doctrine under R.I.

On appeal the court vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to inform the jury of the return of a no true bill by a grand jury in a prior incident accusing defendant of the same offense. The court stated that, prior to the introduction of evidence of a crime other than the one charged and on which defendant had already been tried and acquitted, the trial court had to allow evidence of the acquittal either by stipulation, by the parties' testimony, or by an instruction from the trial court. The court found that evidence of the prior acquittal, as it related to the crime charged, was highly probative of defendant's credibility. Because of the high probability of prejudice in the case caused by the cumulative effect of the evidence, the jury should have been apprised of the no true bill. The court held that introduction of the no true bill would have given defendant the opportunity to attack the credibility of the evidence and would have alleviated its cumulative effect.</SPAN></P>

The act sought to grant depositors a priority in payment over other unsecured creditors upon liquidation of certain financial institutions. The court determined that the act was constitutional, concluding that the act was properly enacted by a majority vote of the legislature under R.I.

The court also found that the statutory preferences were valid in that they did not constitute a taking of private property for public use without just compensation. Lastly, the count determined that the authority to issue and fund bonds under the act did not violate R.I.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An elector sought to vindicate a public right on behalf of all Providence citizens without the intervention of the Attorney General by challenging the mayor-elect's title to the office of mayor. The court held that the elector was barred on the basis of past precedent from obtaining leave to file an information in the nature of quo warranto. The court further held that its discretionary allowance of petitions in equity in the nature of quo warranto by private citizens without the intervention of the attorney general was limited solely to petitioners who sought to place themselves in the public office in dispute. Because the petitioners did not claim any right to the office of mayor, the court denied the petition in equity. The court held that the mayor-elect was not disqualified under R.I. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 or R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 13-6-2 (1981). The court also held that petitioners failed to follow state law in asserting their challenge to the mayor-elect's ability to be a candidate, and disallowed the challenge to the election board's decision as untimely and inapposite. The court noted that &sect; 13-6-2 required actual imprisonment and was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner filed an application with the board and requested a license to operate a &quot;white goods&quot; recycling facility that involved the reclamation of large household appliances such as refrigerators, stoves, air conditioners, and microwaves. The board denied the application, because a legal remonstrance existed pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-21-2(b), and 53.7 percent of the neighbors within the statutorily designated radius of 200 feet of the property in question objected to the landowner's application. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 5-21-2(b) was not unconstitutional, even though &sect; 5-21-1 that governed renewal and revocation of secondhand dealers' licenses, was. The court reasoned that no unconstrained legislative delegation was present in &sect; 5-21-2(b) because: (1) it was limited in scope; (2) it conferred the limited function of granting a license to the specific applicants after posted or published notice, with a public hearing, and upon the payment of a nominal licensing fee; and (3) the specificity of &sect; 5-21-2(b)'s language created inherent limitations on the authority of the board and ensured against the possibility of administrative abuse.</SPAN></P>

The union argued that the policy was improper and unauthorized in that it violated the union's collective-bargaining agreement. The superior court ruled that the Director could properly require officers to work involuntary overtime. On appeal, the Director asserted that the collective bargaining agreement was invalid because it conflicted with his statutory powers under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 42-56-10 (1988). The court affirmed the superior court's ruling. The court held that the collective bargaining agreement, with respect to involuntary mandatory overtime, was invalid because it was an improper attempt to contractually restrict the Director's statutory powers. The collective-bargaining agreement could not restrict the Director's statutory power to order mandatory involuntary overtime. Contracts entered into in contravention to a state statute were illegal.</SPAN></P>

The petition for certiorari with respect to a motion to intervene and a cease and desist order were denied and dismissed. The petition with respect to the regulation was granted. The court held that nowhere was there a finding by the CRMC that there was a reasonable probability of damage to the coastal environment by virtue of the landowners' proposed construction. The court found that because the CRMC failed to support its requirements with the requisite findings of fact, the administrative decision failed to comply with the Rhode Island Administrative Procedures Act.

The police officers filed suit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the Providence Retirement Act, 1923 Pub. Laws 489, as amended by 1968 Pub. Laws 146.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that enforcement would violate a settlement agreement between defendant city police department and an unrelated party; that enforcement would violate the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I.

The court granted the firefighters union's petition for certiorari. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to rule whether the passage of FEPA repealed, or otherwise made unenforceable, the Providence Retirement Act. The court ruled that notwithstanding R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-5-38, the police officers failed to state a valid FEPA claim because under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 43-3-26, the Providence Retirement Act was a special act, and FEPA was a general law. The trial court further erred in failing to rule on the legal question of whether the settlement agreement was invalid on the basis that it contravened the Providence Retirement Act. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to rule on the constitutionality of the Providence Retirement Act as against an Equal Protection Clause challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injury victim challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Newport County (Rhode Island), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, the alleged tortfeasors, the city councilmen, a city treasurer, and certain property owners, in an action by the victim seeking to recover damages for personal injuries she sustained as a result of an alleged breach of defendants' statutory duty to maintain a roadway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured while riding on a flat bed truck in the city. She made a written demand on the city for damages. Subsequently, the general assembly passed a special act authorizing suit against the city by the victim for damages and allowed her three years in which to bring an action. Later, a second act relating to the victim's claim against the city was introduced that extended notice requirements. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that both special acts violated the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that in instances where the legislation enacted affected only a single community, it was a matter of local concern and was required to be submitted to the voters of that community at an election. The two special acts affected the property, affairs, and government of the city. Where the legislation affected a single home-rule community, the general assembly's authority was limited by the terms of R.I. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4. Because the special acts both affected matters of local concern and were not submitted to the voters of the city, these acts were invalid and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shopping center in question was located in an area designated as a historic district. The associates sought a certificate of approval from the Commission so that they could erect a one-story building on a portion of the shopping center. The Commission denied their application. They then appealed the decision to the Board, which conducted a series of hearings. Prior to the Board's final vote, each Board member commented on the appeal and expressed his or her individual rationale for sustaining or denying the appeal. The Board voted four to one to deny the appeal. The court found that the majority of the Board had not agreed on any one reason for denial of the application. It then remanded the case to the Board for the preparation of a decision that contained findings of fact and conclusions of law. On remand, the Board again denied the associates' appeal from the Commission's decision. The court affirmed the Board's decision, by holding that the Board properly applied the considerations found in Newport, R.I., Ordinance ch. 1278, because it determined that the design of the proposed building would seriously impair the historic and/or architectural value of the surrounding area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives of the Rhode Island General Assembly forwarded a resolution to the court requesting that the court render a decision as to whether proposed legislation relating to the appointment of special prosecutors was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed legislation set forth an application procedure for the appointment by the chief justice of the supreme court. It also set forth special prosecutors to investigate and prosecute any crime involving specified public officials. The court differentiated the proposal from the federal Ethics in Government Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 49 et seq. that permitted the appointment of independent counsel, which was found constitutional. The court found that the proposal's transfer of nonjudicial administrative powers to the chief justice would interfere with the exercise of his inherent judicial powers in violation of R.I. Const. arts. V, X &sect; 1. The court held that the proposed legislation impermissibly threatened the institutional integrity and impartiality of the judicial branch of government and compromised its independence. The court also held that the proposed legislation unconstitutionally violated R.I. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12 by infringing upon the fundamental powers of the attorney general, a constitutional officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the proposed legislation, if enacted, would have transferred full prosecutorial authority vested in the state's attorney general to a special prosecutor selected by the judicial branch of government in violation of the state constitution. The court answered the question presented by the legislature in its resolution in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>

At separate bail hearings, the trial court ordered that defendants be held without bail pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-13-5.1. Defendants appealed this determination, arguing that &sect; 12-13-5.1 was unconstitutional. Defendants' cases were consolidated. On appeal, the court granted a writ of certiorari, even though defendants had been convicted and sentenced on their charges, because the question involved was of extreme public importance and was capable of repetition but evaded review. The court held that &sect; 12-13-5.1 was constitutional because it was constitutionally permissible to hold a defendant without bail in order to prevent danger to the community. Nevertheless, the statute was unconstitutional as applied to defendants because the trial court was not entitled to rely only on the statute in denying bail. The trial court failed to make adequate findings of fact and failed to mention the burden of proof. The court granted the petitions pro forma and remanded papers to the trial court with its decision endorsed thereon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had entrusted a conservator with the management of her property. The conservator had unsuccessfully attempted to sell the apartment house the owner owned, subject to a life estate in the owner's apartment. The caretaker, who had continued to work without being paid, expressed an interest in buying the apartment house. The owner and the conservator prepared and executed a deed to the caretaker. The consideration for the conveyance was the caretaker's past and future services. The probate court approved the transaction two days later. The court held that the superior court erred by setting aside the deed. The conservator was empowered to sell the property under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 33-15-32 (1956). The sale did not have to be a cash transaction; the probate court could, and did, authorize the conservator to accept the caretaker's services as consideration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town brought suit against the activists seeking a determination that that the town had authority to enact Barrington, R.I., Ordinance 86-6, an ordinance to regulate picketing within the town. The activists filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the town lacked the requisite authority. The district court denied the motion and certified the question to the court. The activists argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated their right to free speech. The court determined that the ordinance was a constitutionally valid time, place, and manner regulation of picketing. The court reasoned that no specific group was denied a forum or afforded preferential treatment as a consequence of the ordinance. The court further held that the ordinance advanced the significant governmental interest of protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home. Because the ordinance restricted picketing in front of, adjacent to, or with respect to any property used for residential purposes, the court held that it was narrowly tailored to serve only those interests that it sought to protect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Rhode Island Registry of Motor Vehicles, appealed by writ of certiorari from an order of the Sixth Division District Court (Rhode Island), which permanently enjoined the Registry from suspending the driver's license and registration of plaintiff driver on the basis of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-11-7(a)(2), as amended by 1984 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 196, &sect; 3. The district court held the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was involved in an automobile accident in which a person was injured. He appealed the suspension of his license by first requesting a post-suspension hearing pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-11-7(b). When the Registry upheld the suspension, he appealed to the district court, which permanently enjoined the Registry from suspending his license. In the Registry's first appeal, the court remanded the matter to allow the district court to specify the legal reasoning for its decision. On the subsequent appeal, the court agreed with the district court's reasoning that the statute was so vague it was facially unconstitutional. The statute failed to set forth any standard to be used in determining whether a license should be revoked. Factors dealing with the duration of the suspension did not provide guidance as to whether suspension was appropriate. The provision of a post-suspension hearing did not satisfy the requirements of due process. Balancing the driver's substantial interest in his license, the strong potential for an erroneous deprivation, and the state's interest in removing dangerous drivers, the court held that the driver's interest outweighed the state's interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the Registry's petition for certiorari and quashed the writ it had previously issued. The court remanded the record certified to it back to the district court.</SPAN></P>

An issue was presented by the trial court's refusal to allow defendant to impeach a witness by admission of a prior conviction of that witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was killed at a witness' residence from which guns were stolen. Evidence at trial included a second witness' testimony to the effect that he bought five rifles from defendant on the date of the murder and that defendant stated to the effect that he had to slash someone in connection with the rifles and that defendant made a throat-cutting gesticulation. A third witness testified as to his overhearing some of the conversation between defendant and the second witness. The court ruled that the refusal to allow impeachment of the third witness' credibility by admission of a prior conviction of that witness was not an abuse of discretion. Remoteness was the only basis on which the prior conviction could be prohibited as a tool of impeachment of the witness' credibility. General Laws 1956 (1985 Reenactment) &sect; 9-17-15 said that the witness was not incompetent on account of the prior conviction. The court found no abuse of discretion as the prior conviction was thirteen years old, and there was no intervening conviction except for a traffic offense, which was driving without a license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for a murder committed in the course of a robbery. On appeal, defendant argued that his initial arrest was made without probable cause and that items later seized from his automobile pursuant to a warrant were inadmissible as the fruits of the initial arrest. Defendant also challenged the trial court's denial of his motion in limine to exclude the testimony of a certain witness. Finally, defendant challenged the validity of his sentence and urged the appellate court to reduce his sentence life imprisonment. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The arresting officer had probable cause to arrest defendant because defendant was standing next to an automobile described in a police radio broadcast and defendant was disheveled and bleeding from a cut on his cheekbone. The denial of defendant's motion in limine was not significantly prejudicial, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged witness testimony.

Gen. Laws &sect; 44-11-16 (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax division recomputed petitioners' net worth as listed on their 1977 and 1978 consolidated corporate tax returns. The division included the indebtedness owing to 10 percent stockholders pursuant to R. I Gen. Laws &sect; 44-11-16 (1980) and Regulation Re: Net Worth II (a). The administrator upheld the division's recomputation of petitioners' taxes and the district court affirmed. The court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari and held that the regulation was enacted to pursuant to a proper legislative delegation and, thus, had the force and effect of law and enjoyed a presumption of validity. The court found that petitioners did not offer any support to rebut that presumption. The court rejected petitioners' contention that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-11-16(a)(5) did not apply to situations where the indebtedness was owed between and among subsidiaries and their parent corporation. The court determined that the statute plainly called for the inclusion in net worth of all indebtedness owing to 10 percent stockholders and did not particularize the form of the stockholder. The court concluded that a corporate stockholder fit squarely within the ambit of the statute and the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Rhode Island District Court certified questions of law regarding the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 12-13-23 (1981 Reenactment), as enacted by 1988 R.I. Pub. Laws 396, &sect; 1, which allowed trial courts to order bail-source hearings after bail had been or was about to be posted by a defendant. Specifically, certified question number 3 asked whether the statute unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof from the State to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a controlled substance, assault and battery, and malicious damage to public property. The district court set bail at $ 250,000 with surety and the State immediately requested a bail-source hearing pursuant to &sect; 12-13-23. The district court granted the motion and scheduled a hearing. At the hearing, defendant objected to the proceeding and asked the district court to declare &sect; 12-13-23&nbsp;unconstitutional. The district court certified questions of law regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 12-13-23. The court held that &sect; 12-13-23 was unconstitutional under R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 because it placed the burden of proof on defendant regarding the source of bail funds. However, the court noted that it did intend to suggest that the trial court was not permitted to inquire into the source of bail at the first phase of the bail hearing. Assuming that the setting of bail was discretionary and not required, the trial court might inquire into the source of bail funds in order to secure defendant's presence in court. The court merely disallowed a second inquiry into the source of bail funds that placed the burden of proof on defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the district court's certified question number 3 in the affirmative. Accordingly, the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The residents cross-appealed the trial court's ruling in favor of the town regarding the constitutionality of certain acts and ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents filed a complaint seeking to restrain and enjoin the town from expanding its sewer system. The residents challenged various acts and ordinances on the grounds that they were an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The trial court enjoined the town from expanding its sewer district but ruled in favor of the town regarding the constitutionality of the acts and ordinances. The town appealed and the residents cross-appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in enjoining the town from expanding its sewer district because the town's authority to regulate sewers was inherent in its home rule charter. The charter provided that the town could enact ordinances and had complete powers of legislation and administration in relation to its municipal functions. The charter specifically vested authority in the town and its department of public works to regulate sewers and drains, designating such activity a municipal function. The court held that, in light of its decision that the town charter provided inherent authority for the town to maintain and expand its sewer lines, it was unnecessary to determine the issues raised by the residents on cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of burglary, kidnapping, first degree child molestation sexual assault, and obstructing a police officer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the child's inability to testify at the pretrial hearing was evidence of her suffering unreasonable and unnecessary mental or emotional harm. This, coupled with expert testimony based on a reasonable medical certainty that the child would be unable to testify in defendant's presence, was a sufficient showing to allow her to testify by videotape. The court held that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-37-13.2 (1956) fell within an exception to the right to face-to-face confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI. Protecting child victims of sexual assault was an important public policy. An alternative method of taking and admitting the child's testimony was necessary in order to prosecute and thereby deter sexual assault against children. Because the child was terrified of defendant, the case could not have gone to trial unless her testimony was taken by videotape. The court ruled that &sect; 11-37-13.2 did not violate defendant's right of self-representation. The defendant's motion to represent himself was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner's vehicle was pulled over at a drunk driving roadblock, the police officer detected an odor of alcohol and requested that petitioner submit to a chemical test. Upon his refusal to submit, petitioner was charged under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-27-2.1 (1986), issued a summons, and released. Petitioner challenged the summons and requested a hearing before the Administrative Adjudication Division (AAD). The administrative law judge rejected petitioner's motion to suppress by finding the roadblock constitutional, sustained the charge, and ordered multiple sanctions. The AAD appellate panel denied petitioner's claim that the roadblock was unconstitutional. The district court reversed the AAD's finding by holding that police could not constitutionally erect roadblocks absent statutory authorization. On certiorari, the court affirmed. The court held that roadblocks or checkpoints that were established to apprehend persons violating the law against driving under the influence of intoxicating beverages or drugs operated without probable cause or reasonable suspicion and violated the state constitution. Roadblock seizures were not justified by any state control or discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and remanded. The trial court correctly upheld the order, except the penalty, in light of the statutory language and competent evidence presented. The definition of the term integrated facility was not facially vague, nor was it applied in a discriminatory fashion against the company. The application of the definition to the company resulted in reclassification of the company's facility from an integrated to a nonintegrated facility, which was subject to less stringent discharge limitations. The commission attempted to extend its power beyond the scope of the statute to endow itself with the power to levy civil fines. That power did not exist under the statute.</SPAN></P>

However, the employer did not discharge her at that time. At the end of the spring term, the employee was notified that her employment contract would not be renewed for the following year.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress, which was denied by the trial court, in which he claimed that he was unable to understand the Miranda warnings given to him. The court upheld the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress and noted that the state presented four expert witnesses, all who testified that defendant had the capacity to understand and read the constitutional warnings that were afforded to him by the investigating police before his interrogation. The court further ruled that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to sever the criminal charges against him because the crimes committed by defendant were sufficiently similar to establish a common scheme or plan by him. The court rejected defendant's claim that his motion for mistrial was denied because the prosecutor made no comments that were so inflammatory so as to justify a mistrial. The court also dismissed defendant's argument that the trial court improperly allowed two investigating police officers to testify that they heard defendant being given Miranda warnings because this was not hearsay and was only offered to prove that the warnings were in fact given.</SPAN></P>

The regulations required the performance of criminal background checks on the educators, including the use of fingerprinting, and they prohibited the employment by an operator of a preschool program of any person with &quot;disqualifying information&quot; appearing in their background check. The educators alleged, inter alia, that the regulations conflicted with the legislative scheme, exceeded the delegated authority of the commissioner, and were unconstitutional. The trial court denied their request for injunctive relief, and the court affirmed. The court held that the regulations were a valid exercise of delegated legislative authority in that they carried out the legislature's intent of ensuring the safety of young children from persons likely to have been left alone with the children.

Defendant and a tenant had a dispute about the amount of rent and the use of air conditioning units. Defendant broke into the tenant's space with an ax and made a threatening remark. The trial court convicted defendant of assault with a dangerous weapon and breaking and entering in the daytime. Defendant appealed. The court found that there was an actual present ability on the part of defendant to inflict harm on the tenant, as defendant was standing in close proximity to the tenant holding an ax in both of his hands. The court held that it was clear that the words and actions of defendant, taken together, created an extremely tense and potentially volatile situation during which a person in the tenant's situation may have been subjected to a reasonable apprehension of immediate injury. The court found that the trial justice committed no error in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect; 36-14-5 (1956), the council members were required to notify the Commission of their intent to pass an ordinance that directly affected the council members. The court found that the failure to notify the Commission created a situation in which the council members passed an ordinance that directly benefitted them and created a monetary interest in violation of R.I.

The trial court found that the employee had failed to meet her burden of making an initial showing that her speech was constitutionally protected. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of a directed verdict to the housing authority and held that the employee's speech was constitutionally protected. The court found that the trial judge's repeated references to the fact that the employee's father was the chairman of the board of commissioners indicated that he attached negative references in making his determination. The court also found that the employee's supervisor denied her request to file a grievance and threatened to fire her if she questioned his authority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was injured when she fell from the third floor of the college's dormitory, which had been constructed by the builders in 1971, through an open door and a screen to the ground below. When the student brought suit in 1985 against the builders for negligent design, the builders filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the statute of limitations found in &sect; 9-1-29 barred the student's suit. Section 9-1-29 provided a 10-year statute of limitations for negligence actions against builders. In affirming the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the builders, the court rejected the claim of the student and the college that the statute was unconstitutional.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decree entered by the trial court to terminate the parental rights of the parents. The court found that the agency had made reasonable efforts to reunite the family. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence certain health-care information relating to the mother. The privilege afforded the health-care provider or recipient under R.I. Gen.

Laws &sect; 28-33-1.1(i)(c) (1986) unconstitutional after plaintiff Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee contended that they violated the state Supreme Court's exclusive power to regulate the practice of law by creating employee assistants positions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The position of employee assistant was created to provide advice and assistance to employees preparing for informal conferences involving workers' compensation claims. The employee assistants were expected to have expertise equivalent to a claims analyst or adjuster. The trial court held that the duties of the employee assistants constituted the practice of law. On review, the court noted that the legislature had previously permitted many services that could have come within the definition of the practice of law, and that even attorneys consulted certified public accountants and tax specialists. The court asserted that without the employee assistants to represent workers for the limited purpose of the informal hearing for workers' compensation claims, employees would be confronted with the expense of an attorney when the employer did not choose to be represented by one, as the employer was required to pay for an attorney for an employee only when choosing to be represented himself. The court added one proviso that, if the employee was denied benefits, he could consult with an attorney at state expense in order to determine whether to appeal. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council allowed the dock to be moved two feet. However, the dock extended another few feet further. The owner contended that the error was de minimus, and Council issued a desist order. The dock was removed, but the pilings remained. The owner then sought approval for a dock &quot;as built.&quot; The owner built another dock without approval. While the approval proceedings were pending, the owner brought its civil action. The appellate court denied the petition. The owner could not contend that the composition of the Council was unconstitutional when it used the Council's own procedures. The owner could not use the civil proceeding as a way of getting around the administrative proceeding. Thus, the owner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. However, the superior court could have used its equitable powers to deny relief where a party violated a Council regulation and sought equitable relief. On the facts, there was no abuse of discretion in denying relief because the property owner had a remedy at law and was unlikely to prevail on the merits. Estoppel did not apply because that remedy was not available when the party asserting it committed the wrongful acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner sought certiorari review of a ruling of the Providence County Superior Court (Rhode Island), which sustained a decision of respondent Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), declaring an area leading to the water to be a public right-of-way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CRMC designated a portion of a parcel of land as a public right-of-way to the tidal waters of the state. It had been dedicated as such in 1915 to replace a right-of-way in a different location that was closed to the public. The landowner protested, arguing that the CRMC's action was judicial and, hence, unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the CRMC. The court affirmed on appeal. The court found that the CRMC was charged with making findings regarding the existence of public rights-of-way to tidal-water areas and designating them as such. This function was a fact-finding one, not a judicial one that could be enforced without resort to the courts. Thus, the CRMC acted within its authority as an administrative agency. Its action were merely quasi-judicial. The court further found that the record contained competent evidence that the passageway was used permissively by the public as a right-of-way until the parcel in question was obtained by the landowner's immediate predecessor in interest. Thus, dedication and public use had been shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for certiorari was denied and the writ previously issued was quashed. The judgment of the trial court upholding the CRMC was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, the municipal employees filed an action that sought a determination of their seniority rights under &sect; 30-21-3 for time served in the armed forces. After the filing in the first case, but prior to the filling of the second case, 1985 Pub. L. 181-64 was enacted that purported to repeal veterans' seniority rights under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 30-21-3. In the second case, the municipal employees sought to declare the public law unconstitutional. The superior court certified the question of the public law's constitutionality to the court. The court held that the public law repealed &sect; 30-21-3 in its entirety and extinguished all pending suits and remedies filed pursuant to that statute. The court concluded that the public law was justified by a rational legislative purpose and comported with the substantive due process requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment. The public law did not constitute a taking in violation of either R. I. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 or U.S. Const. amend. V because the seniority rights conferred on eligible veterans by R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 30-21-3 were merely gratuities or floating expectancies until actually received by the employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax administrator determined that the corporation improperly included the partnerships' factors in the apportionment equation. The corporation sought a refund. The trial court reversed the decision of the tax administrator and the tax administrator appealed. On appeal, the court denied and dismissed the petition for certiorari and remanded the matter to the trial court. The court held that it was inequitable for the tax administrator to have excluded the proportionate partnerships' payroll, receipt, and property factors from the apportionment equation that included the income derived from these partnerships. The inclusion of this income for apportionment purposes necessarily required that the payroll, property, and receipt factors that gave rise to it should have been included in the apportionment equation also. Otherwise, the net income was subject to an apportionment ratio that reflected only the corporation's in-state and everywhere business activity when, in fact, this income did not arise from the corporation's corporate business activity, but instead arose out of the partnerships' business activities that were not reflected in the apportionment ratio.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a condominium suffered a major fire, plaintiff owner did not begin reconstruction for more than a year. City officials denied permission to rebuild, citing a city ordinance barring reconstruction of burnt buildings more than a year after the fire. The trial court declared the ordinance unconstitutional. The city officials sought review. On appeal, the court held that the city officials did not have the authority to declare the ordinance unconstitutional, so the owner did not need to first exhaust administrative remedies before the case was heard in the trial court. The court also ruled that the ordinance was invalid and void since it restricted rights conveyed in legislation saving pre-existing uses, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-10 (1980). The court ruled that pre-existing or non-conforming uses were capable of being abandoned, but the passage of time alone was not sufficient evidence of abandonment. Because the ordinance terminated a partially destroyed nonconforming use where reconstruction was not started within a year of the fire, it was invalid and void since it restricted rights conveyed under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-10 (1980).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Superior Court, Providence County (Rhode Island), which convicted him of first-degree murder and assault with intent to murder. Defendant also sought a writ of certiorari to challenge the superior court's revocation-of-probation determination. The two cases were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the State was wrongfully permitted to call a witness although the State had failed to provide defendant with a copy of her statement and notice of its intention to call her until after trial had started. The court concluded that the determination that the State had acted with due diligence and in good faith in its investigation of the witness and that no R.I. Super. R. Crim. P. 16 violation had occurred was not clearly erroneous. The witness's statement had no bearing on the defense of diminished capacity because it involved the ingestion of drugs after the murder and assault were committed. The court also found no error in refusing to identify an informant who had not taken an active role in the commission of the crimes. There was no variance between defendant's indictment and the proof at trial. The fact that defendant's indictment referred to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-23-1 and stated that he &quot;did murder&quot; was constitutionally sufficient to give notice of a pending charge for first-degree murder based on a premeditation theory. The court then found no abuse of discretion in the violation of probation proceedings and denied the petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, denied and dismissed defendant's appeal, and remanded the matter to the superior court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner scrap dealer sought certiorari in response to defendant city council's denial of the dealer's license-renewal application, arguing that the enabling legislation of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-21-1 (1956) (1976 Reenactment) , which permitted the town to license auto-salvage operations, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in that it allowed the town council unlimited discretion to renew or revoke licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer had a metal shredding operation. In response to complaints, the council imposed several restrictions on the operation of the business. The dealer spent approximately several thousand dollars bringing its operation into conformity with the restrictions. Subsequently the council voted not to renew the license. The dealer petitioned for certiorari. The court granted the petition and quashed the council's judgment, holding that &sect; 5-21-1 articulated no legislative purpose and set forth no primary standard to carry out the policy, nor did it establish an intelligent principle to guide the council. Section 5-21-1 simply left the question of license renewal and revocation to the pleasure of the council. As such it constituted an impermissible delegation of power by the legislature in contravention of R. I. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. Further, while the court had decided several cases involving the statute, it had never been asked to decide the statute's constitutionality prior to the dealer's petition. Merely because the court had recognized and applied the statute over an extended period did not suggest that a constitutionally based challenge to its validity was not in order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for certiorari and quashed the judgment of the council. The papers of the case were remanded to the council with the court's decision endorsed thereon.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also denied the DOT's motion to withdraw admissions entered under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 36.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor had performed several highway and bridge construction projects for the DOT and had never been fully paid. After the matters were not been resolved by the DOT claims board, the legislature enacted special legislation allowing the contractor to bring a civil action. During protracted litigation proceedings, the contractor filed requests for admissions that the DOT failed to answer and the matters were deemed admitted. The trial court denied the DOT's attempts to withdraw the admissions and eventually entered partial summary judgment for the contractor, based in part on the admitted evidence. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the DOT had not demonstrated that the motion to withdraw the admissions should have been granted when the DOT had not shown that they had acted diligently, that the admissions suppressed the truth, or that the withdrawal could have been made without prejudice to the contractor. The court held that the special legislation that authorized the litigation also authorized summary judgment. The special legislation did not offend R.I.

The patient commenced the instant action against the original doctor alleging negligent diagnosis, res ipsa loquitur, and lack of informed consent. The trial court directed a verdict for the doctor.

The two doctors had employment contracts with the corporation. The doctors were not partners at any time during which they treated the patient. Therefore, the liabilities of the doctors were several, and the mandatory joinder requirements of R.I. Super Ct. R. Civ. P. 19 did not apply to them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island requested an advisory opinion as to the constitutionality of proposed legislation, which provided that no license could be issued, transferred, or assigned to a business corporation whose stock was publicly traded, but allowed those who owned or operated a health care facility on the effective date of the act to continue to own or operate the facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued an advisory opinion declaring that proposed legislation that would prohibit a publicly traded business corporation from holding a license to own or operate a health care facility did not violate the 14th Amendment. It found that any attack against the legislation by a publicly traded corporation on the ground that the legislation violated the privileges or immunities clause would fail as corporations were not citizens within the meaning of that clause. Further, the due process clause would not be violated if, as suggested by amici curiae, the legislative aim was to avert the apparent decline of available health care to poor people, as that objective was solidly within the police power of the state and thus legitimate. In addition, limiting the licensing of publicly traded health-care facilities was an acceptable and rational means to achieve that objective. Finally, the proposed legislation did not violate the equal protection clause as it impinged on no fundamental rights, did not appear to intentionally discriminate against a suspect classification, nor did it discriminate against any group traditionally disfavored by the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the proposed legislation that would prohibit a publicly traded business corporation from holding a license to own or operate a health care facility did not violate the 14th Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff banking corporation filed a petition for writ of certiorari from the District Court, 6th Division (Rhode Island). The corporation sought a review of the district court's determination that upheld defendant tax administrator's decision denying the corporation's application for a tax refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 44-14-3 levied a tax upon all banking institutions organized under Rhode Island law at the rate of eight percent on the institutions' net income from any source. The banking corporation sought a refund of taxes it had paid under &sect; 44-14-3 based upon a claim that the tax was unconstitutional. The court denied the corporation's petition for writ of certiorari from the judgment that denied the corporation's application for a refund. There was no question that the corporation, domiciled in Rhode Island, had the necessary nexus with that state for it to impose a net income tax because of the extensive privileges afforded to the corporation by the state. The tax did not violate either the due process clause or the commerce clause because it did not discriminate against interstate commerce when it applied to all banking companies that were domiciled in the state regardless of whether they engaged in interstate or purely intrastate activities. The risk of multiple taxation was low because the corporation could deduct the taxes paid to other states in calculating the tax due Rhode Island. Finally, the tax related to the services provided by the state to the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied and dismissed the corporation's petition for writ of certiorari, quashed the writ that was issued, and remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the court's holding that a banking tax imposed upon the corporation's net income from whatever source and where ever located did not violate either the due process clause or the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realty corporation sought to rezone its property, which required an amendment to the local zoning ordinance. The superior court reversed the town council's denial of the amendment based on equity jurisdiction and its finding that the denial was arbitrary and capricious. On appeal, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and quashed the superior court's order because the superior court lacked jurisdiction to review the town council's refusal to amend the zoning ordinance. The trial justice erred as a matter of law in determining that the superior court's equity jurisdiction to review an enacted amendment extended to review of a town council's decision to not enact an amendment. Although the realty corporation did not have an equitable remedy, it had an administrative remedy in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 45-24-19(c), which authorized the granting of a variance. Despite its difficult burden of proof, a variance was a feasible way to challenge the validity of the application of a zoning ordinance to a particular property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's liquor license was suspended by the board for violating two conditions of his liquor license pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-5-1 (1956, Reenactment 1976). He appealed to the administrator, who reaffirmed the suspensions. The owner then filed a complaint for review of the administrator's decision. The trial court found that the power legislatively conferred under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-5-21, which allowed the board to impose conditions on a liquor license, was unconditional and invalid. On appeal, the court granted defendants' petition. By enacting &sect; 3-5-21, the legislature intended in conferring the power to revoke or suspend to implicitly authorize defendants to attach conditions to the issuance of liquor licenses. In order to effectuate the legislative intent behind &sect; 3-5-21, it was construed to imply that defendants had the authority to impose conditions upon the issuance of a license. The language of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-1-5 constituted a sufficient limitation upon the authority of defendants under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 3-5-21 to attach conditions to a liquor license and therefore &sect; 3-5-21 was not void. The conditions placed on the license were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction because based on a statutory amendment, the issue was no longer whether defendant was intoxicated or whether he was under the influence of liquor or whether his driving ability was impaired in any fashion. Therefore, the jury was properly instructed on the charged offense. The amendment simply removed the necessity of providing an expert at each trial to testify about the effect of that percentage of alcohol upon defendant's ability to drive. The court also found that the admission of the medical records was proper because there was no arrest and the records were the results of actions taken by hospital personnel rather than those taken under the supervision of some law-enforcement agency.</SPAN></P>

The court granted dismissal in favor of the juvenile, and the state appealed. The court reversed and held that the language of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-25-22 (1956), proscribing that any person who violated R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 11-25-22 was guilty of a misdemeanor, was clear and unambiguous and did not contradict an evident legislative purpose. Furthermore, the court ruled that all escapees, whether juvenile or adults, fell within the purview of &sect; 11-25-22.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, individuals and civil rights organization, filed discrimination charges against the state police. The state police requested a right to sue letter pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 28-5-24.1 (1979 Reenactment). The right to sue letter was issued and the human rights commission closed its investigation. The state police did not file suit within 90 days as required by &sect; 28-5-24.1, and the commission notified the parties that it was reopening its investigation. The trial court held that the human rights commission could reopen its investigation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 28-5-24.1 permitted the human rights commission to retain jurisdiction over a case in which a notice of right to sue was granted, but an action was not commenced by the requesting party within the 90 day limitations period set forth in the statute. The court interpreted the statute and held that it allowed the human rights commission to reopen its investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the leaders of each house of the Rhode Island General Assembly and the Governor of Rhode Island, sought an advisory opinion as to whether a joint resolution for vacating a particular judgeship could be acted upon if the General Assembly session was reconvened in light of R.I. Const. art. X, &sect; 4, which required that such a resolution should not be entertained at any other than the annual session for the election of public officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the General Assembly passed a joint resolution to vacate a particular judgeship in response to charges of judicial misconduct. The court agreed to render an advisory opinion, although the request was procedurally deficient, because only the leaders of each house and the governor tendered the question. The court held that the General Assembly did not have the power to remove a justice of the Supreme Court by a joint resolution declaring the office vacant, in light of the provisions of R.I. Const. art. X, &sect; 4. This provision stated that such a resolution should not be entertained at any other than the annual session of the election of public officers. The court found that this annual session had been eliminated and, thus, the legislative power to remove a Supreme Court justice was extinguished. In addition, the court held that the joint resolution was violative of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 prohibition against bills of attainder. The court found that this joint resolution constituted a bill of attainder because it was a response to the charges of judicial misconduct, and it penalized the judge without granting him an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the advisory opinion in the negative and held that a joint resolution for vacating a particular judgeship could not be acted upon at the reconvening of the General Assembly because the legislature no longer retained the power to remove a Supreme Court justice, and the resolution constituted a prohibitive bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the children were in foster care, a caseworker filed a complaint that alleged that they had been sexually abused by their natural father prior to being placed in foster care. During the placement hearing, the family court heard the testimony of expert witnesses and held an in-camera interview with the older child. The attorneys for both parties were at the interview until the child began crying. The trial judge then cleared the chambers and continued questioning the child. The judge did not allow cross-examination but upon completion of the questioning the stenographic record was read back for the attorneys, so that they could formulate followup questions for the trial justice to put to the child. On appeal, the father argued that the procedure of interviewing the child without affording him the right of confrontation, failed to accord him his constitutional right to due process of the law. The court affirmed and held that the best interest of the child as weighed against the interests of the parent and the state supported use of this type of procedure and was within the discretion of the trial justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the father's appeal, affirmed the action of the family court and remanded the case to the family court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's head-on collision with another automobile caused the deaths of two people in that car. The attending physician refused to draw a blood sample because defendant had not signed a release, whereupon defendant was reread her Miranda rights, signed a medical release form, and a blood sample was taken that showed her blood-alcohol level to have been above the legal limit. Furthermore, the passenger in defendant's car at the time of the accident informed police that the hood of the car was tied down rather than securely fastened, and photographs confirmed that an electrical cord tied the hood to the frame of the car. Defendant was convicted on two counts of driving to endanger, death resulted, pursuant to &sect; 31-27-1. The court affirmed on appeal. The court construed &sect; 31-27-1 to include the consent safeguards provided under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 31-27-2 (1982), which made blood-alcohol content admissible in driving under the influence cases, therefore the release of defendant's blood-test results fell under an exception of the Confidentiality of Health Care Information Act, 1978 R.I.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the motorcyclist and owner had obtained the driver's records, indicating that he suffered from diminished vision in his right eye and a loss of foot function, the Act became effective and the driver filed a motion in limine to suppress his medical information. Upon the objection and offer of proof made by the motorcyclist and owner, the trial court certified questions as to the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 5-37.3-6; 5-37.3-4(b)(11), (c); 5-37.3-8 pursuant to litigants' rights to justice, the legislature's intrusion on the judiciary's functioning, and violations of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In answering two of the certified questions affirmatively, the court declared the Act unconstitutional and declined to consider the other five questions. In so declaring, the court held that &sect; 5-37.3-6 violated the requirement of a separation of powers mandated by R.I. Const. art. 3; that it interfered with the judiciary's subpoena power, removing from a court's discretion the determination of the admissibility of otherwise relevant evidence and vesting it in the hands of individual patients; and that it prevented litigants from effectively presenting their claims.</SPAN></P>

The salvage company challenged the council's decision that the application should be treated as a new application under R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An automobile junkyard ceased activities at its location and the salvage company, which held a second mortgage on the property, acquired it at foreclosure sale. The salvage company applied for an auto wrecker's license at the location. The council treated the application as a new application under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 5-21-2(b) (1956) because the salvage company had never previously held an automobile junkyard license for these premises. The town council determined that the application should be treated as a new application, in part because operations at the site had ceased before the new application was filed. On appeal the court held that there was ample evidence upon which the council could find that the application of the salvage company was not a renewal but an application for a new license by a completely separate corporate entity, and as such it was subject to the provision of &sect; 5-21-2. The court also denied the salvage company's references to the unconstitutionality of &sect; 5-21-2, holding that the salvage company failed to satisfy its burden of persuasion by failing to cite an authoritative basis for its contention.</SPAN></P>

The court had &quot;little difficulty&quot; in finding that the asserted governmental interests were substantial. The court did not find it unreasonable for the state to believe that price advertising would have resulted in increased sales of alcoholic beverages generally.

The court determined that, because the state's interest in reducing the consumption of liquor was directly advanced by the restriction on liquor price advertising, there was no reason to undertake a similar analysis with respect to the state's interest in controlling the traffic in alcoholic beverages. The court found that the store had not demonstrated that uncontrolled advertising of the price of liquor posed no threat to the legislative goal of alcoholic moderation or abstinence. The court held that &sect; 3-8-7 was not more extensive than necessary to serve the enunciated governmental interests and, thus, did not violate the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

The city sought an injunction, and the superior court dismissed the action on the ground that &sect; 5.14.2 was so vague and indefinite as to violate due process and on the ground that there were appeals pending from two criminal actions involving the same property and the same issues. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the action because &sect; 5.14.2 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the ordinance plainly stated that no vehicle that had the capability to carry more than two tons of material in its cargo area was to be parked, stored, or garaged in a residential area. The court held that two totally separate proceedings were contemplated by the legislature when it enacted R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction, a trial court (Rhode Island) sealed the discovery obtained in the case pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 16. Defendant media filed motions for leave to intervene and to vacate the order that sealed the discovery. The trial court granted the motion for leave to intervene but denied the motion to vacate. Defendant and the media's petitions for certiorari were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a mayor of a city who was indicted for various crimes and who pleaded nolo contendere to one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault. The media intervened and sought the discovery that was obtained in the case. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, even though the issue was moot, because the resolution of the question was in the public interest. The court held that the trial court erred when it sealed the discovery because its inquiry and blanket statement of a potential prejudice was not sufficient to demonstrate compelling reasons for sealing the discovery documents. The court held that the trial court erred when it granted the motion to intervene because such a procedural device was inapplicable in a criminal proceeding. No private entity had a substantial interest in the actual subject matter of a criminal prosecution and no private entity was bound by any judgment of conviction. The court held that the proper procedure was to file a declaratory judgment action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, R.I Gen. Laws tit. 9, ch. 30 (1996 reenactment).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petitions of the media, the order that sealed the records was quashed, and the case was remanded to the trial court to determine if the protective order sought by defendant was narrowly tailored, if it was the only reasonable alternative, and what portions of the discovery were not sensitive. The court granted defendant's petition pro forma and the papers in that case were remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured passenger filed an action against the owners and operators of the cars involved in the collision, the bridge authority, and, by amended complaint, the architectural firm that designed the bridge.

The court denied the motion to dismiss the petition for certiorari. On appeal, the court quashed the order to strike and remanded to the trial court. The court concluded that the language of &sect; 9-1-29 applied to the bridge and did not violate R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 5.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband sought review of the interlocutory judgment of the Family Court (Rhode Island), which granted a divorce, ordered the husband to reconvey his interest in the marital home to the wife, and to pay certain alimony and counsel fees to the wife, and which restrained the husband from dealing with the funds in his retirement account or the value of his seat on the cotton exchange until he completed a wage assignment form.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for divorce, the family court entered an interlocutory judgment requiring the husband to reconvey his interest in the marital home to the wife, to pay certain alimony and counsel fees, and restraining him from interfering with certain assets. The court affirmed the orders, holding that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to support the trial justice's determination that the husband fraudulently transferred his interest in the marital home to satisfy a separate judgment against him, noting that the transfer happened during the pendency of the trial; (2) the trial justice considered the disparity between the wife's earning capacity and the husband's financial status in awarding alimony under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-5-16 (1956) (amended 1981) but that earnings were just one factor to be considered; (3) there was no evidence that the award of counsel fees was punitive, and that such award was within the family court's discretion; and (4) the orders were not an unconstitutional taking because of the safeguard in R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-5-24(b) providing for a hearing, and that the orders did not violate equal protection because they treated husbands and wives, as obligors, alike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of judgments of the Superior Court (Rhode Island), which dismissed all 66 counts of an indictment returned against defendants on the grounds that four of the counts violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and that the remaining counts had been brought after unnecessary delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged defendants with larcenies, briberies, three substantive violations of the Rhode Island Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and one count of conspiracy to violate RICO. The RICO-related counts were dismissed because the alleged violative acts occurred before the effective date of the statute and the remaining counts were dismissed because the state should have sought severance while the ex post facto motion was awaiting disposition. The court vacated the dismissals because one alleged act of bribery occurred after RICO became effective and it was sufficient to satisfy the definition of racketeering activity found in RICO, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 7-15-1 (1956). The conspiracy count also properly alleged the continuation of the conspiracy until well after the effective date of the RICO statute. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the state's failure to seek severance constituted unnecessary delay because the RICO counts were inextricably intertwined with the other counts and severance would have been inconvenient and expensive.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 24-1-1 through 24-1-15, whether the City's charter permitted it to condemn property for redevelopment, and whether the City complied with the Rhode Island Constitution in passing a redevelopment resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City developed an urban renewal plan. To effectuate the plan, the City's council, pursuant to the City's charter, passed an ordinance authorizing the City to acquire a portion of the landowner's property. After the ordinance was passed, the City initiated condemnation proceedings against the landowner. After the landowner's property was taken by the City, the City planned to sell it to a private developer. The City then brought a second condemnation action against the landowner to acquire an eight-foot area in the front of the landowner's property. The landowner filed an action in the U.S. District Court alleging the City's council's actions in passing the resolutions and authorizing the condemnation actions violated the U.S. and the Rhode Island Constitutions. The U.S. District Court certified questions regarding the constitutionality of the City's charter's provisions and the court found that the council acted properly in following the eminent domain procedure provided by the general laws rather than the charter, that the charter was not unconstitutionally overbroad, and that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 24-1-15, under which the landowner was compensated, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and the husband had filed a complaint against the hospital and the unknown nurse for injuries that the patient received when she slipped and fell in the hospital bathroom. The complaint alleged that the hospital breached its fiduciary duty to the patient by allowing her to give a urinary sample by herself knowing that she was unable to do so without assistance. The trial court had dismissed the complaint because it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations under R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-1-14.1 (1956, 1969 reenactment).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regional school committee was composed of three representatives from each town. Because the population of the town of Foster was approximately one-half of that of the town of Glocester, the Glocester member contended that her vote was worth only one-half that of a Foster member's vote, in violation of the one-person, one-vote mandate of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. On review, the court rejected defendants' contention that the member was required to exhaust any administrative remedies before bringing a civil rights action alleging deprivation of federal constitutional rights. The trial court correctly found that the regional school committee was unconstitutionally apportioned because it was clear that both district and a county boards of education were general governmental bodies whose members had to be apportioned according to the principle of one-person, one-vote. Because monetary damages could not rectify the vote dilution, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the Glocester member injunctive relief.

The officers were involuntarily placed on the city's retirement list, which resulted in reductions in their weekly incomes. The lower court upheld the pension and retirement board's decision and the officers appealed. The court affirmed the lower court's decision because the city ordinance was authorized by special enabling legislation, which prevailed over the general legislation of &sect; 45-19-1. The court found no due process violations because the officers were not entitled to a hearing prior to their transfer from full disability to retirement status. In addition there were no equal protection violations where the classification scheme presently employed had a reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, or welfare of the citizens of the city.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended on appeal that his confession was elicited by force and coercion and that he had not been afforded his Miranda admonitions, that a photographic identification by two prosecution witnesses was suggestive, and that the trial court erred in refusing to admit prior recorded testimony of an alibi witness. The court sustained the appeal in part and vacated the conviction. The court stated that the record of the suppression hearing formed no basis to disturb the trial court's findings that defendant made a voluntary statement with reference both to the murder and to the robbery. The court found no suggestiveness in the identification. The court was of the opinion that the trial court erred in focusing its attention upon the ability of the witness to attend as opposed to the ability of defendant to secure her attendance. The court determined that because the witness was crucial to the establishment of defendant's alibi defense, the error was prejudicial to the presentation of the defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred when it denied defendant access to certain materials in the possession of an attorney hired by the victim's family and that the trial court erred when it failed to exclude the results of tests performed by state officials upon the contents of a black bag. The court vacated the convictions and remanded for a new trial. It found that material in the attorney's possession should have been disclosed because the attorney-client privilege was waived when the attorney turned over his information to the state investigators. Furthermore, the material was not protected by the work product doctrine because there was an implied waiver of the privilege. Finally, the state's failure to obtain a warrant to test the contents of the black bag could not be upheld under the plain-view doctrine or the harmless error exception to the warrant requirement and the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of defendants and on appeal the legislators argued that the trial court misapplied the speech and debate privilege and that the reapportionment plan violated equal protection and the state constitutional requirement of compactness. The court found that the testimony of certain representatives concerning the actions and motivations of the legislature in proposing and passing the reapportionment plan fell clearly within speech an debate privileges of the state and federal constitutions and was properly excluded. The court also found that the reapportionment plan did not violate the compactness requirement of R.I. Const. amend. XIII because the number of districts that crossed municipal boundaries was not so great as to suggest arbitrariness and there was a rational reason for the odd shape of one certain district. Finally, the court determined that the total deviation of the size of the districts from the ideal size, 5.4 percent, was not so great as to suggest an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a complaint under the Uniform Law on Paternity, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-8-6 (1956), alleging that the putative father was the father of her daughter. A master found the putative father to be the child's father and denied his defenses of laches and the statute of limitations. The putative father appealed the decree to the family court, which dismissed the mother's suit, finding that it was barred by the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations in the Bastardy Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 15, ch. 8 (1956). The court explained that the paternity statute provided for two alternative periods of limitation, four years after the birth of the child or four years after May 4, 1979, whichever was later, so the statute had to be given retrospective application. The court noted that the statute was remedial in nature and could be applied retrospectively. The court concluded that no disparity existed between legitimate and illegitimate children relative to their right to seek support from their fathers, so there was no violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

The district court agreed with the tax administrator that the taxpayer did not qualify because it used fuel to refrigerate its cars, in which it shipped perishable fruit, rather than to propel the cars along railroad tracks. The court looked at the history of the statute and determined that the legislature knew the difference between propulsion and operation. It had exempted fuel used to propel certain vehicles, but in the case of railroads it had exempted fuel used in their operation. The taxpayer's refrigerated cars were an integral part of the operation of railroads, used to meet the railroads' duty to transport perishable goods.

The manufacturer's motion for summary judgment claimed that R.I. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The machine was first sold by the manufacturer in November 1969; the employee filed suit in October 1981. On appeal of the summary judgment, the court first determined that analysis of the issue under R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 was appropriate, as the operation of &sect; 5 was not limited to prohibition of the purchase and sale of justice, but dealt with recourse to state law for injuries received. The court further found that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 9-1-13 was unconstitutional, holding that it completely denied products liability claimants their day in court, notwithstanding the merits of their claims and the direct liability of potential defendants. The court found that the employee's right of access to the court was absolutely barred by &sect; 9-1-13, as he was barred from bringing his action before he was able to discover the time frame that was applicable to his rights. The court found that it would have been manifestly unjust and inconsistent with R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, to bar the employee's right to access to the courts absolutely, and that R.I. Gen.

He was ordered to pay a nominal fine on each count. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, asserting that he had a constitutional right to appeal his convictions to the superior court and to have his case heard de novo by a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for keeping large trucks on his property and using his residentially-zoned property to run a business. He was fined $ 450 by the district court judge. Defendant filed a certiorari petition, seeking a determination that the Rhode Island Constitution provided him with the right to appeal the convictions to the superior court for a jury trial. In denying the petition, the court noted that the state constitution was adopted long before the zoning ordinances; it could have disposed of the matter simply by holding that the state constitution did not guarantee rights under a statute not in existence at the time it was adopted. Under the common law, defendants whose convictions were &quot;criminal in nature&quot; had the right to a jury trial. Zoning violations were never traditionally included within the common law jury trial right because, although offenders might be subject to penalties, they were not thought of as criminal violators. The court believed that judges were better at resolving zoning law violations, given that technical questions of fact were often involved. There was no reason to impose upon the already overcrowded superior court dockets with such matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's petition for certiorari, quashed the writ that it had granted, and remanded the papers back to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an action against defendant Director of Natural Resources (director) in the Superior Court (Rhode Island) and alleged that the condemnation of her property in 1946 and 1962 for the purpose of developing a state port facility violated R.I. Const. art. XVII. After a bench trial finding that the 1962 taking violated the constitution and that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 46-5-15 was unconstitutional, both parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three parcels of the landowner's property were taken by the state in a series of condemnation proceedings for the purpose of developing a state port facility. In 1946, the landowner filed three actions and sought damages against the state. The cases were consolidated and resolved when the landowner executed a general release and quitclaim deed in 1948 in exchange for compensation. The landowner filed the present action in 1972 on the basis that she had a constitutional right of preemption under article XVII. On appeal, the court held that the 1948 quitclaim deed conveyed all right, title, and interest that the landowner had in the condemned property. The court held that the release was not obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, or mutual mistake and that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 46-5-15 was constitutional. The court further held that the private benefits of the public port facility project were incidental to its public use. The court held that port facilities were outside the scope of article XVII and directed that the portion of the bench decision invalidating the 1962 condemnation and &sect; 46-5-15 be vacated. The court remanded to the trial court for entry of a new judgment for the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the portion of the trial court's decision that found the preemption rights guaranteed by the state constitution applicable to land taken for the construction of port facilities as well as that portion holding a statute unconstitutional. The court sustained the state's appeal and denied the landowner's appeal in its entirety. The court ordered the case remanded for the entry of a new judgment for the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former husband appealed the order of a Family Court (Rhode Island), which entered a divorce decree between defendant former wife and the husband in his petition for divorce and the wife's cross-petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting both petitions for divorce, the family court determined that both parties were entitled to support. However, it did not award either party support but made the marital-property assignment based on the support needs of both. The family court ordered the husband to convey his right in the marital home to the wife and give her exclusive possession and title to all the household furnishings and effects. In turn, she was ordered to pay the husband for his share in the conveyed property and to surrender some stock. The husband alleged that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 15-5-16.1, relating to property division, was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the statute provided sufficient guidelines for the trial court to follow. Secondly, the court held that the assignment of property did not depend on the needs of a spouse. Moreover, &sect; 15-5-16.1 directed the family court to make the assignment of property before an award of alimony. Therefore, the family court erred when it took into consideration the support needs of the parties in distributing the marital assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the husband's challenge to the constitutionality of a statute regarding the distribution of marital property, but sustained the portion of the husband's appeal relating to the manner in which the family court determined property division. The case was remanded for a reassignment of the marital property consistent with the guidelines set out in the applicable statute and in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of the amendments to the town's zoning ordinance, segments of the town's shoreline were designated high flood danger districts (HFD). One such area encompassed a beach where plaintiff's property was located. Classification of the beach as an HFD precluded plaintiff from constructing a home there. The trial court found that the HFD zone, as applied to plaintiff's property, constituted an indirect taking without compensation in violation of the Rhode Island Constitution, R.I. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The trial judge concluded that the town was obliged to exercise its powers of eminent domain to compensate plaintiff. However, rather than ordering compensation, the judgment enjoined the town from enforcing the provisions of the ordinance against plaintiff's property. On appeal, the court found that plaintiff established an action of inverse condemnation against the town and had to be compensated for a constructive &quot;taking&quot; of her property. The court affirmed so much of the judgment that found that there was a taking. The portion of the judgment that enjoined the town from enforcing its ordinance was vacated, and the case was remanded for a hearing on the value of the property.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed in part, vacated the punitive damages award, and remanded for a hearing on the credit company's counterclaim. The court found that the lower court erroneously held that the credit company had not perfected its security interest in the dealer's inventory, including the buyer's car. However, the court held that the buyer was a buyer in the ordinary course of business and thus that his possessory rights in the car were superior to those of the credit company. The court also held that the lower court improperly denied the credit company's motion to amend to add a compulsory counterclaim for the outstanding balance the buyer owed on the car. The court held that justice required this amendment, particularly where the buyer was not prejudiced because he admitted that he owed the money. The court also vacated the punitive damage award because the credit company did not engage in willful, reckless, or wicked conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress based upon the challenge to the sufficiency of the affidavit. Although the employees of Federal Express did not implicate the Fourth Amendment when they opened the package and inspected its contents, remand was necessary for the trial court to determine whether the DEA's field test of the substance constituted a significant expansion of the private search. If so, the trial court was required to determine whether the further search was valid under one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. Neither the exigent-circumstances exception nor the plain-view exception applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Medical Malpractice Reform Act of 1976 (Act), R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 10-19-1 to -5 (1981 reenactment) mandated that trial justices in the state conduct a preliminary hearing in medical malpractice cases to determine if the evidence was sufficient to raise a question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. Where the finding was that the case was merely one of an unfortunate medical result, the action was to be dismissed with prejudice. Trial justices in two malpractice actions vacated the assignment of each case for the preliminary hearing, believing the procedure to be unconstitutional. The court consolidated petitions for writ of certiorari, and upon review determined that the law mandating the procedure denied malpractice litigants equal protection of the laws. The court held that: (1) the classifications created by the Act did not infringe upon fundamental rights or employ suspect classifications and thus the rational basis review standard was applicable; but (2) because no malpractice crisis existed at the time of enactment, the Act did not have a rational basis and therefore the legislation impermissibly imposed unequal treatment on the malpractice litigants.</SPAN></P>

The debtor appealed, arguing that the statute authorizing the body execution was unconstitutional. The court noted that a body execution statute in another jurisdiction had been upheld by construing it to require a pre-incarceration hearing to determine the debtor's ability to pay. The court found that &sect; 9-25-15 could not be interpreted as requiring a hearing because it contained a provision that permitted issuance of execution pursuant to an ex parte motion. The court stated that it could sever the offending provision if it determined that, when the statute was enacted, the legislature would have passed it absent the objectionable provision. The court concluded that it could sever the ex parte provision and interpreted the remainder to require a pre-incarceration hearing to determine whether the debtor was able to pay the judgment and to order installment payments if he were not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose out of a plan to steal an inventory of precious metals from a manufacturing plant. Defendant, an attorney, testified at his codefendants' earlier trial, and the prosecutor in the instant case accused him of perjury. The court affirmed the convictions. The court upheld the indictments because even if the grand jury had knowledge of the case due to pretrial publicity, defendant failed to establish any resulting prejudice. The trial justice's social relationship with the Attorney General did not warrant recusal of the judge from the case. The joinder of the perjury count with the other counts of the indictment was proper because the testimony concerned the events occurring during the aborted break-in that formed the basis for the first five counts of the indictment. Requiring a separate trial for perjury would result in a duplication of effort. The court determined that the evidence on each count was sufficient to support the convictions. The prosecution introduced a great deal of evidence to support the jury's conclusion that defendant supplied a base of operations and afforded a safe haven to his fellow conspirators.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, political parties, Secretary of State, and the Board of Elections, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court (Rhode Island) that held 1982 R.I. Pub. Laws 20, which purported to reapportion and redistrict the state for the election of state senators, was unconstitutional. The superior court also enjoined the acceptance of declarations of candidacy and preparations for the upcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff voters had brought a class action raising claims under the state and federal constitutions and upon the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985(3) (1981). After the superior court entered its order, the court determined that the finding that 1982 R.I. Pub. Laws 20 was unconstitutional, revived the former statutes,&nbsp;R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 22-1-1, 22-1-2 (1979 Reenactment), and therefore the court lifted the injunction that barred the acceptance of declarations of candidacy and preparation for elections. Thereafter the legislature passed a new redistricting plan that was effective after the current elections. The voters then filed a complaint in the federal district court alleging the same violations and seeking the same injunctive relief, which the federal district court granted. The court found it disturbing that the federal district court did not under the abstention doctrine stay its hand given the issues of particular state importance. However, because the federal district exercised its discretion to assume jurisdiction to decide all federal and pendent state issues, the court felt the issues in the current appeal were moot and remanded for dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the appeal by the political parties, Secretary of State, and Board of Elections with instructions that all claims for injunctive relief were to have been dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college purchased the hotel to create a college facility. The city amended its housing code to prevent this, and filed suit to enjoin the college. The college counterclaimed arguing that the amendments were unconstitutional. The college also appealed two separate decisions of the city's zoning board which had affirmed the city building inspector's rejection of the college's occupancy permit. The superior court consolidated these three actions with an original suit filed by the college and ruled that the city's amendments to the housing code were unconstitutional and the city wrongfully denied the college an occupancy permit. On appeal by the city the court affirmed. The court found that prior to the city's actions a college had been a permitted use in the area in which the hotel was located. Further, the college was authorized to occupy the premises before seeking an occupancy permit as a college under the existing permitted use and the city building inspector's delay merely awaited the city's change in its housing code to prevent the college from entering the premises. Additionally, the city did not give proper notice of the meeting convened to pass the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute arose as defendants were engaged in a beach-clean-up operation. The landowner and a patrolman stopped defendants because the landowner believed that his private property extended to the mean-high-water line, had staked out that line previously. He informed defendants that they were not permitted to cross the landward side of it. Defendants believed that their right to traverse the shore extended to the high-water mark. Defendants crossed the mean-high-tide line but were below the high-water mark at the time of their arrest. The trial court and the lower court reached different conclusions based on their fixing the boundary between the shore and littoral owners at different points. The court concluded that the mean-high-tide line was the landward boundary of the shore for the purposes of the privileges guaranteed to the people of Rhode Island by the constitution. However, the court held that in view of the lack of clarity in early decisions regarding whether the landward boundary of the shoreline was to have been computed as a mean or as an absolute high-water mark, the court affirmed the dismissals of the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned certain property on an island. The coastal perimeter in that area was a salt marsh. The property owner planned to construct a two-bedroom dwelling upon each of his parcels. The property owner applied to the Coastal Resources Management Council for its approval of his plans. A subcommittee recommended that the council deny the applications. Subsequently, the council issued a written decision denying the applications. The property owner appealed and the superior court affirmed the council's decision. The court granted the property owner's petition for a writ of certiorari. The property owner attacked both the constitutionality of the Coastal Resources Management Council Act, R.I. Gen. Laws &sect;&sect; 46-23-1 to -17 (1980) and also the council's factual findings. The court held that the property owner failed to show that the classification of coastal areas by the act was an irrational legislative measure.

Defendant's conviction for disorderly conduct consisting of loud, profane, and opprobrious speech was constitutionally impermissible. The trial court excluded testimony of defendant's daughter regarding defendant's physical condition and demeanor, and convicted defendant. On review, the court reversed the conviction. The court held that the trial instructed the jury on self-defense, thereby placing the defense in issue; the court held that the excluded testimony was relevant to the issue of self-defense. The court held defendant's conviction under &sect; 11-45-1(b) for disorderly conduct consisting of loud, profane, and opprobrious speech was constitutionally impermissible.

The board affirmed both decisions. The court held that the committee could not avoid its obligation under R.I. Gen.

The mere fact that the record also contained evidence that would support contrary conclusions was irrelevant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 4-1-2 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed and found that the criminal complaint provided defendant with adequate notice of the offense with which he was charged. The court found that defendant was interviewed more than once by police officers who were investigating the incident. Defendant's involvement was such that he could have had no doubt concerning the offense with which he was charged. The term &quot;cruelly kill&quot; appeared in &sect; 4-1-2 within an extensive list of criminally culpable acts and omissions. Read in the context of the entire statute, it was anything but vague. The trial justice, sitting without a jury, found that defendant placed a healthy cat in a microwave oven and turned the oven on causing injuries resulting in the cat's death. He further found that defendant was indifferent to the pain and suffering he caused. The court found that reasonable inferences of severe suffering were easily drawn from the evidence. The evidence before the court was more than sufficient to satisfy the burden of proving the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
