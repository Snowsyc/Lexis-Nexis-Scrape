</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners denied the charges and claimed that ORS 696.300(1)(q) (1973), as applied to them, denied them due process under the Fourteenth Amendment Or.

The broker also appealed his 10-day license suspension for commingling his personal funds with those of his clients, in violation of ORS 696.300(1)(s) (1973) and OAR 863-10-025. The court determined that there was substantial evidence to support the findings of the Commissioner in that the petitioners had not told their clients that the broker was intending to purchase property they were attempting to sell through petitioners. The court concluded that petitioners owed a fiduciary duty to disclose to their clients the existence of an agreement to purchaser their property. The court further concluded that there was substantial evidence that the petitioners were untrustworthy and that the broker had commingled clients' funds as found by the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

The petitioners appealed, arguing that the trial court was required under the statue to order payment of the fees. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The statute provides that any judgment ordered in a proceeding for the enforcement of any delinquent support obligation was to include an order for the payment of the fees. However, the court found that a delinquent support obligation was one that was not timely made in compliance with a preexisting order for support. The father was not under any child support order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of burglary and forcible rape, both relating to the same episode. The Circuit Court, Umatilla County (Oregon) sentenced defendant on the rape charge only. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged (1) the trial court's instruction on resistance and (2) the method by which the jury was polled. Although the evidence fairly raised the jury question of whether the victim consented to or physically resisted defendant's assault upon her, the court held that the trial court gave a sufficient uniform instruction on the quantum of resistance by a victim that was necessary for conviction. The instruction rightly reflected ORS 163.305(3), which defined &quot;forcible compulsion,&quot; and Oregon State Bar, Uniform Jury Instruction No. 413.01, which defined &quot;earnest resistance.&quot; A much longer and more detailed instruction requested by defendant properly was refused. Next, the court held that defendant's exception on appeal to the trial court's refusal to conduct an oral poll of the jury was not preserved for review because defendant consented to a written jury poll without raising the constitutionality of a statutory change that essentially forbade oral jury polls despite prior precedents holding that the statutory right to poll the jury in a criminal case was absolute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant public utility commissioner appealed an order of the Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon), which ruled that penalties assessed against plaintiffs, an automobile parts deliverer and a trucking company, were unreasonable and reduced them. The deliverer and trucking company cross-appealed for a further reduction. They brought the action pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 756.580 to have the commissioner's order set aside or modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deliverer did not obtain a public utility commissioner's permit to pursue his business. He testified that he first wanted to determine whether the operation was profitable. He entered into a lease with the trucking company to operate under its permit. The trucking company established a division to lease trucks from the deliverer. The deliverer was to pay the trucking company for use of its permit. The deliverer made payments to the trucking company, but the trucking company did not make its payments. The drivers were employees of the trucking company. When the deliverer applied for a permit, the commissioner assessed penalties against him and the trucking company. They admitted the violations for a reduction. The deliverer and trucking company argued that the commissioner's order imposing the penalties was unlawful because he failed to promulgate rules prescribing the factors to be considered in mitigation proceedings. The court upheld the reduction and denied further relief. The public utility statute,&nbsp;&sect; 756.598, expressly gave the reviewing court authority to &quot;modify&quot; the commissioner's order. The circuit court reviewed the penalty and determined that it was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the circuit court and denied the cross-appeal of the deliverer and trucking company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument were so prejudicial that he was denied his right to due process. He also claimed that he was denied due process by the introduction of evidence of prior crimes of which he had been convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. During closing argument the prosecutor argued that if one witness had been convicted of a prior crime, defendant's attorney would have brought that out. The court held that the trial court did not err in permitting the prosecutor's remarks because defense counsel had attacked the credibility of the witness and the prosecutor's remarks were in direct response to that attack. The court held that it was permissible under ORS 45.600 to impeach an adverse witness by evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime. The court noted that defendant cited no authority that ORS 45.600 was unconstitutional and held that it was required to apply the statute in accordance with the intent of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.523. One issue was whether the preponderance of evidence standard of proof in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.525(2) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were four, three, and two years old. Police were notified that the youngest was found unattended and half-naked near a creek behind their apartment. She was in the care of her 11-year-old sister. The apartment was in an extremely unsanitary condition. The mother attended a hearing at which custody was awarded to the Oregon Children's Services Division. For eight months thereafter CSD could not locate the mother nor did she contact CSD. Around Christmas, she demanded a chance to visit her children in order to give them presents, but she never attempted to arrange visitation. She failed to respond to requests by the CSD to suggest a plan for reintegration of the children with the family. After 13 months, CSD brought the petition to terminate. On appeal, the court held that due process was served by the requirement in &sect; 419.525(2) that the State show by a preponderance of the evidence that a ground for termination of parental rights existed. Given that the most important consideration was the best interests of the children, the court held that there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings and the termination of the mother's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

After the children were returned to the parents, the parents complained of the initial removal and the fact that they remained wards of the court. The children complained about their return. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the evidence supported the allegations because there was evidence that the children suffered from developmental milestones as a result of their lack of nourishment or attention. The court also held that it agreed with the lower court that the parents should have been given an opportunity to improve their performance as parents; thus the return to the parents' custody, but in order for the court to continue to monitor their progress, it was important that they remained wards of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The annexation being challenged by the residents was for the provision of a sewage collection treatment center. ORS 222.850 through 222.915 (Oregon) provided the procedure for statutory annexation in the case where there was a danger to the public health. The facts were not in dispute. The original petition was filed with the Division resulting in a hearing. Notice of the hearing was duly given. Facts found by the hearing officer and signed by the administrator; thus approved in the effective order, were made on which the annexation determination was made. The residents mad a constitutional challenge of the procedure and alleging violations of equal protection. They also argued there was an unlawful delegation of the legislative power to the Division. The court found a delegation with proper safeguards was made making ORS 215.108 (Oregon) a valid delegation of power. The court also found that the residents did not have standing to challenge the procedure on the basis that property owners who were not residents were not given equal classification because their own rights were not affected.</SPAN></P>

The matter was remanded to the referee. The referee awarded compensation. The Board and circuit court affirmed. The SAIF complained about the circuit court's earlier judgment interpreting the limitation-period statutes.

The circuit court dismissed the resident's declaratory judgment action on sovereign immunity grounds. On appeal, the court affirmed, but only because Or. Const. art.

Overruling prior precedent, the court found that the authority guaranteed by art.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.310. After the circuit court hearings were completed, the father filed a motion for an order dismissing the proceedings, or in the alternative for a mistrial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the adoption proceeding, the father was serving a ten-year prison sentence for killing his son's mother.

The court held that the denial of the father's motion for dismissal or mistrial was not error because independent counsel could have made no significant contribution under the circumstances. The court rejected its own prior ruling that independent counsel responsible for representing the child was required in every termination case. The court also rejected the father's contention that by treating imprisoned parents differently and less favorably than other parents, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.322 violated the equal protection and due process guarantees of the United States and Oregon Constitutions. The court noted that there was ample evidence in the record which indicated that the child's welfare was best promoted by permitting respondents to become his legal parents.

Stat. &sect; 163.435(1)(b), would have been given only a one year prison sentence was inconsequential because it was the prerogative of the legislature and the trial court to assess the penalty for such a crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative's pleading sounded in negligence, alleging in effect that his decedent was killed by defendants as a result of their negligence. The court determined that it was a question of fact for the jury to determine whether the officers' entry into the restaurant was, under the claimed exigencies, a reasonable act, and whether or not it was done in good faith in the performance of their duties. It was a question of fact for the jury to consider and determine whether the officers had probable cause to believe, as they contended, that a felony was being committed in the building at the time they entered. The court found that there was presented a question of fact for the jury and thus no error was committed in the failure to remove that allegation of contributory negligence from the affirmative defense. The court determined that the question of whether a reasonable man would, under the circumstances then and there existing, have identified himself in some manner to the police officers before himself initiating the interchange of gunfire was a question of fact for and was properly submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county imposed the tax at issue by an ordinance that contained an emergency clause. Although emergency legislation was not subject to referendum under Oregon law, the ordinance was submitted to the voters by referendum and a majority voted against approval of the ordinance. The trial court ruled in favor of defendants in the county's action to recover the tax on the ground that the county had waived any application of the emergency clause by acquiescing to the referendum. On appeal, the court ruled that the action of two county administrative officers in cooperating to put the referendum on the ballot had been unauthorized and that such action did not constitute a waiver or implied repeal of the emergency clause. The court also ruled that a purported waiver of the emergency clause by a municipal official could not be the basis for a claim that the municipality was estopped. Also, the elements of estoppel were not established in the record. As to defendants' claim that no emergency, in fact, had existed, the court ruled that declarations of emergency were conclusive on the courts and could not be reviewed or called into question by them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prohibited from entering a certain chain of stores for any purpose. When a store detective observed him in a store and saw him remove a shopping cart full of groceries from the store without paying for them, defendant was charged with burglary in the second degree under &sect; 164.215. He was convicted of the offense, and appealed, alleging that &sect; 164.215 did not apply to the actions for which he was convicted because his entry had not been unlawful under the statute. The court disagreed and affirmed. It rejected defendant's contention that the words &quot;or&quot; and &quot;otherwise&quot; in the second clause of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.215(a) referred only to a time when the premises were not open. The court explained that, as defendant had been prohibited from entering any store in the chain without permission from an officer of the corporation, he was not a member of the general public to whom the premises were open, even during business hours. By virtue of that notice he was neither a business visitor nor a licensee when he entered the premises with intent to steal, but a trespasser. The court held that the legislature intended to include defendant's actions under &sect; 164.215(a).</SPAN></P>

At issue, inter alia, was whether the order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence per ORS 183.480(7)(d) and ORS 421.195; and whether the order was lawful per ORS 421.480.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute arose when the inmate, after serving a long shift on a firefighting crew, refused to return to the fire following a six-hour break. He claimed that he was too tired to return. He was charged with disobedience of an order and a disciplinary committee, after reviewing a corrections officer's report, found the inmate guilty and recommended that the time be forfeited. When the superintendent approved the recommendation, the inmate appealed, but the court affirmed. Noting the requirement in ORS 183.480(7)(d) and ORS 421.195 that a reviewing court was only permitted to consider whether factual determinations relied on below were supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the whole record, the court held that the written report of the corrections officer on which the discipline initially was based in fact supported the decision. The court also rejected the inmate's claim that the sole appropriate sanction for his refusal to work was his return to the penitentiary. Noting that the procedure outlined in ORS 421.480 was followed, the court held that while reconfinement was a permitted sanction, it was not the only sanction available under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the superintendent that the inmate was required to forfeit 30 days of statutory good time on account of his having disobeyed an order.</SPAN></P>

Affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that, inasmuch as the circuit court could treat the same act of criminal activity in drugs under ORS 167.207(2) (Oregon) either as a Class B felony or (under the criteria of ORS 161.705 (Oregon)) as a Class A misdemeanor, it could do the same under a conviction for conspiracy to commit the same crime (using the same criteria) under ORS 161.450(2)(b) and (d) (Oregon).

The court found, however, that the record established that the inspector displayed his badge to the employee, and identified himself as a commission representative. Moreover, the commission representative and another individual employed by the restaurant testified that the employee stated that the commission representative was an inspector. The court also rejected the argument that &sect; 472.170 was unconstitutional because it authorized a warrantless search. The court found that the state had the authority to permit general inspections of areas of the city for the purpose of insuring compliance with liquor laws.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that except for the fact that the branch water pipes were plastic, not metal, in violation of Oregon OAR 333-44-456(4), defendant did not violate any state or county laws or requirements relating to water systems, sewage disposal systems, or the issuance of certificates of sanitation or licenses to mobile home parks. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the trial court was required to grant injunctive relief because defendant's park was being operated without a certificate of sanitation, in violation of Oregon ORS 446.006, and because the trial court could not excuse the violation of Oregon OAR 333-44-456(4) by the posting of a bond. The court held that (1) the trial court did not have the authority to order the issuance of a certificate if defendant posted a bond in view of the admitted violation of Oregon ORS 446.006; (2) the trial court was bound to enforce the law as written even if it considered application and enforcement of the law to be inequitable under the circumstances; and (3) a trial court sitting in equity did not have the authority to alter a direct statutory mandate or to disregard the terms of a statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Stat. &sect; 166.045(1)(a) permitted arrests on suspicion and was unconstitutional on that ground as well because the mere presence of a person in or near a school grounds for a purpose not related to the custody or responsibility of a student did not necessarily manifest a purpose to commit a specific crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which convicted him of four counts of murder in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred: (1) in admitting evidence of a prior criminal trespass; (2) in refusing to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the State intentionally destroyed fingerprint evidence found at the scene of the crime; (3) in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal; and (4) in instructing on felony murder. In admitting the prior crime evidence, the trial court relied upon two exceptions to the general exclusionary rule, the identity and motive exceptions. There were three common elements of the identity exception entitled to consideration: (1) similar entry, (2) similar time, and (3) minimal effort to hide. The court noted that there were two dissimilarities, the length of time between the two crimes, 27 months, and the great difference in the amount of violence in the two crimes. The court reversed and held that the admission of the evidence in question was improper after the similarities and dissimilarities were evaluated. The court concluded that the facts did not provide a proper basis for the inference that the person who committed the other crime was the same person who committed the crimes in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner applied to the Department of Transportation for permission to build a house on each of the two lots into which her approximately eight acres were divided. After several discussions and much correspondence with the landowner, an on-site visit, and a survey by Department of Transportation staff members, the Department of Transportation denied permission to construct the houses. In that letter, however, it did grant permission if several requirements were met, including the requirement that landowner start to build within one year of the letter and complete exterior construction within six months thereafter. The landowner did not build but instead brought this action. The trial court dismissed the landowner's complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Scenic Waterways Act authorized the Department of Transportation to regulate the use of adjacent land and that the landowner's claim that the State had acquired a &quot;scenic easement&quot; thereby constituting a taking was incorrect. The court held that the regulation of the use of such lands was pursuant to the State's police powers and was therefore lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The port owned and operated a marina facility. The board ordered the port to install four reduced pressure anti-backflow devises pursuant to OAR 333-42-017. The port did not comply with the order. The board notified the port that its water service would be terminated. The port filed suit against the board and the city to enjoin them from terminating the water supply. The lower court denied it an injunction. The court affirmed, holding that the port was in violation of OAR 333-42-017. OAR 333-42-017 provided that backflow prevention devices had to be installed on each service line of a customer's system at or near the property line, but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever certain conditions existed. The facility and its existing water supply system fit well within the definition of a cross-connection under OAR 333-42-017(1)(e). There was an abundance of evidence to support the board's finding that the water of a bay was contaminated. The possibility of contamination of the water system by a backflow from the bay was not so mathematically remote as to make the regulation unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The person that telephone calls were made to had an immediate family. Many anonymous telephone calls threatening lives were made early mornings. Section 166.065(1)(c) stated in part that it was harassment to communicate with a person by telephone in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm where the caller communicated with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness. To be valid, a statute defining a crime had to define that crime so precisely as to enable persons of common intelligence to understand what was outlawed. Per the court, the statute passed that test. The court wrote that a person of common intelligence would have no difficulty in knowing that repeated anonymous telephone calls at 2 and 3 A.M. in which the recipient's life was threatened would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm. The court cited precedent regarding the common dictionary definitions of harass, alarm, annoy, which precedent provided that all those terms related to the invasion of other people's privacy and freedom: invasion of the sanctity of the person or invasion of peace of mind.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's objection to a prior order incorporating a &quot;cost bill&quot; filed by the State. The court reversed. The court had jurisdiction to consider defendant's appeal from the imposition of special costs because it fell within the scope of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050. The imposition of costs were properly characterized as an attempt by the circuit court to amend defendant's sentence and, therefore, involved &quot;matters pertaining to&quot; the sentence because the terms of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.665-.685 contemplated that an order requiring payment of costs was to be entered as an element of defendant's sentence. The original sentence imposed by the circuit court was indisputably within its authority and valid. Once defendant &quot;commenced service&quot; of that sentence by beginning to serve the jail time and having his security deposit credited, the circuit court's jurisdiction to supplement it by amendment was exhausted.

On appeal, the court concluded that the material was constitutionally protected by the First Amendment. The statutes under which defendants were convicted both depended on the definition of &quot;nudity&quot; in ORS 167.060(5). The only materials in the exhibits that came within this definition were the pictures of human female breasts with the markings covering the nipples and areolas of the subjects' breasts. Thus, defendants' First Amendment contentions related solely to the last sentence of ORS 167.060(5), which could not validly prohibit the material.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's sole assignment of error was that the circuit court erred in overruling her demurrer to the complaint. Defendant was first tried and convicted in district court and appealed her conviction to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At both the district and circuit court levels, defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground that the statute was an unconstitutional violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Art I, &sect; 1, of the Bill of Rights of the Oregon Constitution. Defendant contended that the State could not prevent persons from bringing into the State alcoholic liquor purchased elsewhere so long as such possession was intended for personal consumption and not for resale. The court rejected defendant's contention, holding that the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution allowed the states broad regulatory power over liquor traffic within their boundaries. Indeed, a state could absolutely prohibit the manufacture, sale, possession, or transportation of alcoholic liquor and could adopt measures reasonably appropriate to effectuate such prohibition. It followed that if a state could prohibit entirely the sale, possession, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic liquor, it could permit these things under definitely prescribed conditions.</SPAN></P>

The causes of action alleged were for physical injuries incurred in an alleged assault and battery, false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and outrageous conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonresident attended a public hearing held by the city council. A nonresident of the city was entitled to be heard at a public hearing only after he submitted a letter asking to be heard, at least one week prior to the date of the hearing. The nonresident did not submit such a letter. Another nonresident rose to speak at the meeting. The mayor ruled that he was out of order. The nonresident protested the ruling and refused to sit down. The mayor became angry and pounded his gavel, causing the head of the gavel to go flying across the room. The mayor recessed the meeting. The two police officers were called to remove the nonresident. He forcibly resisted removal. The nonresident was charged and then acquitted of two counts of disorderly conduct. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the police officers used no more force than necessary to accomplish their orders; (2) under the circumstances, the mayor was not acting unreasonably in ordering the officers to remove the nonresident from the meeting; and (3) when the nonresident chose to violently give physical resistance, he brought about the eventual arrest and prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that constitutional freedom of religious practice was not a valid defense to a penal charge based on possession of a drug even if defendant possessed the drug solely for the practice of his bona fide religious beliefs.

The court explained that the mental element of disorderly conduct was precisely defined and enabled people of common intelligence to understand what was prohibited. Further, the action element of disorderly conduct was described with words of common usage with well-defined and generally accepted meanings.

The court noted that although the individual had a right to counsel in an involuntary commitment proceeding, the rule did not have retroactive application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A demurrer to the optometrist's petition was sustained and he thereupon filed an amended pleading seeking declaratory relief to which a demurrer was also sustained. When he refused to plead further, an order of dismissal was entered. The action was brought after the Board sent the optometrist a cease and desist letter requiring him to discontinue his advertising plan. It was alleged that his advertising violated ORS 683.140(6), (12) and (13) and ORS 683.180(9). On appeal, the court held that the demurrer to the petition for review should not have been sustained. There were numerous Oregon cases which were contrary in principle to the Board's position that certain communications were not final orders. In effect the Board argued that because it could not directly enforce its interpretation of the advertising statutes by, for example, getting an injunction against the optometrist, but could enforce its interpretation only by taking away his license, the Board's communications did not purport to affect any right or privilege of the optometrist. That argument answered itself.</SPAN></P>

The builder claimed that an unreasonable classification was made in ORS ch 701, that he was prejudiced because his motion to change venue was denied, and that the Builders Board did not have jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder, who was not registered under ORS 701.055(1), contracted with some customers to complete a structure to their satisfaction for a fixed sum. After the builder had accepted a partial payment and partially completed the structure, the customers refused to allow him to proceed. The builder sued the customers to recover the balance of the agreed upon price for the job. In the present case, a hearing officer entered findings, conclusions, and a proposed order that the builder forfeit a civil penalty for violating ORS 701.055(1). The Builders Board ordered the builder to pay a larger penalty. The builder appealed, claiming that the Builders Board did not had jurisdiction because of his pending suit against the customers, that ORS ch 701 was an unconstitutional impairment of contract, and that his motion for a change of venue was improperly denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning that the Builders Board had jurisdiction because the proceeding was distinct from the civil case, the contract was executed after ORS ch 701 was enacted, and the Oregon Administrative Procedures statutes did not provide for changes of venue in proceedings under ORS 701.055(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowner brought a writ of review proceeding against appellant city in the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon) to reverse and annul the city's action in assessing the landowner with a proportionate share of the cost of improving a street abutting the landowner's property. The circuit court sustained the landowner's objections and declared the assessment null and void. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued on appeal that the circuit court had erred in finding that the landowner, the operator of a drive-in movie theater, received no benefit from an improved street that would provide ingress and egress to a new subdivision where the landowner already had access to a through street. The court ruled that the landowner had failed to establish that the city council had acted arbitrarily in its determination that the landowner benefited from the improved street and thus had failed to overcome the presumption that its property was properly assessed with a share of the cost of the improvement. The court further ruled that the challenged assessment could not be overturned on the ground that the landowner had been denied equal protection of the law where there was no evidence showing that the city was not applying its ordinances uniformly or that the landowner was treated differently than other property owners abutting on subdivision perimeter streets elsewhere in the city. The court also ruled that the city was not required to assess and collect the entire cost from the subdividers, either under the subdivision ordinance or a performance agreement.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that the employee was not entitled to a hearing at which the employer was required to establish cause for discharge. On appeal, the court affirmed that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.663 did not provide a statutory requirement for hearing procedures beyond the constitutional authorities that set minimum standards. The court examined legislative history, which was inconclusive, and related statutes and concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.663 only created the right to an informational administrative hearing. The employer's standard for dismissal of employees in non-teaching positions was the efficient management of the schools. The court also held that the employee did not have any reasonable expectation of permanent employment. Thus, the employee could not claim a trial-type hearing, either under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Multnomah County (Oregon), which dismissed the charges against petitioner juvenile, alleging that the circuit court erred in denying the State's motion to amend the petition or, in the alternative, that the circuit court erred in failing to hold that sexual abuse was a lesser included offense in the crime of attempted rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the commencement of the hearing on the charge, the State moved to amend the petition to charge the juvenile with sexual abuse in the first degree, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.425, rather than attempted rape, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.375. The circuit court judge denied the State's motion to amend the petition. The State did not dismiss and refile, but rather presented evidence that the juvenile forcibly subjected the victim to sexual contact, not attempted rape. The circuit court dismissed the petition against the juvenile, refusing to allow sexual abuse as a lesser included offense of the crime of attempted rape. On appeal, the court held that, if it were a criminal case, the appeal would clearly be barred by the double jeopardy clauses in the U.S. Const. amend. V and the Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court held that any procedure constitutionally required in criminal proceedings, which was one of the essentials of due process and fair treatment, would also be required in juvenile proceedings. Thus, the court concluded that double jeopardy protection was required in the instant juvenile proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day set for trial in the circuit court, defendant's counsel stated he wished to move for a ruling on the admissibility of the breathalyzer test prior to the calling of the jury. After hearing, the circuit court ruled the test was inadmissible because the district court jury had necessarily determined the test was unreliable when that jury acquitted defendant of the Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 483.999 charge, and thus, the State was precluded from litigating that issue a second time. The State then declined to proceed until appellate review of the decision could be obtained. As a result, the circuit court entered the order of dismissal, which reflected its ruling on the question of the evidence's admissibility. On appeal, the court reversed because defendant's acquittal in the district court did not deprive the test results of all probative value and the circuit court lacked the authority to dismiss the matter in the face of the State's attempt to pursue an appeal of the order suppressing the test results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city appealed from an order of the Public Employe Relations Board (Oregon) in a case brought by respondent union, which concluded that, by virtue of ORS 243.772 (1973), the city ordinance governing the city's labor relations with its employees, City of Beaverton, Or., Ordinance 1700 (1971), was invalid because it differed significantly with the system governing labor relations between all public employers and employees in Oregon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By its terms, ORS 243.650 to 243.782 (1973) (the 1973 Act) applied to all public employers and employees in the state. The issue was whether the Board was correct in interpreting ORS 243.772 (1973) as giving it authority to invalidate local legislation even if, by so doing, it deprived home rule cities of the power to legislate on matters in which their interest, as distinguished from the state's, was paramount. The court held that the board's interpretation of the statute was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(5) and art. XI, &sect; 2 constituted a grant of home rule power to municipalities. Citing a prior decision holding that the legislature did not have the authority to enact a law relating to city government, even if it generally applied to all cities in the state, unless the subject matter was of general concern to the state as a whole, the court ruled that the board's interpretation of ORS 243.772 made the 1973 amendments paramount in matters of predominantly local concern, contrary to the constitution. However, the court stated that the Board could still invalidate any provisions of the city's ordinance that purported to govern matters of predominantly statewide concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the Board was reversed and the case was remanded so that the Board might have an opportunity to examine the city ordinance section by section and hold invalid those provisions, if any, which purported to govern matters of predominantly statewide concern and which were in conflict with the provisions of the 1973 Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action instituted by plaintiff to have all of Oregon Laws 1973, ch. 828 declared invalid, a three-member panel of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon) held that a portion of ORS 456.635 (Oregon) and all of ORS 456.715, 456.720(5) were void, but that these parts were severable and therefore the balance of the Act was valid. Both plaintiff and defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act at issue created a state housing agency and authorized it to provide for the construction, rehabilitation, purchase, leasing and refinancing of low-cost housing. The circuit court held that a portion of ORS 456.635 (Oregon) and all of ORS 456.715, 456.720(5) (Oregon) violated art. XI, &sect; 7 of the Oregon Constitution, which prohibited the state from lending its credit or creating any debt that singly or in the aggregate with previous debt would exceed $ 50,000. The court ruled that ORS 456.720(5) (Oregon) could not legally effectuate what it purported to do, which was to authorize a governor to certify in his next budget request and a future legislature to appropriate for the payment of a deficit in a revenue bond capital reserve account, either directly or by the indirection of seeking to create by statutory wording a so-called &quot;moral obligation&quot; to pay from general funds despite the constitutional prohibition. The court further ruled that the insurance provisions of ORS 456.635, 456.715 (Oregon) could also lead to indebtedness of the state, but could be interpreted as preventing any contract of loan insurance except from special revenue funds and, thus, were not void.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that there were no precise definitions of &quot;primarily&quot; and &quot;reasonable distance&quot; because each case depended on its own facts and circumstances. The court determined that &sect; 10-730 was not overbroad and the Commission's conclusions were based upon substantial evidence pursuant to ORS 183.480 (7)(d).

An inspector from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) went to investigate reports that the restaurant was closed and that meals were no longer available where alcoholic liquor was being served. The inspector went to the hotel at noon and ordered beer and breakfast. The meal was allegedly otherwise uncooked potatoes and ham heated in a microwave with several pieces of bread. The waitress reported that the eggs requested could not be cooked in the microwave. The OLCC suspended the licensee's liquor license for 30 days for failing to provide regular meals during the usual hours when such meals were regularly served in violation of Or. Admin. R. ch. 845, &sect; 10-185(2). The court reversed the order, holding that there was no requirement that food served by licensees be palatable or that prohibited the preparation of meals in a microwave oven and therefore that the OLCC's order revoking the license was unlawful in substance.</SPAN></P>

The licensee argued that there was no evidence to support a violation of the regulation and that it was unconstitutionally vague. Affirming, the court found that the regulation was valid. The court found that there was the requisite amount of evidence under ORS 183.480 (7)(d) to show that the licensee did not provide regular meals as required by OAR 845-10-185 (2). The regulation was not void for vagueness. An aspect of the regulation had been reviewed by the Oregon Supreme Court in another case, where it was found that language in the regulation that had a clear, grassroots connotation was not vague.

The adoptive parents refused to relinquish custody of the child, moved to Oregon, and filed a petition to adopt the child. The trial court denied their petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.326, which provided that a natural father's consent was not needed for an adoption, was unconstitutional, However, the court concluded that it was unlikely that the child's natural father would assert his rights in this case. The court held that natural mother's consent was effectively revoked because she was not represented by counsel at the time consent for the adoption was given, that her withdrawal of consent was within a few weeks of the grant of consent, and that she had taken action to get the child back. The court concluded that the fact that the adoptive parents were in a superior economic position did not negate the withdrawal of consent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of burglary not in a dwelling, as defined by ORS 164.240.

ORS 137.225(1) applied to convictions obtained prior to September 9, 1971. On appeal, the court held that (1) Class C felonies were unknown to Oregon law before 1971, so defendant could obtain relief only if he was convicted of a crime punishable as either a felony or a misdemeanor; (2) although there were several discretionary felony or misdemeanor punishment statutes in existence when defendant was convicted, burglary not in a dwelling was not one of them; (3) although current law provided that certain burglaries committed in non-dwellings were Class C felonies, there was no language in ORS 137.225 to indicate an intention that courts examine pre-1971 felony convictions and categorize them under the new code; (4) 137.225 was clear and required no statutory interpretation; and (5) 137.225 did not deny defendant equal protection of the law because the legislature permissibly could classify offenses based on how they were treated at the time of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court allowed two separate writs of prohibition against the municipal court and the court consolidated the appeals. The city's demurrers were both overruled at the trial level and the trial court found that the use of writs of prohibition were proper means of determining whether the municipal court did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the underlying claims in which defendants were involved. These claims were attacks on a city ordinance that inhibited their abilities to conduct voir dire examinations. Defendants did not allege that they made any objection before the municipal court challenging its actions. The court found that two of the conditions required for the issuance of a writ of prohibition were not met. Defendants did not show that the municipal court's exercise of its power was not authorized by law or that the injury alleged was not one that could not be adequately addressed by a legal remedy. Defendants had an appeal de novo in the circuit court as an avenue of redress, making a writ of prohibition unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 657.176 (1) from receiving unemployment benefits because he was discharged for misconduct connected with his work. The claimant contended that the statute was void for vagueness, that there was no substantial evidence to support the finding of misconduct, and that he was denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By union agreement, employees where the claimant worked were prohibited from using uncompensated time to prepare for work or to check out their till after their shift. The claimant had arguments with a fellow employee in the presence of customers regarding that employee's noncompliance with the union agreement. The court found that there was evidence in the record to support the conclusion of the appeals board that arguing with a fellow employee in the presence of customers over union matters constituted misconduct in connection with the work within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657.176. The court determined that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague and that the phrase &quot;misconduct connected with his work&quot; was a sufficiently definite standard for discharge from employment. The court rejected the claimant's procedural arguments. There was nothing in the record concerning a request under Or. Admin. R. 40-020 (7) or a refusal of such request to examine the claim file before the hearing, and the claimant cited no rule requiring that he be furnished a transcript before the appeals board hearing or special notice advising him of his right to appeal to the appeals board.</SPAN></P>

The children sought the appointment of independent counsel, but that application was denied. The trial court judge then terminated the parents' rights, and both the parents and their children appealed. The court affirmed the judgment insofar as the parents' six appellate claims were concerned, but remanded the matter to the trial court for the appointment of independent counsel for the children. As to the children, the court held that there was a conflict of interest not only in their interests being represented by their parents' counsel, but also in their interests being represented by the government's attorneys. Remand was therefore required, with the children authorized to present whatever evidence they believed proper on the subject. As to the parents' claims, the court held that the termination statute relied upon was not unduly vague, that there was no violation of their self-incrimination or physician-patient privilege by requiring them to speak with a psychologist prior to the hearing, and that the evidence of unfitness was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The case arose after the driver was suspended for violating the district's appearance regulations by wearing a beard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Accepting the district's evidence on the purpose of its regulation against facial hair, the court concluded that a regulation relating to the effect upon ridership of the appearance of employes having direct contact with the actual riding public was clearly related to the authorized purposes of the district under Or.

The court held that the district met the voluntarily-assumed the burden of proof as to the reasonableness of the regulations by presenting the testimony of its superintendent and assistant superintendent. The two officials presented uncontroverted evidence showing a relationship between driver appearance and customer relations. The court also concluded that there was too tenuous a connection between the driver's grooming and one's expression of opinion to justify application of Or. Const. art I, &sect; 8, or the First Amendment to the appearance regulations. Finally, the court found that the district's grooming regulation was reasonably related to its legitimate interest in maximizing ridership.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under ORS 421.195 (Oregon), petitioner prisoner sought judicial review of the final order of the superintendent of respondent Oregon State Penitentiary, which adopted the recommendation of a disciplinary committee to place the prisoner in segregation for 90 days for loitering, disobeying a direct order, displaying disrespect to the staff, and exhibiting major disruptive behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was charged with violating several penitentiary rules. After a hearing, the committee recommended that the prisoner be placed in segregation for 90 days. The superintendent adopted the recommendation. The prisoner sought judicial review, contending that the length of segregation was excessive. The court affirmed. The prisoner was not entitled to challenge the order placing him in segregation for 90 days on the ground that the punishment was excessive because the court lacked authority to alter the punishment under ORS 183.480(7)(a), (b) (Oregon) when it was not shown that the order was unconstitutional or unlawful. The superintendent did not violate Rule IV(5) of the Procedures for Disciplinary Action (Oregon) in issuing the order of segregation five days after the committee's hearing because Rule IV(5) merely required that the committee's written decision be issued within three days of the hearing. The prisoner's contention that he received a multiple punishment for a single act lacked merit because there was nothing to indicate that a single sanction would be unlawful if based on only one of the infractions for which the prisoner was charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought a review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Multnomah County (Oregon) that terminated their parental rights to their seven-year-old daughter after it was alleged by appellee, a county juvenile department, that the parents were unable to adequately care for their daughter and it was in her best interests for their rights to be terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents denied the factual basis for the termination and blamed the agencies for their inability to care for their daughter. The court determined that another daughter of the parents had been removed from their custody the year before. The court further determined that the testimony showed that it was the unanimous belief of the experts who testified that there was no indication that the parents would improve except for a few weeks in advance of a hearing before the court when they seemed to pull themselves together in a sporadic effort. The court concluded that the record was replete with specific instances of inadequacy, descriptions of drunkenness on the part of the husband, evidence of fighting between the parents, examples of the inability of the wife to keep anything except a filthy house, and experiences of the husband's utter failure to get and keep a job. The court finally concluded that the termination was in the best interest of the daughter, which was the court's paramount consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the judgment of the circuit court that terminated the parents' rights was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He appealed pro se from the habitual criminal sentence, which was affirmed. Thereafter, defendant instituted a post-conviction proceeding, contending that he had been denied the right to assistance of counsel on his appeal. The post-conviction court agreed and granted defendant the right to appeal anew, with counsel, from the habitual criminal proceeding. Defendant assigned as error the trial court's refusal to hear evidence relating to the alleged discrimination by the prosecutor in the manner in which he enforced the habitual criminal statute. The court held that the proffered evidence was properly refused. Defendant contended that the time period between the judgment of conviction on the charge of felon in possession of a concealable firearm and the filing of the habitual criminal information was unreasonable under former ORS 168.040(2). The court held that the 114-day time period was not unreasonable because defendant did not assert or show any prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to sustain his motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of his person and automobile. The claim presented the issues of whether the motion to suppress complied with the specificity requirements and the requirements of Lane County (Oregon) Circuit Court Rule 7.015. To support a motion to suppress, it had to be submitted with a supporting affidavit and brief. The motion stated that the search was warrantless and that no probable cause existed. The motion, although generally conclusory, was sufficiently specific to meet the minimum specificity required; however, they violated Rule 7.015 by failing to set forth all facts within defendant's knowledge upon which he intended to rely in support of the motion to suppress. The circuit court apparently invited defense counsel to file an affidavit setting forth such facts, but defense counsel persisted in his refusal to do so. The rule did not violate any constitutional provision. The circuit court acted properly in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted, but the trial court later acquitted him of the charge, ruling that the convicted charge was not a lesser-included offense of the charged crime. An indictment was brought against defendant for a charge of burglary not in a dwelling, and defendant pleaded double jeopardy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested for loitering outside of a school building and a search of their persons revealed the possession of drugs, which resulted in charges of criminal activity in drugs.

The State appealed and the court reversed the order granting the motions, finding that the motions lacked specificity and the orders of the trial court failed to state the basis on which they were granted. The motions alleged that the evidence was the result of defendants' illegal arrests but stated nothing to support the basis upon which they claimed the arrests were illegal. The court concluded that the written motions to suppress evidence had to specify with particularity the grounds upon which they were based. The orders granting the motions stated nothing more than the fact that they were granted, which left the court with no basis upon which to determine the scope of its review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants demurred to the charges on the ground that Portland, Or., Code &sect; 16.06.060, was unconstitutional. The court noted that the parking provisions of the Portland City Code as a whole established a permissive inference that the owner of the vehicle was the party who parked the vehicle. The court stated that because the ordinance permitted imprisonment for parking offenses, it was criminal in nature, procedural due process was implicated, and the validity of the inference must be evaluated in light of due process requirements. The court noted in considering the constitutionality of the inference that the United States Supreme Court had determined that there must be a rational connection between the facts proved and the fact presumed. The U.S. Supreme Court also stated that that an inference was unconstitutional unless it could be said that the presumed fact was more likely than not to flow from the proven fact on which it depended. The court found that the permissive inference that the owner of an automobile was the person who parked it met due process standards because it met both the &quot;rational connection&quot; and the &quot;more-likely-than-not&quot; requirements.</SPAN></P>

First, the companies contended that the statute under which the licenses were taken away, Or. Rev.

The court held that the statute permitted revocation of a license based on any misrepresentation made in order to induce or prevent action by the Commission. The evil aimed at by the statute was the possibility that the Commission may be misinformed. It was not required that the Commission actually believed the erroneous information. The court held that the statute was not vague because the granting of administrative power by the statute provided guidance to the Commission to apply the statute. Accordingly, the statute was found to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.015 et seq. Defendant was convicted of possession of narcotic drugs in violation of former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 474.020. His initial sentence of five years was enhanced to 30 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information alleged that defendant had previously been convicted of (1) attempted rape in Texas, (2) attempted burglary in Mississippi, and (3) being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in Oregon. The information also alleged (4) a subsequent conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The State's expert testified that the fingerprints in the records for the first three offenses belonged to the same person but did not testify that they belonged to defendant. On appeal, the court held that this was not error because the State introduced defendant's photograph in connection with each of the records. Former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.080(2) permitted photographs as an acceptable, alternative method of identification. However, the court held that the trial court erred by considering the subsequent conviction in determining defendant's sentence. Former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.015 (4) provided that a conviction was not a former conviction for the purposes of an enhanced penalty if the conviction was rendered after the commission of the principal felony. Consideration of the fourth conviction might have improperly influenced the length of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association bred, raised, and sold game fowl, which were used by buyers for cockfighting. Some times, the association tested the birds for fighting instinct. The association sought a declaratory judgment that ORS 167.850 (Oregon) and ORS 167.860 (Oregon) were unconstitutional. The trial court found the statutes unconstitutional in that they provided different penalties for the same prohibited conduct. The court disagreed and reversed. ORS 167.850(1)(a) prohibited the intentional or reckless subjection of an animal to cruel mistreatment, whereas ORS 167.860(2) (Oregon) prohibited the criminally negligent subjection of an animal to the same cruel mistreatment and provided for a lesser penalty. Thus, the two statutes did not provide different penalties for the same offense but differentiated penalties on the basis of the culpable mental state of the actor, and in some respects the acts prohibited were different. There was no basis for concluding that the legislature did not intend to include &quot;cockfighting.&quot; The statutes specifically included birds as animals, and both statutes prohibited all cruel mistreatment except that otherwise authorized by law or specifically exempted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue raised by the company on appeal related to the constitutionality of &sect; 10.53. The company contended that when the challenged section was read in conjunction with the purpose clause and the interpretation clause of the zoning ordinance, sufficient standards were provided to guide the planning commission. The court considered the zoning ordinance as a whole to see if standards guiding the discretion of the zoning authorities in applying &sect; 10.53 were present. The court ruled that the section, rather than being without standards, was subject to specific and very restricted standards in its application. Therefore, the claim of unconstitutionality of &sect; 10.53 failed. However, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court noted that parties at a hearing were entitled to an opportunity to be heard, to an opportunity to present and rebut evidence, to an impartial tribunal, and to a record made and adequate findings executed.

The inmate contended that, because he received only good, very good, and excellent ratings on his work reports during this period, he was automatically entitled to the 208 days' credit, and that no discretion was involved. The court noted that the record did not disclose what definitions prison officials gave the words &quot;good,&quot; &quot;very good,&quot; &quot;excellent,&quot; and &quot;meritorious,&quot; which served to distinguish the first three from the statutory word &quot;meritorious.&quot; The court held that under the provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(2)(d), even if the prison officials abused their discretion, the fact did not of itself remove the State's immunity from tort liability.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence consisting of marijuana that was seized from the ash tray of his automobile. The marijuana had been discovered by a man who was servicing defendant's car at a garage. The man, who was also an off-duty police officer notified the authorities and turned the evidence over to the officer that arrived on the scene. The circuit court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that under all the circumstances of the case the seizure of the marijuana discovered in the ash tray was a reasonable one and that the trial judge erred in suppressing the evidence. The court reasoned that the man who discovered the marijuana was not acting in his official capacity during the sequence of events at the garage, and therefore the discovery of the roach butts was not the product of an illegal search. The court further held that as an off-duty police officer, the man had a right to act against the offense in question by seizing the evidence and turning it over to the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dancer wearing only &quot;pasties&quot; and a G-String was observed engaging in bodily contact with a male patron in a bar owned by the licensee and operated by the permittee. The dancers were hired from an independent booking agent, but petitioners had control of their activities on the stage. The Commission issued a notice of violation and found that the licensee and the permittee had violated Or. Admin. R. 845-10-065(2) and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 472.180(5) by maintaining a lewd or disorderly establishment and by permitting disorderly conduct upon premises licensed by the Commission. The Commission then revoked the license of the licensee and issued a notice of warning to the permittee. On appeal, the court held that: (1) to permit the licensee to be held blameless for the acts of the permittee would be to permit the licensee and the permittee to evade the Commission's authority because the licensee was designed to be a successor to the business, (2) the dancers were the corporation's employees because the permittee had a right to control over them; and (3) the word &quot;lewd&quot; in &sect; 472.180(5) was not unconstitutionally vague because it indicated with sufficient specificity the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the Commission's order finding that the licensee and the permittee had maintained a disorderly establishment and permitted or suffered disorderly conduct upon the premises and remanded to the Commission to determine the sanctions imposed in light of such reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the statute, which made it a crime to sell an imitation drug to a peace officer, violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses in that it singled out those who sold to peace officers and was indefinite. The court first found that the legislative intent behind the statute was not to protect the public from the fraudulent sale of imitation drugs, but to protect against the costs and hazards involved in officers' buying imitation drugs. In light of the testimony before the legislature, the court stated, there was a reasonable basis for the legislature's singling out those who sold to peace officers. Next, the court held that under the Oregon statutes governing culpable mental states, including Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.095(2) and 161.115(2), although &sect; 167.232 dd not prescribe a culpable mental state, culpability was required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother signed a consent for the adoption of her twins. Subsequently, she filed a revocation of her consent and intervened in the proceedings and challenged the trial court's jurisdiction. The trial court ruled that she was estopped to withdraw her consent. The trial court granted the adoption petitions. On appeal, the court found that pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.326, consent of the mother was jurisdictional, and in the absence of her consent, the trial court was without power to proceed. The evidence revealed that the mother openly cohabited with the minors' father and that the couple held themselves out as husband and wife. As such, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41.360(30), the presumption that the couple was married was raised and there was nothing in the record to rebut the presumption. Thus, the court concluded that the evidence did not support the court's finding that the natural mother was unmarried to the father of the twins. This fact alone required the trial court to set aside the decree. Further, because the trial court proceeded without the mother's valid consent, its decree was not voidable; rather, it was void.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.875. The court held that the only possible basis for prohibiting defendant and his alibi witnesses from testifying would be the terms of the statute. As that statute was unconstitutional in so far as it did not require reciprocal discovery from the State, it was error to prohibit defendant and his alibi witnesses from testifying.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant and a companion were arrested for hitchhiking, the arresting officers conducted a search of defendant's person and found a plastic prescription bottle containing LSD. The sole issue at trial was whether defendant knew that the prescription bottle contained LSD. Defendant testified that his companion handed him the bottle shortly before they were arrested and that he was unaware of its contents. Defendant objected to the jury instruction that proof of unlawful possession of a dangerous drug was prima facie evidence of knowledge of its character pursuant to ORS 167.238. The court held that if ORS 167.238(1) was construed as creating a rebuttable presumption that shifted the burden of proof to defendant, it was void. However, if it merely stated that the jury could infer guilty knowledge from the fact of possession, the statute was valid because there was a rational connection between possessing something and having knowledge of the nature of the thing possessed. The court adopted the constitutional construction and held that it was error to instruct the jury that it had to find against defendant on the issue unless defendant's evidence disproved the prosecutor's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject of the burglary that defendant was charged with committing was a service station allegedly unlawfully entered by breaking a rear window of it. A piece of a concrete block was found lying with pieces of glass under the broken window, and it appeared that the block was the instrument used in the breaking. Inside the station, a locked drawer had been forced open by prying out the hasps into which the drawer lock fitted. Near the drawer was an arbor, on one end of which was found dried paint residue matching that of the drawer. Defendant was convicted of first degree burglary. He contended that there was insufficient proof that he used or was armed with a burglar tool. The court held that the concrete block and the arbor, under the evidence, were burglar tools as defined in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.235(2) as each was an article adapted to facilitating forcible entry into the premises or theft by physical taking therein. The court also held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.225 and the definition of a burglar tool in Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contributed to a municipal disability and retirement fund as required. Upon resigning after less than five years of service, the employee sought a refund of his contributions. Upon the denial of the refund claim, the employee filed suit, challenging the constitutionality of a city charter section providing that an employee with less than five years of service was not entitled to a refund of retirement fund contributions. In response, defendants argued that the employee failed to state an actionable claim and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction. On review, the court reversed the trial court's order sustaining defendants' demurrer. In reaching its conclusion, the court acknowledged that the complaint was inartfully worded. However, the court held that it was nonetheless sufficient to defeat a demurrer, even if it was subject to a motion for a more definite statement. Additionally, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction over the action as the claim was not subject to a charter provision establishing a time limit for review of municipal board decisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a theater that provided adult entertainment. Defendant offered to and did pay a man to engage in sex acts with a female before an audience on the stage of defendant's theater. Defendant claimed that the indictment did not state facts sufficient to constitute a crime, there was no evidence that defendant intended to promote prostitution, and that the trial court erred in refusing certain requested instructions. On review, the court had to affirm. There was nothing ambiguous about ORS 167.012(1)(d), ORS 167.002(2), or ORS 167.007. The court rejected defendant's argument that simply offering another money to engage in sexual acts with a third person was not prostitution as not being relevant. Defendant's argument that the language of ORS 167.012(1)(d) was unconstitutionally vague did not have sufficient merit to warrant discussion. It could have been reasonably inferred that defendant's promise to pay the man was at least one of the motivations behind the man's conduct and could have also been reasonably inferred that defendant's promise instituted, aided, or facilitated the act. The refused instructions were adequately covered in other instructions that were given.</SPAN></P>

The board filed a cross appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professor was hired as untenured academic faculty. Although a departmental committee soon recommended indefinite tenure for the professor, the school dean's advisory committee, acting on incomplete information furnished to them by the dean, unanimously voted against indefinite tenure. The dean sent a letter to the professor informing him that he would not be recommended for indefinite tenure, nor would he be recommended for another one-year term on the faculty as a nontenured professor. A dispute developed, eventually resulting in a letter from the university president formally notifying the professor of his termination. The court reversed and remanded the case on the issue of damages, but otherwise affirmed the professor's dismissal, holding that 1) the president's notice of termination was too late under former Or. Admin. R. L-3-F (1969) to terminate the professor's employment for the following academic year; 2) the professor thus had an expectation of continued employment that year; 3) this expectation was a property interest entitling the professor to a pretermination hearing; and 4) further proceedings were needed to set the professor's damages for that academic year.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the Commission's motion for involuntary nonsuit and the pond owners appealed. The court affirmed and found that the causes of action of the pond owners were based on the contention that the statutory authority for the acts of the Commission was either unconstitutional or inapplicable. There was no claim made that if the statutes were valid and applicable the pond owners would be entitled to damages. In one respect the court found that the pond owners alleged the Commission's acts were wrongful, and in another wilful; however, they never undertook under these allegations to produce evidence of malice or bad faith.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was serving three concurrent sentences in the Oregon State Penitentiary. The Superintendent transferred the prisoner to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and transported him to Marion, Illinois, pursuant to a contract under ORS 421.211 (Oregon) between the penitentiary and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Prior to the transfer the prisoner did not consent to the transfer nor did he have a hearing on the question of being transferred. At the time the prisoner was moved to Marion, Illinois, he had an habeas corpus proceeding pending in federal court. In that proceeding, the prisoner successfully moved for an order returning him to the Oregon State Penitentiary pending disposition of the proceeding. The prisoner contended that his present imprisonment in the Oregon State Penitentiary was illegal because the Superintendent relinquished jurisdiction over him by transferring him to the federal prison.

Both parties appealed, and the court affirmed the injunction against the shared time program and reversed the denial of an injunction against the released time program. Furnishing textbooks to parochial students violated &sect; 5; therefore, furnishing of teachers and teaching aids to a religious institution was likewise unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the court was whether a sentencing court had the authority to include among the conditions of probation a requirement that defendant repay attorney fees and investigator fees expended in his behalf at trial. The court answered the question in the affirmative and affirmed defendant's probation conditions. The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.665(1), (3) read together authorized a sentencing court to require a convicted defendant to repay certain costs if he was or would be able to pay them. The court reasoned that although the services of any attorney and investigator were used by and for defendant's benefit in the first instance, they were costs which the state or county had to pay if an indigent defendant were to be prosecuted. Thus, the court concluded that they were costs, which were assessable as part of the sentence in a proper case. The court also found that if there was no likelihood that defendant's indigency would end, a judgment for costs could not be imposed. The court further determined that the trial court's authority to revoke probation for nonpayment of costs did not suffer from any constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the mental element common to both &sect; 166.065(1)(a) and &sect; 166.065(1)(d) was not unconstitutionally vague, as the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the specific intent to harass, annoy or alarm. The court found that defendant did not meet the &quot;course of conduct&quot; required under &sect; 166.065(1)(d) since defendant's conduct was a single isolated transaction. However, the court found that &sect; 166.065(1)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague and its prohibition against slapping, kicking, etc., another person provided a man of common intelligence with adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The court held that defendant's acts of twice grabbing his ex-girlfriend and carrying and dragging her to his car constitute the crime of harassment under &sect; 166.065(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined the heir's decedent, the wife of the decedent who was the owner of record of the disputed assets, had no inheritable property because the decedent spouses' property was controlled by survivorship contracts and became vested in the husband at the moment the predeceased wife died, shortly before the husband's death. The trial court determined that &sect; 112.085 did not apply because the disputed property did not pass by intestate succession. The court on appeal affirmed the order of the trial court based on its determination that (1) &sect; 112.085 did not apply because the subject property passed by controlling contracts; (2) the Oregon Simultaneous Death Act, Or.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After separate jury trials, the Circuit Court of Multnomah County (Oregon) convicted defendant twice, on separate indictments, for the illegal sale of heroin. Defendant appealed the convictions. He contended that there was good cause, as a matter of law, for waiver of the notice requirements in the alibi statute,&nbsp;ORS &sect; 135.875.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the times that defendant's trials commenced, Oregon's criminal code was almost completely lacking in pretrial discovery procedures. Nonetheless, the prosecutor gave defense counsel free access to the files, and in particular, notified counsel of the dates and times that contended the illegal sales took place. Defendant did not timely file his notice of alibi as required by &sect; 135.875; consequently, it was rejected as a defense. He contended that there was good cause as a matter of law for waiver of the notice requirements in the alibi statute because there was no mandatory process by which he could learn of the date and time the offenses were allegedly committed. In affirming the convictions, the court held that (1) under Oregon law, the State had no duty to allege a specific time in an indictment unless time was a material ingredient in the crime charged, (2) a criminal defendant could not make time a material element of a crime by asserting an alibi defense, and (3) time was not a material element of the offenses that defendant was charged with committing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board alleged that the licensee had allowed her daughter to serve as a registered nurse in several nursing homes while the daughter was not licensed in the state, in violation of ORS 378.111(7), which prohibited acts derogatory to the standards of professional nursing. The licensee argued that the statute was vague and indefinite and that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The circuit court found that a motion to dismiss filed by the licensee should have been granted, and the court affirmed. The court held that conduct derogatory to the standards of professional nursing was an adequate statutory standard but that the Board's discretion was not without controls. There was insufficient evidence produced at the Board hearing to establish what activities constituted the duties of a registered nurse. The court found that the fact that the Board members felt that the licensee's conduct was improper did not provide the hearing with the requisite due process. In order to make judicial review of administrative decisions meaningful, the facts upon which such decisions were based had to appear on the record in all but the clearest cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The out-of-state student changed her address to her in-state uncle's home and enrolled in a state university.

The court affirmed. She challenged the relevant administrative rules on constitutional grounds which the court found lacked merit. Alternately, she argued the denial was not supported by the evidence. The court disagreed. Under the administrative rules, residence classification was first determined upon entry. A student was classified as resident if he was emancipated and domiciled in Oregon or unemancipated and his parents were domiciled in Oregon. Conversely, a student was classified nonresident if he or his parents were domiciled outside Oregon. A classification could be changed but the student had not sustained her burden of proving a change of her domicile.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from an order of remand from the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon) to be tried as an adult in the Marion County District Court for allegedly shooting a woman to death while in the course of and in furtherance of the crime of rape in the first degree. The issues were whether ORS 419.533(1) required establishing a factual basis for the petition at the hearing and the best interests of the child and the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the remand hearing defendant attempted to inquire into the basis of the information and belief on which the petition was filed. Objections were sustained on the basis that the sole question at the hearing was which system was better suited to protect the public and assist the child involved. The court was satisfied that the ruling was correct. The statute did not require establishing a factual basis for the petition at the hearing because it provided that the child could be remanded if he was alleged to have committed a criminal offense. The court agreed that defendant's contention of lack of probable cause was untimely. Once the juvenile court made its remand decision, adequate procedures existed in either court system to determine probable cause. Habeas corpus was also available to test the constitutionality of a detention. Defendant contended that the trial court should have explored further the possibility of treating defendant as a probation violator in California. However, the court agreed with the trial court's finding that the notion of processing a murder accusation as no more than an out-of-state juvenile probation violation was inconsistent with the public interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the previous court's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of disseminating obscene matter in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.151 based on his showing of film at his drive-in theater. The court affirmed that judgment on appeal, concluding that the indictment was sufficient because it essentially charged defendant in the language of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.151(1). The court also held that the subject film was legally obscene, noting that its dominant theme was to appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that it was patently offensive and lacked any redeeming social value, and that showing it was contrary to the community's prevailing moral standards and exceeded the customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matter with reference to ordinary persons. The court further determined that defendant waived the objection that he was not given fair notice that the location of the exhibition and the presence of minors and nonconsenting adults in the audience were vital elements of the offense because he failed to raise that point when the evidence of the viewing of the film by several minors standing outside the theater and by some nearby residents and passing motorists was presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company owned a chain of gasoline service stations and engaged station managers to handle daily operation. The company owned the equipment, provided supplies, and was responsible for utility bills. It carried public liability insurance on the stations, set gasoline prices, and determined standards of merchandising and advertising. The managers retained all income from the non-gasoline related services, and did not account to the company for those amounts. They hired their own helpers, set wages and conditions of employment, and paid withholding on them. Defendant found that the company was an employer, and a referee upheld the decision. The company sought review, arguing that its managers were not employees. The court affirmed, holding that the facts seemed to fall clearly within the ambit of &quot;service&quot; and &quot;remuneration.&quot; The company set the operating hours and gas prices at its stations, and it provided the property, equipment, and supplies for the gasoline business. Most managers were paid a set amount per month. With the liberal construction of the Act, the managers performed services for remuneration, and the company was an employer within the meaning of ORS 657.030.</SPAN></P>

The statute was clear on its face and did not unreasonably restrict any referendum power when balanced against the need to protect elects from fraud. No free speech right was impinged because the statute did not prohibit any person from circulating petitions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners' licenses were suspended without any prior hearing because of failure to file proof of future responsibility by buying insurance. The Division upheld the suspensions because it concluded that fault and indigency were irrelevant under the Law. On appeal, the court affirmed, upholding both the interpretation of and the constitutionality of the Law. Because the legislature did not intend fault to be a consideration in applying the Law, there was nothing violative of due process in excluding its consideration at the pre-suspension hearing. The legislature, by requiring all drivers involved in accidents regardless of fault to buy insurance, did not create a constitutionally-irrational classification. The court dismissed as frivolous the contention that the law was unconstitutional. There was no constitutional right for anyone to operate an automobile without insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The new rules changed the 6-months' requirement for eligibility for salary increases to 12-months. Following the hearing below PERB ruled that the challenged rule change was invalid because it was applied retroactively and thus unconstitutionally impaired vested contractual rights of the affected employes. The court reversed the decision of PERB and held as follows: 1) the employees did not have a vested contractual right in the terms of their jobs because the terms and conditions of civil service employment were fixed by statute and the regulations of the state agency, and not by &quot;contract&quot; between the public employer and the individual employee; 2) under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 240.180, the Division was authorized to promulgate the challenged rules; and 3) the PERB erred in ordering that the employees be considered for pay raises at the end of 6-months' service rather than at the end of the required 12-months' period.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the indictment did not allege with sufficient particularity facts constituting escape from the work release program in which he was an enrollee and that the statute defining the crime, former ORS 162.324, was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery. He was transferred from a correctional facility to work release so that he could attend classes. He left without permission and did not return. Defendant argued that his demurrer to the indictment and a motion for acquittal should have been allowed. Affirming, the court held that the offense was charged substantially in the words of the statute and sufficiently stated a crime to overcome the challenge of the demurrer. The court noted that ORS 162.324 provided that no person shall knowingly escape from official detention. Further, under ORS 144.500, which was part of the Work Release Program Act, an enrollee who was absent from his quarters, contrary to the rules applicable to him, committed an escape from official detention. ORS 144.490(2) unequivocally told defendant that he remained an inmate of a correctional facility. The court concluded that the terms of the penal statutes,&nbsp;ORS 144.490(2) and ORS 144.500, taken together, were sufficiently explicit to inform those who were subject to it what conduct on their part would render them liable to its penalties.</SPAN></P>

Five days later, the governor signed the legislative act amending the prior statute, which provided that releases executed prior to the effective date of the new statute could not be revoked. The mother brought a habeas corpus proceeding to have the trial court revoke her release for adoption and give her custody of her child. The trial court found that the mother was not entitled to the relief requested.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that he was not a &quot;convicted person&quot; within the meaning of ORS 166.270 (Oregon), which prohibited convicted felons from carrying concealable firearms, because his prior conviction for arson was pending on appeal at the time he was arrested. The court ruled that the pendency of an appeal did not affect defendant's status as a convicted person for purposes of the statute. The court further ruled that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit testimony that another person had admitted possessing the weapon because a defendant in a criminal case was not permitted to show that a third person had admitted that he committed the crime charged against the defendant. As to defendant's claim arising from an incident in which, during jury selection, a &quot;concerned&quot; juror had mentioned to other jurors defendant's conduct in writing down the jurors' names and addresses, the court determined that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial based on this incident where the evidence showed that the jurors had not been improperly influenced.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner made no allegation that his failure to appeal was due to incompetence of counsel or that he was uninformed of the existence of his right to a speedy trial. The court held that while the petition asserted the infringement of rights of constitutional dimension, that alone was insufficient to establish a &quot;substantial denial&quot; of constitutional rights under ORS 138.530(1)(a). Petitioner had to at least allege facts sufficient to show fraud, coercion, or such gross incompetence of counsel as to amount in law to a denial of the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment or that the issue sought to be determined in the post-conviction hearing could not reasonably have been raised had there been an appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A high school was burglarized. Electrical equipment was taken. Based on information received from an informant, police obtained a warrant that authorized a search of defendant's premises for two pieces of equipment.

The police also seized evidence that was unrelated to the burglary. The trial court suppressed only the evidence that was not related to the school burglary. In affirming, the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence that was related to the burglary that was seized under the valid search warrant. An illegal seizure of evidence not used against defendant at trial was not grounds for invalidating the entire search. There was sufficient evidence that defendant knew, or had good reason to know, that the property was stolen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child had been in foster care since he was less than a year old. The mother had a history of hospitalization in mental institutions. The circuit court terminated the mother's parental rights, and the mother made three assignments of error. The court only found it necessary to consider the mother's third assignment of error, which was that the evidence was insufficient to show that the mother was unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child. In affirming the termination of rights, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the circuit court's conclusion that the mother was unfit. A preponderance of the evidence supported the circuit court's findings that the mother was presently unable to physically and emotionally care for the child, that the mother's mental illness was a condition seriously detrimental to the child, and that the mother's condition would probably continue long enough to render improbable successful integration of the child into a family if the mother's rights were not terminated.</SPAN></P>

The employees argued that the circuit courts had jurisdiction over the cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees filed complaints in three circuit courts that sought judicial review of administrative decisions denying their claims for unemployment benefits. Subsequently, the appeals were consolidated. On review, the issue raised was which circuit court, if any had jurisdiction to review the administrative decisions. The employer argued that the circuit courts lost jurisdiction with the repeal of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657.285 by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.480 (2) (1971). The court held that statutes that preserved a right of appeal but changed the procedures therefor applied prospectively. Thus, the court reasoned that it could not presume that the legislature, by changing the forms of proceedings, intended to strike down or forbid any further progress in one already commenced. Therefore, the court held that the procedures prior to the repeal, including circuit court jurisdiction, applied to all cases of the type that were validly pending in a circuit court on the date in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of social protection entered an order for the patient's sterilization based on its determination that because of the mental illness or retardation of the patient, children produced by procreation of the patient would be neglected or dependent.

The patient asserted that there was insufficient evidence to affirm the determination of the board of social protection and that the statute unconstitutionally denied equal protection by discriminating against indigents. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision that ordered sterilization because it determined that there was sufficient evidence from the testimony of examining psychiatrists and the record of the foster care for the patient to support the determination. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 436.070 as a sterilization statute was constitutionally permitted because the state had the right to protect future generations and was not intended to apply unequally as it was intended to focus on the situation of the child rather than on the financial ability of the patient.</SPAN></P>

The city had charged defendant with violating &sect; 14.92.045 in a municipal court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The section at issue defined the crime of loitering. The court held that &sect; 14.92.045 of the Code of the City of Portland was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court held as follows: (1) the first two elements of the offense, as stated in &sect; 14.92.045, were clearly unconstitutionally vague because the terms &quot;loiter&quot; and &quot;prowl&quot; standing alone were so elastic that men of common intelligence necessarily had to guess their meaning; (2) these terms were not made more certain by the modifying phrase &quot;in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law abiding persons&quot; because what seemed usual to one law abiding person might have seemed quite unusual to another; and (3) the third element of the offense, that the loitering created justifiable alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity, was also vague because there was no distinction between an ordinance that permitted an officer to arrest when conduct suggested to him that a suspect was about to commit an unspecified crime, and the ordinance in question that permitted an officer to arrest when conduct created &quot;justifiable alarm,&quot; since the officer believed the suspect was about to commit an unspecified crime.</SPAN></P>

Upon the circuit court's finding that there was failure of proof as to premeditation and malice, it removed the first and second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter offenses from the jury's consideration and submitted to it the included offense of involuntary manslaughter. The circuit court entered a judgment of conviction based upon the jury's verdict against defendant as to the involuntary manslaughter offense. The court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that the circuit court erred in admitting into evidence all of a statement under the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule, which specifically referred to a prior instance in which defendant had pointed a gun at the deceased and which also contained the deceased's declaration that she was afraid after that incident. The court stated that the part of the statement that referred to the fact that defendant had previously pointed a gun at the deceased constituted evidence of another misdemeanor crime or felony, and that the prejudicial effects of such statement outweighed its value and required a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the power company argued that the city was not a municipal corporation of the State duly and lawfully organized and chartered under the laws of the State. The court held that the city was validly incorporated and that its charter was lawfully enacted, noting that the power company failed to overcome the presumption that official duty had been regularly performed. The court also held that the general grant of powers in the city charter conferred upon the city the sum total of intramural powers available to municipalities in Oregon. The court further held that the ordinance did not violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States and Oregon Constitutions because there was a reasonable distinction between an electric utility and other utilities operating within the city.</SPAN></P>

The city annexed certain territories lying within the boundaries of each district under the authority of the Local Government Boundary Commissions law, Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main question as to each plaintiff was whether it was an &quot;affected district.&quot; The park and recreation district urged the court to define the term &quot;affected district&quot; broadly. The court concluded that the legislature did not intend to give such districts the power to block annexation of land to a city after the annexation was approved by a boundary commission and that the city was correct when it interpreted the &quot;automatic withdrawal&quot; provision of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.510(1) as not requiring a second petition seeking to withdraw from a park and recreation district. The court found that a district was an &quot;affected district&quot; when a separate petition for withdrawal addressed to and approved by the local government boundary commission was necessary to withdraw land. Domestic water supply corporations were specifically excluded from the &quot;automatic withdrawal&quot; provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.510(1); therefore, the city was required to file separate petitions and obtain approval to withdraw territory from the water districts. As an affected district, the water districts had the power to call a district-wide &quot;remonstrance election&quot; under the provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.505.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance made an act of driving criminal if it was both negligent and dangerous. When a statute was capable of constitutional construction, courts were obligated to give it a constitutional interpretation. The court did not construe the questioned ordinance as meaning that any act of driving no matter how careful and prudent was criminal if it in fact endangered or would be likely to endanger any person or property, but its interpretation meant that an act of driving was criminal if it was both negligent and dangerous.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the convictions, the court held that (1) the seizure of the LSD and the drug paraphernalia was valid because other evidence of the crime under investigation can be seized, even though not described in a search warrant, if it was discovered in the course of a search no broader in scope than that authorized by the warrant, (2) the warrant was not overbroad merely because its scope sought evidence of illegal narcotics, and (3) there was no error in refusing to permit counsel to question the author of the warrant affidavit on whether the affidavit was false because counsel never claimed that the affidavit was false.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for robbery and filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized during three separate searches. The issue before the court was whether defendant's landlord had the authority to consent to a warrantless search of defendant's apartment. The court stated that in most cases the warrantless search of leased premises with only the permission of the landlord was unconstitutional. The State contended that the landlord could grant permission to search the premises because the tenant was a tenant at sufferance and his continued possession was wrongful. The state argued that the landlord's rights in the premises were superior to that of the defendant. The court held that a tenant of leased residential premises whose landlord has acquiesced in the late payment of rent then due and who did not know or have reason to know that the landlord has terminated his tenancy, continued to have a reasonable expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some officers were on a public street, smelled the odor of a petroleum derivative through a partially open car window, looked in with the aid of a flashlight, and saw the fire bombs in a beer case. They then entered the car and seized the contraband. Defendant contended on appeal that: Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 480.070 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; the trial judge improperly denied his pretrial motion to suppress certain evidence obtained by an allegedly illegal search and seizure; and the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial, based on allegations that he was denied a fair trial by statements of the prosecutor and a witness. In affirming the judgment, the court found that defendant failed to show that &sect; 480.070 was unconstitutional as it was applied to him and that the possession of beer bottles filled with gasoline having rags sticking out of the tops is clearly proscribed by &sect; 480.070 and constitutionally subject to proscription. The court also found plan view observation aided by a light was not a search, therefore denial of suppression was proper. Further, the court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court's decision to deny a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Benton County (Oregon), which denied his motion to suppress evidence seized during the execution of a search warrant and convicted him of illegal possession of narcotics in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 474.020. Defendant contended that since the police did not make an announcement of their identity and purpose before entering the apartment the search was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer knocked but did not announce his identity or purpose. He directed the manager to unlock the door. Defendant was in the apartment. The search that followed produced a substantial amount of illegal drugs. The trial court convicted defendant of illegal possession of narcotics. The court reversed and remanded. The police officer's belief that the apartment was vacant was not justified. Many people take a moment or two to answer the door. The officers had not seen anybody come or go from the apartment that Sunday afternoon. The court concluded that since the police officer's belief was unwarranted the search was in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 133.290. Nothing in the record suggested that there was an easily disposable amount of narcotics. Since the required showing to invoke the destruction-of-the-evidence exception was not made, the instant entry without announcement of purpose violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. The fruits of an unconstitutional search were inadmissible. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress and defendant's conviction. The court remanded.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant conceded he was intoxicated at the relevant time and place, but his contention was that his chronic alcoholism was a disease and that it was, therefore, cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to convict him for the crime of public drunkenness. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that while punishing an alcoholic merely for being intoxicated would be unconstitutional, the offense in question contained the additional element of being intoxicated in public and, therefore, that the specific question became whether it was a symptom of the disease of alcoholism to be drunk in public as distinguished from drunk elsewhere. The court held that the record was inadequate on this question and that although there was extensive expert medical testimony that defendant was unable to control his drinking, there was little testimony as to defendant's powers to abstain from appearing in public while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then attempted to testify in his own behalf that he was at a movie with the witness, but the court also struck that testimony as violative of the statute. On review, he argued that he was compelled to testify against himself, that he was denied his right to confrontation, that he was denied the right to testify, and that he was denied the right of compulsory process. The court found no self-incrimination violation by requiring adequate notice of an alibi defense. The court refused to address any claim of right to reciprocal discovery because defendant had not demonstrated any prejudice. Defendant confused his right to testify under Or. Const. art.

Defendant claimed that the circuit court erred in overruling his objection to the taking of further testimony because the complaint did not state a crime and that he was improperly found guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant used a United States flag as a cover on the front seat of his pick up truck. As a result of several anonymous complaints to a district attorney regarding the use of a flag as a seat cover, defendant was charged with a violation of ORS 162.720(4). Following his conviction in a district court, defendant appealed to the circuit court. Defendant objected to the taking of further testimony on the ground that a crime was not stated in the complaint. Defendant claimed that the use of the flag as a seat cover was not done &quot;publicly&quot; within the meaning of ORS 162.720(4) and that his use of the flag did not cause or tend to cause a breach of peace. The circuit court overruled the objection and defendant was convicted. Defendant sought review, alleging that ORS 162.720(4) violated his First Amendment rights in addition to other grounds. On further review, the court affirmed, holding that the flag was used publicly because the truck was open to public view, ORS 162.720(4) did not require an intent to defile a flag or an actual or threatened breach of peace, and defendant was not entitled to raise a constitutional issue for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion for post-conviction relief was denied. On review, defendant argued that &sect; 137.090 was unconstitutional because he had a constitutional right to see the report prior to sentencing. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court reasoned that the legislative intent of the statute was to make disclosure discretionary with the trial court. The court could find no federal or state case law holding that defendant in a criminal case had a constitutional right to see a presentence investigative report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment rendered by the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which found him guilty of committing an illegal abortion under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 435.455. Defendant claimed that the indictment did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a crime and that the abortion statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 435.405 to 435.495, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged defendant with using a fluid in the body of a pregnant woman with intent to terminate the pregnancy. The court noted that even though defendant did not demur to the indictment, he could challenge the indictment on appeal on the grounds that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a crime. However, the court held that the indictment was sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what he was charged with and to prepare a defense. Because defendant was not a licensed physician nor assisting a licensed physician, the indictment did not need to negate the possibility that the abortion may have been lawful. Further, the court determined that defendant could not attack the constitutionality of the abortion statute because he lacked standing because he was not a physician. Regardless of the constitutionality of statutes that forbade licensed physicians from performing abortions, there could be no question of the constitutionality of a statute that prohibited unlicensed persons from performing abortions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an insurance agent, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Lane County (Oregon), which affirmed an order by respondent, the Insurance Commissioner of the Department of Commerce, who suspended petitioner's license as an insurance agent for one year for violating Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 736.815(3) - (5), by using unfair trade practices in his letters to prospective customers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a hearing, respondent found that petitioner's letters contained misleading representations as to the financial condition of a certain insurance company. Respondent concluded that the petitioner's action constituted unfair trade practices under the insurance law, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 736.815(3) - (5), and that his license should be suspended for one year pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 736.465(1)(e). Petitioner argued that the statutes under which his license was suspended were unconstitutional or restricted his freedom of speech and that he had been denied due process of law. On appeal, the court affirmed respondent's decision to suspend petitioner's license, holding that the order was based upon substantial evidence, and that petitioner's objections related to matters placed within the discretion of respondent by the legislature. Section 736.815 provided that circulating letters with respect to the business of insurance, which were untrue, deceptive or misleading, was an unfair and deceptive act or practice. Section 736.465(1)(e) provided that an agent, who violated any provision of the insurance laws, might have his license suspended for one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed, holding that adequate procedural safeguards were provided for and exercised by petitioner so that there was no denial of due process. Petitioner's freedom of speech was not unconstitutionally restricted. Respondent, with authority and responsibility entrusted to him, found that petitioner did violate the laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, Linn County (Oregon) conviction of lewdly fondling and manipulating the private parts of a nine-year-old female child contrary to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.227. Defendant claimed error in (1) allowing the child victim to testify; (2) overruling a demurrer on the ground of vagueness of the statute; and (3) denial of his motion for acquittal on the ground of insufficient competent evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for lewd behavior because the child victim was not competent to testify and that the corroborative evidence of her brother was also insufficient. Defendant also contended that &sect; 167.227 was unconstitutionally vague because the words &quot;lewdly fondling and manipulating the private parts of a child under 18&quot; were indefinite and did not give adequate notice of prohibited conduct. The court rejected his arguments and affirmed the conviction. The court found that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44.030, the decision to permit a child under 10 to testify was discretionary with the trial court. The statute was not vague because anyone of ordinary intelligence could understand words that had plain meaning and when read together gave adequate notice of proscribed conduct. The victim's testimony established a prima facie case and was adequately corroborated by her brother who was in another room of the trailer home at the time the crime occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on the inducement charge, the sodomy charge, and on a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

Defendant was re-indicted on the inducement charge and the sodomy charge. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. The court reversed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court held that the statute on which the contributing charge was based had been declared unconstitutional, that re-indictment was unnecessary, and that a motion to dismiss the contributing charge would have accomplished the same result. The court also held that the State of Oregon could not evade the purpose of ORS 134.510 et seq. by a process of re-indictment and dismissal. The court further held that defendant's request for additional counsel caused no delay, that the delay was caused by the State's request for a hearing and the re-indictment, and that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that mandamus was the proper remedy and that the trial court did not err in refusing to hear evidence and testimony offered by the district as to the reasons for the firefighters' dismissal because hearing such evidence would have been the function of the civil service board, if one had been created. The district had no authority to discharge the firefighters except for the manner provided in the Act, and therefore, the firefighters were entitled to the benefits they would have received under Or.

The court noted that the guardian did not assert that the insurance agency was authorized by the governing body of the recreation district or any of its officers or employes to receive claims for damages on its behalf. Because the guardian failed to give notice to the recreation district within 45 days of the occurrence of the injury, as required by &sect; 30.275(1), the trial court did not err in dismissing the action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for knowingly and wilfully cruelly mistreating and maltreating a child under the age of 16 years. The indictment listed three counts with different facts supporting each count. The trial court sustained the demurrers filed by defendants against the indictments, which claimed that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.650 was unconstitutional on its face because it was void for vagueness and failed to meet the due process requirement of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The State appealed. The court reviewed the definitions for the several of the words contained within the statute and found them to sufficiently define the prohibited behavior without further explanation. Therefore, defendants were properly apprised of the charges against them and the jury could have resolved the issues without misunderstanding the nature of the prohibited behavior. The court found that the demurrers were improperly sustained.</SPAN></P>

While in that capacity, he answered a call to defendant's apartment where defendant's wife was found wounded. The wife later died, and a second officer obtained a key to the apartment. Without defendant present and without a warrant, the second officer gave the first officer the key, he went to defendant's apartment, searched it, and found a weapon. The trial court found that the officer had the right to search because the officer was also a deputy medical investigator who had the authority to enter and search the apartment. The appellate court reversed, finding a Fourth Amendment violation. Under the Chimel zone test and related case law, the police had probable cause to believe that a crime was committed in order to make the search. However, the police failed to establish the second prong of the test. There were no special circumstances to dispense with obtaining a warrant. Nor was the search justified under the medical examiner statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 146.450.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of a judgment order of the Juvenile Department of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which terminated their parental rights to their child under the provisions of ORS &sect; 419.523(2)(a). Respondent, the State of Oregon, was the opposing party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was illegitimately born to the mother. Two months later, on complaint about child neglect, a petition alleging dependency was filed in the juvenile court by police. The child had been continuously in foster care from that time. The parents were married after the child was born. They never paid anything toward the child's support. The father was unable to keep a job for more than a few days. Their sporadic visits with the child had a traumatic effect on her. The juvenile court terminated the parents' rights. On appeal, the court found that the statutory authority for the court's order was not unconstitutionally vague. The juvenile court's decision was based upon the words &quot;condition or conduct&quot; used together. When the court viewed ORS &sect; 419.523(2)(a) in the light of ORS &sect;&sect; 419.474 and 419.476, the requisite specificity was apparent. The welfare department had cared for the child and worked with the parents for four years. The needs of the child indicated that there was urgency to get her integrated into a family. Under the circumstances, consideration of permanent commitment was in order under ORS &sect; 419.523. The evidence substantiated the juvenile court's findings.</SPAN></P>

The court found authority upholding the constitutionality thereof and also noted that defendant failed to cite any cases invalidating acts for overbreadth of title.

The trial court held that there was no compliance with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.070, which required an affidavit showing good cause as a prerequisite for such a postponement. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to postpone. Additionally, defendant assigned as error an instruction, which defined a false writing. No exception was taken to the instruction, therefore the court did not consider the alleged error. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court should have set aside the conviction on defendant's motion because Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Lane County (Oregon) convicting him of failure to support his child, contrary to ORS 167.605. He contended that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to elect a 60-day period of time during which the offense occurred which was different than the date alleged in the indictment, and in overruling objections to the cost bill requiring payment as a condition of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment alleged the crime occurred on or about December 11, 1968. After the evidence was in, the State elected the dates from August 1, 1968, to October 1, 1968. Defendant contended that this violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Art I, &sect; 11 of the Oregon Constitution because time was a material ingredient in the case. On review, the court rejected the argument because defendant had not demonstrated that any prejudice to his defense was caused by the election or that a precise time period was a material ingredient of the offense. The record showed the dates on which the State relied were included in the testimony of its first witness. No objection was made at that time and no continuance was requested. Also, under both ORS 137.200 and ORS 137.205, the trial court properly assessed costs and court-appointed attorney fees against defendant, except for the costs of a witness who did not appear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to deduct costs for a witness who did not appear and affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's counsel moved to suppress evidence deriving therefrom because he had demanded the right to be present at the time of taking the hairs, but they were taken without his presence. This motion was denied and defendant appealed from the order of denial. The court held that defendant wanted to confer with his attorney and was given little or no opportunity to do so; he was a known alcoholic whose weakness was played upon by the detectives and it was claimed that taking drugs after giving the admissions was the final reason for his incoherence at the police station, but the proof was questionable, to say the least. The court saw no reason why other body hairs for study could not be taken with counsel present. The court concluded that the delay occasioned by the appeal, authorized under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.060(4), was not unduly long, or a delay which was prohibited by either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Both of the charges were for violation of the portion of the ordinance relating to opacity. Defendant alleged that the ordinance was void because it violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Code provided that a person should not discharge into the atmosphere any air contaminant for certain periods that was of such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal to or greater than a shade designated as No. 2 on the Ringelmann Chart, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. A witness testified that No. 2 on that chart was equal to 40 percent opacity. He stated that he was able to determine the percentage of opacity without the necessity of having a Ringelmann Chart before him while making observations of the smoke emitted from the company's smokestack. On appeal, the court adopted the trial judge's opinion with respect to the company's constitutional objections. The trial judge noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had declared that a state or an authorized municipality could declare the emission of dense smoke a nuisance and subject to restraint as such and that the harshness of such legislation, short of a merely arbitrary enactment, was not a valid constitutional objection. The trial judge also found the ordinance provided a standard of guilt ascertainable to persons of common intelligence because the Ringelmann Chart was an easily understood standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony murder for the death of a woman who died as a result of a fall that occurred while minor accomplices were attempting to steal her purse. Defendant was convicted of manslaughter as a result of the death. On appeal, defendant charged that the trial court erred by its denial of his motion for a new trial based upon a claim of newly discovered evidence. The evidence in question was a statement from the minor boy involved by which he changed his description of an earlier theft involving defendant. The court found there had been consistent contradiction in the boy's testimony. The statement was not likely to change the result if a new trial was granted. The evidence was merely impeaching, contradictory of other evidence, and patently untrustworthy; thus, the court found the denial was not erroneous. Defendant also contended a police report containing relevant evidence was suppressed. The court found this testimony was also contradictory. During the trial, defense counsel was aware the victim could not sufficiently describe the minor boy involved in the thefts and the suppression of a police report that demonstrated this was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased less than $ 75 worth of merchandise using a stolen credit card.

On appeal of her conviction, defendant alleged that she was improperly convicted of &sect; 165.115, a felony, even though her crime also violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.295(6), which prevented unlawful use of a credit card. Section 165.295(6) was a misdemeanor when less than $ 75 was involved. Defendant contended that the credit-card statutes pre-empted the general provisions of the criminal code. In affirming the conviction, the court ruled that the Oregon credit-card statutes did not pre-empt the more general criminal laws merely because they overlapped some of them. The court also ruled that as long as there was any reasonable basis for distinguishing between two criminal statutes, there could be no constitutional objection to the fact that a particular defendant's unlawful acts constituted a violation of both statutes. The mere fact that a person's criminal activity violated two statutes, one defining a felony and the other a misdemeanor, did not confer upon him a constitutional right to be prosecuted for the misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which, after defendant waived his right to trial by jury, found him guilty of possessing a motor vehicle with altered serial number in violation of ORS &sect; 481.990(6) and possessing a stolen motor vehicle in violation of ORS &sect; 481.990(5). The trial court had overruled defendant's demurrers to each count and denied his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that his demurrer to the count dealing with possession of a stolen motor vehicle should have been sustained on the ground that the indictment was unconstitutionally vague because, rather than charging him with possessing the vehicle in question &quot;knowing&quot; it was stolen, it charged him in the language of ORS &sect; 481.990(5) with &quot;having reason to believe&quot; the vehicle was stolen. His argument was that the phrase &quot;having reason to believe&quot; was not sufficient to charge a crime because it did not require guilty knowledge as a pre-requisite to a finding of guilty. The indictment was substantially in the language of &sect; 481.990(5), and the demurrer was properly overruled if the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The real issue, then, was the validity of &sect; 481.990(5). Affirming, the court held in part that the demurrer was properly overruled because &sect; 481.990(5) was capable of constitutional construction. The State did have the right to go to trial on the indictment as drawn because the rule was that a court would read a knowledge requirement into a statute if necessary to preserve its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The trial court valued the condemned land as a self-sufficient economic unit. The court affirmed that the &quot;before and after&quot; method was difficult in a partial taking, especially where the land taken was commercially valuable as a self-sufficient economic unit. Special benefits could not be offset against the value of the land taken.

In post-conviction proceedings, the prisoners contended that they were entitled to relief because the supreme court's reasoning, which led to the declaration of unconstitutionality of the third provision of the questioned statute, applied with equal force to the first provision under which they were convicted. The trial court granted the relief sought and the State appealed. The court held that the language in &sect;167.210, under which they were convicted, was also unconstitutional because the language of &quot;any person responsible for, or by any act encouraging, causing or contributing to the delinquency of such child&quot; was vague and failed to state which acts would be deemed criminal.

The court concluded that the trial court retained jurisdiction to correct the transcript, even until the disposition of the cause by the appellate court. Finally, defendant contended that his concurrent sentences of life imprisonment for armed robbery and 10 years for assault with a dangerous weapon constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that the applicable test was whether a given sentence was so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the conscience of fair-minded men.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers contended that the tax was discriminatory and therefore violated the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend.

In affirming, the court held that Or. Laws ch. 643 (Act) was valid, the formation of the district complied with the Act, and the district's ordinance that levied the tax was valid. The court found that: (1) the Act did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the district board; (2) the Act did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 32 by imposing a tax without first submitting it to the voters of the district; (3) due process and home rule constitutional rights were not denied; and (4) the levy of taxes by an appointive and unapportioned board did not deny equal protection under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County, (Oregon), which, after conducting a hearing, revoked defendant's probation that had been imposed after he had been found guilty by a jury of advocating the commission of a felony under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.330. Defendant had not appealed from the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the revocation of his probation and claimed that the statute under which he was convicted, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.330, was unconstitutional. At the time of his conviction, defendant did not appeal the judgment. On review, the court held that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.070, an appeal from an order placing defendant on probation had to be taken within 60 days after the order appealed from was made. The court also found that there was no showing that the question of the constitutionality of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.330 was raised at trial. Defendant's assignment of error was governed by the rule that, in the absence of unusual circumstances, which the court did not find, the court was not going to consider questions not raised and preserved in the trial court. Finally, the court held that defendant's argument that the trial court's action revoking his probation was arbitrary and capricious was without merit. The summary hearing provided by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.550 was essentially an informal trial, and the trial court was not bound by strict rules of evidence, which applied in criminal or civil trials. Probation was not a matter of right, but a matter of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the revocation of probation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, claiming that his conviction should be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his conviction should be vacated because of the unconstitutionality of the statute and because the trial court erred in accepting his guilty plea when the allegations set forth in the indictment did not contain facts sufficient to state a crime. The court would not consider either of defendant's assignments of error because the only statutory provision permitting an appeal by defendant after entry of a plea of guilty was ORS 138.050. The only question which could be raised in an appeal after a guilty plea was whether the trial court imposed an excessive fine or excessive, cruel or unusual punishment not proportionate to the offense. The court was prohibited from considering any other question. Defendant's remedy, if any, was found in the Post-Conviction Relief Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the victim's mother was permitted to testify to a phone conversation with defendant, an older man, despite her admission she did not know him.

On review, defendant contended that these actions amounted to reversible error. The court disagreed. The court found that previous telephone conversations with defendant provided enough circumstantial evidence for defendant's identity to be a jury question. Although the prosecutor's statements referring to evidence not in the record were improper, the court found no prejudicial error because he was immediately corrected by the trial judge who admonished the jury to try the case on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in a work-related accident that took place in another county. The employee was also a resident of the other county at the time of the accident. The Board closed the employee's claim, and the employee appealed. The employer filed a motion to quash the appeal. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.298, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the employee's appeal. The accident occurred in another county, and the employee resided in that county. The court refused to reconsider its determination in a prior case that the geographic provisions of &sect; 656.298 were matters of jurisdiction and not venue. The court also rejected the employee's contention that its construction of &sect; 656.298 was unconstitutional because it did not allow judicial review to non-residents workers employed by an Oregon employer and injured while out of the state.  Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.126(1) afforded benefits, including the right to judicial review, to such workers. Finally, neither Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.060 nor Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was accused of violating a Portland city ordinance by committing a disorderly act, which disturbed the peace and quiet of the city. He was charged with lewdly exposing his private parts on a public street and pleaded guilty in municipal court without benefit of counsel. Before the case was disposed of, he obtained counsel and moved to withdraw his guilty plea. The municipal court denied the motion, suspended sentence, and placed the petitioner on probation for one year. The petitioner commenced a proceeding for post-conviction relief in the circuit court, claiming he was wrong-fully deprived of his right to have counsel in municipal court, that his guilty plea was neither voluntary nor informed, and that the city ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. He appealed from the adverse judgment of the circuit court. The court held that it could not consider the case on the merits because the case was moot. The petitioner was not imprisoned. Even his one-year probation expired long before the case was at issue in the court. This holding was required by ORS 138.560(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured on October 30, 1963. He was awarded workmen's compensation. Later seeking increased compensation for aggravation of his injury, he elected to proceed under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law (Law) which was enacted in 1965 and became operative January 1, 1966. The amount of his award was increased, and attorney fees were allowed. The Department did not pay the newly awarded compensation pending appeal as required by Or. Rev.

The hearing officer made a finding that the failure to pay the increased award pending the court review was unreasonable and awarded claimant a penalty, together with attorney fees. The Board affirmed the order, but the circuit court overruled the decision of the Board. Finding that the claimant had properly brought himself within the terms of Oregon Workmen's Compensation Law &sect; 43(4), and that the section allowed for the relief sought, the court held that the claimant was entitled to the subject penalties.</SPAN></P>

In lieu of rent, the taxpayer agreed to keep the leased land and an adjacent area free from weeds. The county disqualified the leased area from exempt status and assessed the lessee for property taxes under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.060 (1989 Replacement Part). The agency appealed to the Department, claiming the land was exempt. The Department found the lease was taxable under &sect; 307.060, but it also found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.110 (1989 Replacement Part) imposed a lesser burden on lessees of state-owned property, thereby making the assessment unconstitutional. The agency had standing to appeal an assessment of taxes against the property. The imposition of a heavier tax burden on those who dealt with one sovereign than was imposed on those who dealt with the other was not justified by significant differences between the two classes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.583(3), the taxpayers had a 60-day time limit within which to file their petition. In challenging the urban renewal tax, the taxpayers, who did not timely file their petition, alleged that because the &quot;ten&quot; requirement in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.583(1) was unconstitutional, so was the 60-day time limit. The court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the cities and counties, finding that the taxpayers failed to comply with the 60-day filing period. The court first held that the requirement in &sect; 305.583(1) that 10 taxpayers were needed to file a petition violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution because due process demanded that the remedy afforded a taxpayer be available to an individual, especially where the remedy was the exclusive one. The court rejected the taxpayers' argument that they did not have adequate notice of the 60-day time limit for filing their petition, holding that the laws were published in July and August. Moreover, the 60-day period began when the tax statements were mailed to the taxpayers. The court held that the tax statements complied with the law.</SPAN></P>

The challenging statutes required that 10 or more taxpayers had to combine to file a refund petition. The taxpayer argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it ignored his individual rights. The court granted summary judgment for the taxpayer. The court held that he &quot;ten&quot; of ORS 305.583(1) was a condition that violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and must be deemed void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property consisted of two adjacent improved lots fronting a city street.

The property owner argued that the special assessment was not a &quot;local improvement&quot; within the meaning of Or. Const. art.

First, the court determined that it had jurisdiction and, noting that the &quot;10&quot; requirement of &sect; 305.583(1) was unconstitutional, reasoned that the constitutional rights to challenge assessments were individual and remedies therefrom could not be conditioned upon group action. Next, the court found that the owner failed to show that the assessment was arbitrary and a plain abuse and reasoned that &quot;local improvement,&quot; within the meaning of Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department concluded that it could only refund taxes only after a court of last resort held that the law under which the tax was levied was invalid and as it agreed the law was invalid, there was no justiciable issue. The court rejected defendant's motion for summary judgment on the basis that there was no justiciable issue. The court observed that it was the final and exclusive judicial authority for a hearing and determination of all questions of law and fact arising under the state laws and that it was a trial court, not an appellate court of review. In sum, the court disregarded the Department's decisions so that neither party was limited to arguments or claims previously asserted to the Department. The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.127 under which the taxpayers paid the taxes was unconstitutional. As the taxpayer's claims for refunds were governed by Or. Rev.

The United States Supreme Court then ruled that state laws imposing a tax on federal retirement income, but exempting state retirement income, violated 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11 and intergovernmental immunity. The court granted and denied in part the parties' summary judgment motions. The court held that the taxpayers were entitled to a refund of the amounts paid in response to the 1992 assessment, but that the self-assessed taxes paid under the original return should not be refunded. The court held that Oregon's statutory scheme provided taxpayers with a predeprivation hearing consistent with due process requirements, as the appeal statutes in Or. Rev.

While their administrative appeal was pending, the husband and wife concluded that none of their 1987 federal retirement income should have been subjected to taxation by Oregon and filed an amended 1987 return.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband worked as a teacher in Alaska and moved to Oregon after retirement. Retirement benefits from Alaska were taxed in Oregon, although the same benefits would have been exempt from taxation by ORS 316.6801(1)(c) (Oregon) if received from Oregon. The taxpayers included the retirement benefits in their taxable income but later sought a refund on the basis that &sect; 316.6801(c)(1) was unconstitutional. The Department denied a refund, which decision the court sustained. A classification based solely on the source of retirement benefits did not violate equal protection because there was a rational predicate for the classification. The purpose of &sect; 316.680(1)(c) was to reduce payroll costs to the State of Oregon. The court stated that intergovernmental tax immunity was not involved because the taxpayers, as Oregon residents, were not subject to the sovereign powers of Alaska. Further, the Privileges and Immunities Clause did not apply because the taxpayers were not residents of another state.

Stat. &sect; 305.583 but the court found the issue was one of substantial public concern. The court found that the property tax limits imposed by Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11b establish a constitutional boundary. When government hands reach across that boundary for more taxes, the exaction is an unlawful taking of property. The legislature limited a taxpayer's right to protect this constitutional boundary under the statutes being examined. By requiring, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.583, that ten taxpayers join together to file a challenge to a tax, the court found that the statute was unconstitutional. Taxes were payable by individually, not as collective obligations of groups of taxpayers and a taxpayer could not compel others to join him or her in challenging the taxes assessed nor contest the taxes for others without their authorization. The requirement that they join diminished individual rights significantly, possibly depriving some taxpayers of any remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers excluded federal pension income from the tax return and requested a refund. The Department held the federal pension income taxable, and the taxpayers appealed. The Department moved for summary judgment. Subsequently, the Oregon Supreme Court decided a specified case, which the Department conceded entitled the taxpayers to a refund for the subject tax year. Denial of the motion for summary judgment was therefore warranted. The proposed judgment of remand did not provide for interest on the refund, which interest the taxpayers claimed they were entitled to. The taxpayers contended that ORS 305.765 and 305.775, the statutes governing refunds, were unconstitutional. The Oregon Supreme Court expressly found in the specified case that ORS 305.765 applied to refund claims made by virtue of a statute being held invalid and that the remedy provided by it did not violate the Due Process Clause. The court also held that the state was entitled to choose to provide for interest on a refund as it had in ORS 305.775 or to grant refunds without interest as it had in ORS 305.765.</SPAN></P>

Respondent's ordinance assumed that &quot;property&quot; meant unimproved land. However, Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11b did not make that assumption. Property was not just land.

The taxpayer contended that the true cash value of the property was no more than $ 1,471,000. Defendant department of revenue considered the &quot;intangibles&quot; of goodwill, going concern, management, and work force in place, in the assessed value of the real property for property tax purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held, regarding goodwill, that if goodwill existed in connection with tangible, real or personal property, it arose not from the property but from the business operation of the property. And, even where goodwill was associated with property such as hotels, goodwill was an intangible asset that was not subject to taxation. Secondly, regarding going concern, the court held that the statutes subjecting the taxpayer's property to taxation did not tax going-concern value. They taxed true cash or market value. And, although going-concern value in a broad sense was used in taxing the property of utilities, it was not used in Oregon's general property tax statutes. Finally, regarding management and work force in place, the court held that it should not have been deducted from any estimate of market value.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Oregon tax system, which was identical to that of Michigan, was also unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's decision was not retroactive, however. The court noted that the State of Oregon was surprised by the Supreme Court's decision. It also found that the tax was legitimate until the law was changed by the new decision, so applying it retroactively would do nothing to further the law. The court noted that the Supreme Court held that there had to be equality in the taxation, which could be accomplished by refunding taxes paid on federal pensions or by collecting tax on the previously exempt state and local pensions. The court concluded that the decision applied to Oregon's income tax scheme only prospectively. Because the taxpayer sought refunds of prior years' taxes, she was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

Comparable lots in the same subdivision were assessed at values lower than the taxpayers' because of their ownership under ORS 308.205(3) (Oregon).

The statute assumed that the lots were for sale, but did not make it a requirement. The lots also were not required to be owned by developers. In essence, the statute directed valuation based on ownership interests rather than the property's actual value, which presented significant uniformity problems.

The court awarded the taxpayer attorney fees. Although he sued in his name only and his complaint sought relief only for himself, the relief sought was declaratory in nature. Plaintiff succeeded in stopping the collection of unconstitutional taxes, thereby benefiting all property taxpayers. Because the taxpayer prevailed on only one of three claims, the court found that he was not entitled to recover attorney fees for work performed on issues that he lost.</SPAN></P>
