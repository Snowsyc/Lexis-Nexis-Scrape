<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Municipal Court of the City of San Diego (California) convicting him of depositing advertising matter on motor vehicles parked on streets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant placed advertisements for his auto shop on the windshields of parked cars. Defendant contended that the ordinance prohibiting such behavior violated the freedom of the press. Affirming, the court ruled that the freedom of press guaranteed by the First Amendment of the federal constitution, and made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, had no application to the distribution of handbills on the streets for purely commercial advertising. The court ruled that the ordinance in question came within the class of a proper legislative purpose and the court was required to uphold the ordinance unless it was adjudged arbitrary or discriminatory, or unduly burdensome or unreasonable. The court found that the ordinance as applied to defendant was not in any way unreasonable. The court found that defendant sought to affix his handbills without permission or knowledge of the owners of the parked automobiles on the street, his conduct exceeded considerate action. The court held that the conduct of private business on the public streets was not a private right and the city authorities could prevent the distribution of handbills thereon for purely commercial advertising.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Justice's Court of Monrovia Township (California) convicted defendant of permitting water to flow onto a highway from his lands in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 588. Defendant appealed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charge against defendant stated that he did wilfully, unlawfully, and maliciously draw, divert, or in any manner permit by seepage, overflow, or otherwise, any water onto a public highway. The charge was brought under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 588, which prohibited a landowner from draining or diverting water from adjacent lands onto a highway. The court reversed defendant's conviction. The complaint was faulty in making its charges in the disjunctive and did not charge that the water which defendant allegedly permitted to flow onto the highway came from lands lying adjacent to the highway. Section 588 was not valid because the legislature declared unlawful many harmless practices in its attempt to outlaw a few harmful practices. The statute was also invalid because it unreasonably restricted the use of defendant's property. The legislature could not impose unreasonable restrictions on the use of private property under the guise of police power.</SPAN></P>
