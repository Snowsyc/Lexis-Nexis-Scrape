The court held the case met the standards of a permissible declaratory action in which the trial court had jurisdiction where speedy relief was necessary to preserve appellants' rights because the challenged regulations specifically prohibited the sale of house trailers not certified and set forth specific requirements for trailer spaces.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was working in a store in which pornographic movies were shown in booths, she was convicted of pandering obscenity, and the court reversed her conviction. The court found that because nowhere in the complaint was defendant charged with having knowledge of the character of the movie, the complaint failed to charge an essential element of the crime and the complaint was therefore insufficient as a matter of law. The court held that this was reversible error. The court determined that from the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have inferred that defendant had knowledge of the character of the movie. The court concluded that the lower court erred in not instructing the jury that knowledge of the film was an element of the offense with which defendant was charged. The court found that the statute under which defendant was convicted was neither unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court concluded that although the legislature violated the equal protection clause by creating a defense to the offense of obscene pandering for projectionists, the statute under which defendant was convicted was still enforceable without the defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendants answered with denials, counterclaims, and cross-claims. The trial court granted judgment against defendants. Defendants voluntarily dismissed their counterclaims and cross-claims, and appealed the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held: (1) defendants failed to demonstrate that they were prejudiced by the change in the judge assigned to the case, so no reversible error resulted from the change; (2) the fact that defendants allegedly ceased the activities complained of and expended costs for defending the injunction action was not sufficient to deny relief to the bar association; (3) defendants did not demonstrate that the trial court erred in refusing to deny the taking of additional evidence because they did not proffer any additional evidence, and (4) the trial court's conclusion was supported by the weight of the evidence because the evidence showed that defendants engaged in the practice of law in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1701.03, and made referrals for illegal fee-splitting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed its first complaint against defendant and defendant entered a plea of not guilty. Seven months later the State filed a second complaint that in essence charged the same offense as the first complaint. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1509.01(D) and 1509.12 were ambiguous, vague, and uncertain and were therefore unconstitutional. The court noted that the initial issue was whether the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.12 constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority that contained inadequate standards. The court held that the authority given in the statute to the chief of the division of oil and gas was not discretionary and the authority exercised against defendant was solely that prescribed by the statute. The court then decided that the issue was whether the statute in form was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the statute did not constitution legislation objectionable under the constitution or otherwise for ambiguity, vagueness, or uncertainty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order by the trial court, Franklin County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of aggravated murder and kidnapping pertaining to the alleged kidnapping and murder of the victim. The trial court imposed the sentence of death on defendant. Two co-defendants were also tried separately upon the same charges, found guilty, and given death sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an initial kidnapping, the victim was murdered in an abandoned schoolhouse by shots from a handgun. The court stated that Ohio law permitted a finding of aggravating circumstances giving rise to consideration of the death penalty only in the instance of one or more of seven specified types of aggravating circumstances in conjunction with a murder. Two of those circumstances were presented to the jury in defendant's case and found to exist as a fact beyond a reasonable doubt. Those were murder for hire and murder while committing the crime of kidnapping. The death penalty was not in itself constitutionally invalid. The statutory scheme for enforcement of the death penalty met constitutional muster and was not in itself improper. The trial court conducted a fair mitigation hearing, and there was no substantial evidence of mitigating circumstances. An impressive chain of direct and circumstantial evidence was produced, linking defendant to the scene of the abduction of the victim and the scene of the murder. There was overwhelming evidence, both direct and circumstantial, of defendant's participation in the planned kidnapping and murder for hire of the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The well drillers sought a declaratory judgment as to the power of the Board to regulate and license well drillers operating in the county, or, in the alternative, to grant a permanent injunction ordering the Board to issue permits for well drillers using &quot;substandard pipe,&quot; that was, pipe having a wall thickness less than required by the Sanitary Code. The court found no express or implied authority in a board of health of a general health district to enact rules and regulations providing for the regulating of well drilling. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated the drilling of water wells and the operation, maintenance and abandonment of wells. The EPA regulations specified the size of water well casing that well drillers could use. The court concluded that the legislature of Ohio had assigned the responsibility of regulating the drilling of water wells to the EPA. The judgment of the trial court was not against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge received his normal compensation for almost three years after he was elected. The city then passed an ordinance that authorized the payment to the judge of certain purported withheld compensation. Am. H.B. 920, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 1968), 1968 Ohio Laws 135 prohibited the claim against the judge. The statute provided that there was no claim upon which relief could be granted and the trial court did not have jurisdiction. The court held that a reasonable construction of the statute, including its title, was that the legislature did not intend to prohibit a prosecutor from bringing an action to reclaim illegally withdrawn public funds pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 117.10. The statute was not unconstitutional and the legislature had the authority to determine when recovery could be had.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officers conducted a warrantless search of defendant during a police raid of a premises that had been under surveillance for a number of weeks.

As soon as the officers were admitted to the premises, they placed defendant under arrest. A search of defendant revealed a fully loaded revolver. The court found that because there was nothing in the record to support the conclusion that the arresting officer saw the actual commission of the alleged misdemeanors, the warrantless search of defendant was invalid. Because the subsequent search was incident to an unlawful arrest, it too was invalid. Thus, the court concluded that the evidence was properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Defendant was charged and found guilty of refuse to a landfill located in a neighboring county. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in determining, as a matter of law, that the rules and regulations of the board were a proper exercise of the board's police powers. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that it was beyond the authority of the board to require by regulation that the landfill in the county be used for all garbage and refuse originating within the county. The legislature did not intend to allow a garbage and refuse monopoly to exist. The board's regulations improperly established a monopoly by mandating the use of the landfill by all garbage and refuse producers within the county at a rate fixed unilaterally by the county commissioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted Akron, Ohio, Ordinance No. 99-1972, which rezoned the landowner's property from industrial to single-family residential. The landowner claimed that the change in zoning was arbitrary, confiscatory and bore no substantial relationship to the preservation of public health, safety, morals or welfare. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12, the Ohio State Attorney General was entitled to be heard on the constitutionality of the ordinance. However, the record did not show that the Attorney General was served with a copy of the proceedings, or had any notice thereof. Section 2721.12 clearly stated that if an ordinance or franchise was alleged to be unconstitutional, the Attorney General shall also be served with a copy of the proceedings and shall be heard. Since there had been a complete failure to do this as far as the record showed, the lower court did not have jurisdiction to proceed to a declaration of rights. Moreover, the complaint should have been received by the Attorney General in time for him to determine whether the State's interests should be represented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother sought review of the decision of the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court (Ohio), which found the child to be a neglected child pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department alleged that the child was seen at the hospital on two occasions, a few days apart, with bruises on his face and buttocks which appeared to have been inflicted by severe slaps. The mother argued, on appeal, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03(C) was unconstitutionally vague, that the statutory scheme of &sect; 2151.03 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the finding of the juvenile court that the child was a neglected child was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) the statute was sufficiently explicit to advise a parent or another that the imposition of severe bruises on an infant could result in a finding that the child was neglected; (2) proof beyond a reasonable doubt was not required in a neglect proceeding in the juvenile court, and that Ohio R. Juv. P. 29(E)(4) fully complied with the requirements of due process; and (3) the evidence supported the conclusion that the child's mother either inflicted the abuse on the child herself, or neglected to prevent such abuse from occurring at the hand of a third person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner desired to construct a new car dealership, a use that was not permitted under the existing zoning classification for the property.

The Board denied the landowner's request. On appeal of the trial court's affirmance of the Board's decision, the court determined that the Board's decision was based on proper sections of the zoning ordinance and that there were no facts indicating that the Board should have granted a &quot;special exception.&quot; The court further ruled that the Board's decision was based on reliable and probative evidence and was not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or illegal within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04. The court further ruled that the fact that specific uses were not enumerated in &sect; 16.07 or elsewhere in the zoning ordinance did not render &sect; 16.07 unconstitutional as an improper delegation of legislative power as determined by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother had acquiesced in a finding of the alleged father's non-paternity. Reversing, the court held that the father of a minor child had a duty to support that child out of his property or by his labor that he owed to the child and the state alike. He had no more right to allow that child to become a charge upon the state than he had to permit the child to suffer neglect. To absolve the alleged father from the natural duty he had as father biologically of the daughter to contribute to the costs of her care and maintenance contravened public policy. The duty of support owed to the child and the state was so basic that it could not be evaded. The mother's motive in acquiescence to the finding of non-paternity was not res judicata as to the daughter on the facts before the court, nor could it operate collaterally to estop the daughter from reopening the issue of the alleged father's liability for support in a separate action. A married woman could make a claim that she had a child by a man other than her husband and sue the man for necessaries furnished the child, for future support, or both. That rule permitted an unmarried woman to maintain a suit against an alleged father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment, which granted the alleged father's summary judgment motion, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A victim was shot during a fight. Defendant claimed that a failure to bring him to trial within time limits set out in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C) and (D) denied his right to a speedy trial and to equal protection of the laws under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Affirming, the court said that any constitutional right to a speedy disposition of a certification proceeding, if any existed, was not violated nor was any statutory right violated by any delay when the Juvenile Court relinquished jurisdiction over the case. Defendant was not twice put in jeopardy by the proceedings in juvenile court. A hearing was held under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26 to establish probable cause. Probable cause was established. The hearing was similar to a preliminary hearing in an adult criminal trial. There was no error in the admission of a taped statement. The State's evidence of defendant's guilt and its consistency with his statement to a police officer on the tape was so overwhelming that a conviction was inevitable. Defendant's testimony at trial rendered any claimed irregularity or error in the taped statement and its admission into evidence harmless and non-prejudicial to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.07; the denial of his motion to read the requirements for criminal liability during final arguments; the sufficiency of the evidence; and the increased jail sentence based on his inability to pay a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant fell asleep while driving, causing the vehicle to leave the roadway and strike a metal signpost, resulting in the death of the passenger. Defendant contended that &sect; 2903.07(A), which defined the offense of vehicular homicide, violated due process because it was vague and indefinite. Defendant argued that, although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.22(D) defined negligently, the addition of the word &quot;substantial&quot; to the phrase &quot;lapse from due care&quot; indicated that something more than ordinary due care was required and rendered the phrase speculative as to the degree of care required. The court disagreed, finding that the statutory definitions set forth a standard of conduct which could be readily applied by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence. The trial court did not err in refusing to permit defense counsel to instruct the jury as to the law to be applied in the case. The evidence permitted the jury to find that defendant continued to drive when he should have known that there was a risk that he could fall asleep at the wheel, causing serious consequences. The trial court clearly erred in increasing defendant's sentence based on defendant's inability to pay the fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment of the municipal court so as to impose a sentence of imprisonment of 120 days and a fine of $ 500, as originally announced by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and a co-conspirator kidnapped and murdered a woman, allegedly for hire. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding first that testimony regarding statements made by the alleged co-conspirator was properly admitted. Testimony of statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy were admissible because the State had already established a conspiracy. Even if it was error, it was not prejudicial because the crucial testimony of defendant's uncle, that defendant had admitted the crime to him, which the jury apparently believed, was overwhelming as to defendant's guilt. Further, it was not error to allow the jury to consider testimony of defendant upon cross-examination regarding a certain conversation. Defendant himself chose to take the witness stand and testify, and he was subject to the same rules concerning impeachment of his credibility upon cross-examination as any other witness. Defendant claimed to have known all along who was responsible but to have waited for the appropriate time to speak up. He then implicated his mother. The State legitimately could probe the issue of why he delayed until his testimony at trial to reveal such information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a patrolman in the Richmond Heights Police Department. At times there were numerous disputes between different factions within the police department and between the mayor and various members of the police force. The patrolman was called to testify in hearings before the Commission upon the appeal of the police chief from suspension and other disciplinary sanctions imposed by the mayor. The patrolman falsely stated that he did not participate in an investigation of a car accident in which a sergeant was involved. Defendant was then convicted of knowingly making a false statement, and the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that his false statement was not punishable because it was not material to the outcome of the proceeding. Because the State of Ohio had the right to expect that witnesses in all official proceedings would not deliberately make false statements, when any falsehoods were knowingly presented as evidence in such a proceeding, the State was justified in applying criminal sanctions. Indeed, insuring the truth of the testimony of witnesses was necessary in order to guarantee the integrity of public proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nursing home requested the vacation of a portion of a street. The business owner protested the vacation. An ordinance vacating the street was passed. The business owner circulated referendum petitions, which were filed with the board. The nursing home sought to enjoin a referendum vote on the ordinance, and the trial court granted the injunction. The business owner appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in holding that the passing of the ordinance was an administrative act and therefore not subject to referendum. The court noted that the determination by a municipal legislative authority as to whether or not to continue to maintain a public street had within it many administrative determinations and held that such determinations should not have been tested or determined by way of referendum, but by way of an appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506. The court also found that those determinations required informed judgments by people who had knowledge of the current needs and budgetary considerations of the municipality as a whole.

The driver sustained injuries, and the car was damaged, and plaintiffs filed an action against the owner. The trial court granted the owner's motion for a directed verdict, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the driver was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law because the evidence established that the driver was guilty of violating the assured-clear-distance law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.21. Also, as a matter of law, the owner was not guilty of willful and wanton misconduct. The owner was obviously negligent in abandoning his non-operational car while attempting to find help, but his behavior did not show a disposition to perversity. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in directing a verdict. The constitutionality of the doctrine of contributory negligence was not raised in the first instance in the trial court and was being raised for the first time on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant accompanied several other individuals to the residence of the victim. The victim was shot and killed by one of the other individuals. Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery and sentenced to death by the trial court.

The court determined that the evidence indicated that defendant was aware of the intent to rob the victim, that he actively participated in the events, that he was the driver of the car which followed the victim home, that he was with the individual who shot the victim when the murder occurred, and that there was forensic evidence tying him to the crimes. As to the prosecutor's alleged misconduct, the court held that the prosecutor's questioning of the one of the witnesses, even if improper, was not prejudicial in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. The court held that defendant's arguments regarding his sentence of death were premature based on the fact that similar issues were then pending before the United States Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city challenged the decision of the Barberton Municipal Court of Summit County (Ohio), which dismissed an action by the city against defendant company for violating a city ordinance concerning the company's actions during a labor strike under Barberton, Ohio, Ordinance No. 19-1964 on the grounds that No. 19-1964 was unconstitutional and that No. 19-1964 was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company was cited for violating No. 19-1964. The trial court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the subject matter. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The city's argument was untenable because a municipality was preempted from legislating any matter that was subject to the Act. The subject matter of No. 19-1964 concerned a sensitive area of labor-management relations regarding the company's conduct during a strike. The court opined that there was little doubt that this was precisely the area of concern that the U.S. Congress intended to preempt. Although the city correctly contended that there were exceptions to the preemption rule, none of the exceptions were applicable. Number 19-1964, although couched in terms of local police powers, affected the balance of negotiating power sought to be maintained by the federal statutes. The contention that through No. 19-1964 the city sought to prevent violence during a strike was not sufficient to except it from the federal preemption doctrine, and the trial court properly dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been convicted following a bench trial for assault and battery, a violation of Sheffield, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 533.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with assault and battery in violation of Sheffield, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 533.01. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the ordinance was in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.13 and, therefore, unconstitutional. The trial court overruled defendant's motion. A bench trial was held in which defendant was found guilty and sentence was imposed. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to dismiss for the trial court's failure to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2938.11(F). The denial of that motion prompted defendant to appeal. Defendant argued the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the case after it failed to reach a decision for a period of six to eight months after submission of the evidence. The court found that while &sect; 2938.11(F) was directory only in stating that any finding following a bench trial must be delivered in open court within 48 hours, the seven month delay violated defendant's right to due process and his right to a speedy trial. Such a violation required reversal of defendant's conviction and his immediate discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband, who had filed a previous damage suit against the putative father of his wife's child for alienation of affections, claimed that the trial court erred by denying his motion to be appointed as the guardian ad litem for the child and by dismissing the wife's complaint against the father for support and expenses for the child. The husband also claimed the trial court erred by dismissing his motion for intervention. The court determined that the parties agreed that wife and father were the parents of the child, which was then illegitimate, and that the husband was entitled to represent the interests of the child as a guardian ad litem, pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 17(B). The court held that the child was entitled to the same protections as a legitimate child, who could be represented by an ad litem to bring claims for support and expenses related to the child's birth pursuant to Rule 17(B).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While on routine patrol, an officer saw defendant stumbling along a sidewalk. When seen again shortly thereafter, approximately five feet away, apparently intoxicated, the officer arrested him. The name defendant gave to the officer when asked for purposes of the arrest information sheet differed from the name on defendant's identification cards. When confronted with the two names, defendant conceded he used both names. Defendant owed a fine to the city under the name on the identification card. On appeal, defendant first argued that his conviction for falsification was a violation of due process because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.13(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague. The court found no constitutional infirmity in the statute, which prohibited making a false statement with the intent of misleading a public official in performing his official function. However, the court found that a person could adopt any name if not done for fraudulent purposes. The record did not show the name given was actually false, with a purpose to mislead, and there was no substantial impairment of an official function as defendant's arrest related to his person, not his name.</SPAN></P>

The mobile vendor, a for-profit vendor, sold his wares in the area without a permit and in violation of Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code 713-3. The mobile vendor argued that the classification between for-profit vendors and non-profit vendors violated equal protection. The trial court agreed. On appeal, the court determined that Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code 713-3 was not unconstitutional and did not violate equal protection. The court concluded the City had the power to make all reasonable, necessary, and appropriate provisions to promote the health, morals, peace, and welfare of the community and that the City had to power to enact Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun.

The ordinance required a minimum number of square feet for each one-bedroom apartment unit in a district with R-3 zoning. The option-holder sought to build apartments with a smaller square footage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The option-holder sought a zoning variance to allow development of 32 one-bedroom apartment units of 576 square feet each. The applicable ordinance required a minimum of 750 square feet for each one bedroom unit. The trial court affirmed the Board's denied of the variance. In support of his appeal, the option-holder argued that the ordinance was so unreasonable as to constitute a denial of due process under U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; I and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16; that its enforcement constituted a taking without just compensation contrary to Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19; and that the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The most the court could say for the option-holder's evidence was that it showed that the reasonableness of the zoning ordinance was fairly debatable. The option-holder's witnesses considered certain factors involved in determining the wisdom of zoning regulations, but not others. There was no basis in the record for the court to find that a minimum 750 square foot requirement for a one-bedroom apartment unit in an R-3 district was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious, or that the ordinance violated any of the cited constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that the trial court erred when it refused to discharge him because the State failed to bring him to trial within the time required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71. The court determined that the plea of guilt was void because it was not knowingly and intelligently made since the trial court incorrectly informed defendant that he was waiving his right to appeal the speedy trial issue by pleading guilty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner planned to develop its property. The county commissioners approved the plans for the project and contracted for the installation of the water and sewer lines.

The landowner claimed that it owed a lesser amount, pursuant to its agreements with the engineer's office, and refused to pay the assessment. The landowner sought an injunction against the auditor from collecting the excess amount. The trial court adopted the referee's opinion that there was no binding agreement between the landowner and the engineer's office. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the engineer's office had no authority to enter into a contract because there was no evidence indicating that the commissioners expressly delegated the authority. The court held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel was not available to enforce the agreements because the owner was charged with the knowledge that the engineer's office had no authority to contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two agents from an insurance company visited defendants' towing and ambulance service company to investigate a claim for a stolen ambulance. They were escorted into the owner's private office, which was small, 7 x 13 feet, and contained a sofa, a desk, and a file cabinet, leaving very little room in which to move around. During the conversation the relative of the owner was called into the office. He stood near the closed door of the office while the agents sat on the sofa. When one agent requested records, the owner became hostile, removed a pistol from his safe, and tossed it to his relative by the door. The owner took a gun out of his desk drawer and placed it in his pocket. He then took two rifles from under the couch and displayed them. One of the agents apologized, and the owner put away the rifles and guns. The agents left. Defendants were convicted of aggravated menacing. On appeal, the court found that a reasonable man would consider the exhibiting of guns and rifles in a locked room while heated remarks were being made to be menacing activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant licensed boiler operators challenged the judgment of the trial court (Ohio) in favor of appellees, the Department of Industrial Relations and others, in the boiler operators' action to prohibit appellees from retesting the boiler operators as a condition of renewal of their licenses as boiler operators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The boiler operators were notified that an examination was required as a condition of license renewal for those persons issued licenses between February 6, 1973 and January 17, 1975 because during that period, eight persons obtained their licenses by fraud. The court determined that appellees sought to shift their burden of proof of fraud from themselves to a select class of individuals, of whom 99 percent were apparently conceded to be innocent of any misconduct and fully qualified to possess a boiler operator's license. The court explained that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4739.12 did not permit re-examination of boiler operators as a condition of license renewal in order to ascertain whether their original license was procured by fraud or whether they were unfit operators. The court noted that &sect; 4739.12 was not unconstitutional because it did not permit appellees to cast the burden of proof upon the holders of boiler operator licenses, valid on their face, to prove absence from fraud as a condition of license renewal regardless of when the license was obtained. The court concluded that alternative methods could have been used to ferret out those persons who were suspected of fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sustained the boiler operators' assignment of error three and overruled assignments of error one, two, and four. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered the entry of the judgment that the trial court should have ordered, enjoining appellees from requiring a re-examination of the boiler operators as a condition to renewal of their licenses. The court remanded the case to the trial court for execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed their complaint pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss the claim. The court held that while a prior decision holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6111.13 authorized a constitutional exercise of the police power of the State of Ohio, the decision was not immutable. The court held that in appellants' case, the facts alleged, if proved, could materially alter the question of whether the statute was constitutional as a valid exercise of police power bearing a real and substantial relationship to public health, safety, and welfare.

The court held that on the face of the pleadings and evidence before the court, on the motion for summary judgment, there was no jurisdiction of the lower court over the subject matter of the complaint, and there was nothing by way of discovery which would have enabled plaintiffs to remain in court. The court found that no useful purpose would have been served by compelling the employer to answer the interrogatories propounded by plaintiffs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee organization brought an action against appellees seeking a declaratory judgment that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.271, which permitted provisional civil service employees in certain circumstances to become permanent employees without taking a civil service examination, was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the statute was valid. The organization sought review and the court reversed. The court noted that there were two classes of government employees--the classified service and the unclassified service. The competitive class of the classified service, the court said, consisted only of positions for which it was practicable to determine the merit and fitness of applicants by competitive examination. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.11(B)(1). Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 10 specifically mandated that the merit and fitness of applicants for such positions be determined by an examination, the court said. The court concluded that it was apparent that an examination was constitutionally required of all applicants for permanent positions in the competitive class of the classified service. Thus, &sect; 124.271 directly contravened the constitutional requirement and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that when an appeal was taken from an administrative decision pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Further, the court held that when a variance was denied, the test to be applied was whether the ordinance, in proscribing a landowner's proposed use of his land, bore a reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, welfare, or morals.

The court held that where there was credible evidence in the record to support the findings of fact made by the trier of fact, the judgment of the trial court should be sustained. The court also found that the trial court did not err in imposing a sentence of life imprisonment because the crime was a capital offense that would have merited a death penalty but for an intervening United States Supreme Court opinion invalidating the death penalty set forth in a statute similar to that of Ohio. The court held that, despite the inability to sentence defendant to a death penalty, the crime remained a capital offense for which punishment by life imprisonment was warranted.

Within 15 minutes, a patrolman and a police cadet arrived on the scene. The police cadet testified he could smell an odor of alcohol, upon opening the door to the individual's car, and the individual's voice was slurred and his speech mumbled. Being of the opinion that the individual was under the influence of alcohol, the patrolman placed him under arrest for driving while under the influence and for backing his vehicle improperly down the expressway. The individual was taken to police headquarters, where he refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. He informed the police that he did not want to take the test. At the trial, the police cadet identified the individual's exhibit, which was the notification of refusal to submit to the test. The individual's privilege of operating a motor vehicle was then suspended for six months. His complaint against the registrar was later dismissed. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the exhibit without testimony from the patrolman because the police cadet identified the exhibits, and defendant failed to subpoena the patrolman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff driver brought an action in the Municipal Court of Bryan (Ohio) to challenge the suspension of his driver's license by defendant Registrar of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(D). The trial court held that the Registrar did not err in revoking the driver's license. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was arrested by a uniformed police officer in a marked car as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4549.13 and 4549.15 after a police officer in an unmarked car observed the driver's erratic driving and called for backup. The driver refused to talk and refused to submit to the breathalyzer test. The police officer read the driver the implied consent form stating that the driver's license would be revoked pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(D) if the driver refused to take a breathalyzer test. The court rejected the driver's allegations that the Registrar inadequately advised the driver of the consequences of not taking a breathalyzer test and erred in permitting a blood alcohol test. The driver was properly advised of the consequences of refusing to take the breathalyzer test. The subsequent blood alcohol test was an accommodation of the driver's request. The driver alleged that the implied consent statute was unconstitutional. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(D) was constitutional. The driver was accorded a hearing before the termination of his license became effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners were denied a building permit to construct a building and denied rezoning of their land from residential use to local business use. The trial court found that the zoning, which restricted the use of the landowners' property to residential use, constituted a taking of property without due process of law. The trial court ordered issuance of a building permit to the landowners. Over three years later, the landowners applied for a building permit to construct a pole sign. The permit was denied because a new ordinance prohibited the use of pole signs. Under the zoning laws in effect when the landowners made their original application for a building permit, pole signs could be constructed on land zoned for local business use. The issue on appeal was whether the trial court's judgment included an order to issue the landowners a permit to construct a pole sign. The court stated that issuance of a building permit was governed by the zoning ordinances in effect at the time of the application. Thus, the landowners were not entitled to a building permit to construct a pole sign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Department of Mental Health commenced an action against appellant parents for the cost of supporting their adult son in a state mental hospital, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5121. The parents challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 5121. The trial court, Franklin County (Ohio) rendered judgment in favor of the Department and the parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that a statute, which made a parent of an adult child or the parent's estate liable for the support of such child while he was an inmate of a state hospital for the mentally ill or a state institution for the feeble minded, was not violative of the constitutional rights of such parent or estate. Therefore, the court ruled that the parents were obligated to pay for their son's hospital costs. The parents contended that they had good faith evidence showing that their financial condition was such as to entitle them to a reduction in the charge made by the state. The court found that there was no pretrial order to indicate that the parties' stipulation of facts was intended to be a complete stipulation and that no other evidence was to be adduced. It appeared that the parties honestly disagreed as to the effect of the stipulation. The court stated that in the interests of justice, all doubts had to be resolved in the parents' favor and they had to be permitted to produce evidence indicating that they were entitled to a reduction of charges. If the parents were entitled to a reduction, the evidence had to be heard and the reduction applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court regarding the parents' obligation to pay for their son's hospital costs and reversed the trial court's judgment regarding the finality of the stipulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants ordered the property owner to discontinue the operation of a gas station on its property for the reason that the property owner had forfeited its non-conforming gas station use in an area zoned for multiple family uses. The trial court determined that the property owner had not abandoned the non-conforming use. Appellants argued that the trial court erred in finding that their decision was unconstitutional and that the evidence showed an intention to abandon the premises. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15, not Lakewood, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1127.01(d), controlled the case because the zoning provisions in question involved a state-wide interest. Although appellants showed that the property owner had not used its property as a service station for more than one year, appellants failed to show that the property owner had voluntarily discontinued the use of the property as a service station for two years, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15. With regard to the trial court's not finding an intention to abandon, the court held that it must presume that the trial court acted in a proper manner in the absence of a complete record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions arose from the robbery and killing of the proprietor of a flower shop. Defendant was found guilty of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant's counsel to examine the prospective jurors at voir dire upon the question of capital punishment, by allowing testimony as to defendant's past criminal record into evidence, and in allowing inflammatory photographic slides of the victim. In affirming defendant's convictions, the court held that defendant was not entitled to question the juror's regarding their opinion of the death penalty because a juror's admission that he was not opposed to the death penalty did not raise a challenge for cause in the defense. As to the reference to defendant prior convictions, defendant failed to object at trial. Nevertheless, the making of the statements in the presence of the jury was harmless error. Finally, the challenged autopsy photographs were relevant and useful to the jury in understanding the coroner's testimony and were admissible.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss the builders' claim to recover assessments and fees for building permits for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to Ohio R.

The court held that the builder's complaint adequately stated a declaratory judgment action, and the trial court erred in dismissing the builder's complaint under Rule 12 (B)(6).

Defendant's sentence was reduced to 6 months to 5 years. Defendant appealed from the original sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the 20-to-40 year penalty applicable to his drug-related offense on the grounds that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In so arguing, defendant relied on an opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's original sentence, reasoning that the court was not bound by decisions of the Sixth Circuit. Even so, the decision upon which defendant relied had been vacated by the Supreme Court of the United States and the case had been remanded to the Sixth Circuit for reconsideration in light of Am. Sub. H.B. 300, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), which provided for substantial reductions of penalties for drug convictions. Even with the much more severe penalties applicable at the time of defendant's original sentencing, the sentence was not unconstitutional. Regardless, the issue was rendered moot by the modification of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The electric company required an easement across the landowner's property for a transmission line and after the parties failed to reach an agreement on the matter, the electric company brought an action to require the landowner to allow the easement. The probate court determined that the electric company was entitled to the easement and the jury made a determination of the amount the landowner was entitled to receive. The landowner sought review, arguing that his award under the Ohio Uniform Eminent Domain Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4933.15, violated his equal protection rights because the amount was less than that provided to individuals under the Relocation Assistance Act. The court held that there was a rational basis for treating individuals under the Relocation Assistance Act differently because the individuals were completely displaced, whereas the landowner had only forfeited a portion of his property. Since the Ohio Uniform Eminent Domain Act was constitutional and the decisions made by the probate court were reasonable, the court found that it could not disturb the probate court's findings on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties entered into a contract that contained an arbitration clause.

The court held that the dismissal was proper because no stay was requested under R.C. 2711.02. Because no stay was requested, the dismiss should have been with prejudice. The arbitration clause was not unenforceable as against public policy because the owners relied on cases decided prior to the enactment of the various arbitration statutes. Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2711.01-2711.15 did not oust the jurisdiction of the courts, they merely provide for an additional remedy. The owner failed to request a motion hearing pursuant to C. P. Cuyahoga County R. 11(A) so they could not claim the absence of a hearing as an error on appeal. Ohio Rev.

The court held that the provisions of &sect;&sect; 2945.71 and 2945.73 were mandatory and had to be strictly complied with by the State. The court held that the record failed to indicate that the State was unable to bring the appellant to trial on or before December 2, 1974, because of a period of delay necessitated by defendant's lack of assigned or substituted counsel. The court held, however, that defendant's pre-trial motion necessitated a delay such that &sect; 2945.72(E) operated to extend the time for trial. The court also held that &sect; 2907.05 was not so vague on its face that men of common intelligence necessarily had to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was alleged that defendant had knowingly and unlawfully failed to maintain and support an illegitimate child. Defendant appeared in the juvenile court and waived his rights to counsel and a jury trial. The juvenile court asked defendant whether or not he was guilty of the offense charged, and defendant stated he was guilty. The court reversed. It was evident that the guilty plea was constitutionally defective. Nowhere in the record was there any indication of what statutory offense defendant was charged, that defendant ever received a copy of the affidavit upon which the charges were made, or that any charges were read or otherwise made known to him. Defendant was advised of and waived only his right to counsel and his right to a jury trial. There was no evidence to support a knowing waiver of the right to confront witnesses against him, of the privilege against self-incrimination, or that defendant understood the consequences of his guilty plea. The court had no choice but to hold that the judgment of conviction based upon defendant's guilty plea was unconstitutional, and that the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff argued on appeal that the trial court erred in finding that her notice of appeal filed with the Board was not &quot;timely&quot; under Ohio Rev.

P. 6(E) allowed an additional three-day period in calculating the appeal time. The court rejected the argument and held that Ohio R. Civ. P. 6(E), by its very language, was inapplicable. The court noted that Ohio R. Civ. P. 1(C) provided that the civil rules were not applicable to procedures upon appeal to review any judgment order or ruling. Plaintiff also argued that the trial court's interpretation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12, finding that the 15 day period for filing the notice of appeal began to run upon the mailing of the decision rather than the receipt of the decision, was unconstitutional. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the right of appeal was not an inherent right but was conferred by statute. The legislature could condition the exercise of the right as it saw fit. Plaintiff's failure to comply with the mandatory time limit rendered the trial court without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the death penalty was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress his inculpatory statement.

The court held that the death penalty was not per se unconstitutional and that, under the State's statutory scheme, the penalty was not imposed in a discriminatory manner. The court also found that, although maturity was a factor to be considered, defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights where he was reasonably intelligent and the police contacted defendant's mother prior to taking the statement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil company's property was zoned for single-family use, and the oil company applied for rezoning, which was denied. The trial court determined that the oil company was entitled to construct a service station on the parcels. The city and the commissioner alleged that the oil company failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by seeking a variance from the board of zoning appeals. However, the court noted that the oil company did not have to exhaust its administrative remedies if the zoning appeals board did not have the authority to grant the relief sought and could, therefore, seek declaratory relief. The court held that the zoning appeals board was not permitted to grant a non-conforming use variance under of the Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Charter &sect; 8(d). The court determined that the only relief that could be obtained by the oil company was for rezoning or for declaratory relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order from the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio) that convicted him of presenting or participating in presenting an obscene performance in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A magistrate issued a search warrant for an allegedly obscene film presented by defendant. In a trial without a jury, defendant was found guilty, and his term of imprisonment was suspended. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the indictment was fatally defective in that it failed to allege that defendant had either knowledge of the character of the material or actual notice of the nature of that material. Thus, the indictment failed to charge defendant with conduct for which criminal penalties could attach, and at trial, the State failed to offer any evidence of defendant's guilty knowledge or purpose. The court also found that probable cause did not exist for the issuance of the warrant and that defendant's motion to suppress should have been granted. Although the magistrate was not required to view the film prior to issuing the warrant, there was no indication in the affidavit as to the content of the film taken as a whole or whether it lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Further, because of the fact that the affidavit was based upon hearsay, the magistrate had no opportunity to make further inquiry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a former patient of a county facility, challenged two judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed the patient's actions against defendants, a hospital, an employee of the hospital, and the Franklin County, Ohio, Commissioners. The patient claimed that she was injured while a patient at the hospital. The trial court found that defendants were all immune from liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By her complaint the patient brought her action against the hospital and the Commissioners in their official capacity. In addition, the patient joined the employee, whom she alleged was an orderly employed at the hospital that negligently injured her. Affirming the judgment in favor of the Commissioners and the hospital, the court held that there was no authorization for the patient to maintain an action against the County or its agencies under the alleged circumstances. The County and its agencies were completely immune from suit for negligence in the absence of statutory authorization for such a suit. The court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2743.02(A) and 2743.01 constitutional and that these statutes did not constitute a denial of the equal protection of the law to anyone because the State waived immunity as to the State itself, but not political subdivisions. The extent to which the State wished to waive sovereign immunity was a matter for the State to determine. The court noted that the employee was not entitled to the protection of the sovereign immunity of the county. There was no basis before the court to afford any immunity to the employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with indecent exposure in violation of a metropolitan park district rule prohibiting lewd and lascivious behavior. There was evidence that defendant grabbed another's penis. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the park had authority to make the rule. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1545.09, the park commissioners had the power to adopt rules and regulations for the preservation of good order within and adjacent to the park. Preventing lewd, lascivious, obscene, or indecent acts or conduct achieved that purpose. The rule was rationally related to the health, safety, welfare, and morals of those who used the park. Next, the court held that the rule was not void for vagueness. Because an act was involved, it was not a First Amendment issue. Defendant's conduct fell within the common understanding of what the rule proscribed and thus instructed defendant in the standard to which his conduct should have conformed. Finally, the court held that evidence of entrapment was so slight that the trial court was justified in concluding that the defense was not made and in denying a motion for dismissal based on entrapment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was fatally shot in the parking lot of the supermarket he managed.

At trial, one of the police officers testified that another police officer told defendant that his two accomplices had been arrested and that both of them had identified defendant as the triggerman. Defendant did not testify at trial. Following a mitigation hearing, the trial court found no mitigating circumstances and sentenced defendant to death. The court held that, although the trial court erred in admitting the police officer's testimony regarding the statement of another police officer, where such statement constituted double hearsay, the admission of such statement was harmless error in light of the direct testimony regarding defendant's participation in the murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Ohio) which, following a jury trial, convicted defendant of possession of a hallucinogen in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.41. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to discharge for lack of speedy trial and in charging the jury on reasonable doubt and possession. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of a videotaped trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was previously convicted of the same charge, but that conviction was reversed and the case remanded. In the interim, the trial court had adopted a rule providing for videotaped trials. Defendant objected to the videotaped trial but his objection was overruled. The second trial took place approximately a year after the case was remanded and resulted in conviction. Shortly before trial, defendant filed a motion for discharge based upon the violation of his statutory and constitutional rights to a speedy trial. The court held that the statutory speedy trial right did not apply to a case remanded for retrial. The court also determined that defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated because, although the delay was unduly long, defendant failed to make an effort to procure a speedier trial. The court, however, found that allowing a videotaped trial violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10, which allowed a deposition to be used only where a witness was unavailable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution appealed from a judgment of the Municipal Court of Hamilton County (Ohio), which sustained the motion of defendant to dismiss a charge against him for violating Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 407-97, which prohibited one from accepting passengers for compensation if he did not operate a public vehicle duly licensed in accordance with the Cincinnati Municipal Code. The trial court found &sect; 407-97 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that without specific restriction to unlicensed vehicles operating for hire upon public streets, &sect; 407-97 was overbroad, including in its provisions the forbidding of a private driver of a private vehicle from accommodating his friends under any informal arrangements, as in a car pool, and extending its provisions to the use of private property as well as public streets. In reversing the finding of unconstitutionality, the court held that it was a fundamental rule that an ordinance would be presumed constitutional until the contrary was made clearly to appear. The court would not place a tortured or unreasonable construction upon the ordinance so that it could be declared unconstitutional. The ordinance's common, ordinary meaning, in light of its true and acknowledged purpose had to be accepted. Thus, the ordinance could not be declared unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens sought to enjoin a city traffic ordinance on constitutional grounds. The trial court refused to enjoin the ordinance, and the citizens appealed. The city filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the citizens failed to serve process on the attorney general pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. The citizens contended that they did not seek declaratory relief so &sect; 2721.12 was not applicable. The court granted the city's motion to dismiss. The serving of the attorney general was a jurisdictional question as to the authority of the trial court, and it was proper to consider the question on appeal. Although the citizens prayed for injunctive relief in their complaint, they alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional. It was clear that the complaint asked the trial court to declare the ordinance unconstitutional and was within &sect; 2721.12, which applied to actions asking for declaratory relief.

Two men, one of whom the manager identified as co-defendant, were seen in the store's meat locker. The store safe showed signs of being tampered with. An officer testified that he saw two men running inside the store towards the back and the officer, after running behind the store, saw one man crouching near a store window with a crowbar nearby. The window had been broken and the iron bars around it had been pried apart. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that: (1) the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for aiding and abetting co-defendant in the charged offenses and the circumstantial evidence was irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of defendant's innocence; (2) by not objecting at trial, defendant waived any error regarding the trial court's jury charge on possession of criminal tools; and (3) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24 was not unconstitutionally vague in its description of criminal tools and the rebuttable presumption created by the statute with respect to possession of such tools was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and subsequently convicted defendant of disorderly conduct in violation of Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 910-3(a)(2). Section 910-3(a)(2), which was identical to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(a), was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 910-3(a)(2) was less vague than Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(a), which was previously held to be constitutional. Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 910-3(a)(2) punished &quot;fighting words&quot; and was not susceptible to application to protested speech. Defendant was not charged with obscene language.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was apprehended in the process of robbing a supermarket.

P. 16(B)(1)(g) for an in camera inspection of a prior statement made by the store's manager. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that it came too late because the defense had already started to cross-examine the manager. The language of Rule 16(B)(1)(g) was construed by the trial court to require that defense counsel had to request the inspection of the witness' prior statement immediately at the close of the direct examination and prior to commencing his cross-examination. The court agreed with defendant that it was error not to conduct an in camera inspection of the manager's written statement upon defense counsel's motion during his cross-examination of the manager. Nonetheless, because the record in the case presented overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, the court held that the trial judge's erroneous ruling on the Rule 16 issue was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for violation of several drug offenses. He was sentenced to 10-year minimum sentence for possession for sale and 20-year minimum for sale. He appealed. The court affirmed in part and remanded in part. The court noted a federal court had found a similar sentence unconstitutional because it was cruel and unusual punishment. However, the court noted that the sentence imposed had been a binding precedent for 20 years. The court noted that the legislature had, after the trial, reduced the minimum sentences. The court remanded the sentence to the trial court to reconsider its sentence in light of the new legislation and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01 et seq. The court found that possession for sale was not a lesser-included offense of sale; therefore, there was no double jeopardy violation. A conviction for sale did not require proof of possession for sale.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, township board of zoning appeals and other interested parties, appealed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio), which held that the board improperly denied a variance to plaintiff landowner, who had requested that the width of setback lines be reduced so that he could divide his property into three lots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The township required wide lots at the setback line in situations where the property was not served by central sewers. The practical effect of the wide lot requirement was that the owner could only divide his property into two lots, instead of the three lots that he sought to create. The landowner requested a variance from a zoning inspector, and the inspector denied the request. When the landowner appealed to the board, it also denied his request for a variance. Upon appeal to the trial court, additional evidence was presented, but there was no evidence of any undue hardship caused by the wide lot requirement. The trial court reversed the board's order, and the court reversed the trial court. The court held that the landowner had the burden of proving that the board's order was incorrect, and in its review of the trial court's decision, it was required to uphold the trial court if there was evidence to support that court's decision that the landowner had satisfied his burden of proof. Because there was no evidence that the denial of the variance caused undue hardship to the landowner, the court ruled that the trial court erred in granting the variance.</SPAN></P>

The State was required to establish that at least one of the items was &quot;of an unsightly or unsanitary nature&quot; as outlined in the statute. In addition, there was no statutory definition of what area constituted the &quot;bank&quot; of the lake so as to enable determination of whether the wood, stone, or other debris of an unsightly or unsanitary nature were disposed of &quot;upon the bank.&quot; Finally, no testimony by the State establishes or even suggested that the named items were liable to be washed into the water by ordinary flow or flood. Testimony established that the items were not liable to be washed into the water by ordinary flow or floods. Even if the named items were covered by the statute, the elements of unsightliness or unsanitariness or of liability to be washed into the lake were not established by any degree of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant church sought review of a decision of a court of common pleas (Ohio), which, in an appeal to that court from a decision of appellee Zoning Board of Appeals, affirmed that decision, which concluded that the church, as a successor in interest to a party in previous litigation, was estopped from asserting that the application of Greenhills Village, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance 881 constituted an unconstitutional taking without compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church appealed the Service Director's denial of its application to place a parking lot and &quot;paved recreational area&quot; on a parcel that it owned adjacent to existing church facilities. It also sought a variance to permit the construction. The Board denied the permit application and refused to grant the variance. After a second hearing on remand from the supreme court, which directed the common pleas court to consider the constitutional question, the common pleas court again affirmed the Board's decision, and the church appealed. The court reversed, holding that there had been a material change of circumstances that allowed the church to assert that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking without compensation. The court noted that when the church purchased the tract, only part of it was subject to the zoning ordinance, which was later changed to delete the possibility of using the part of the tract not covered by the ordinance for church purposes. The actual permissible uses were so limited by the particular characteristics of the parcel that the ordinance, as applied, was void as unreasonable, confiscatory, and violative of the church's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the common pleas court's judgment and reversed the Board's decision. The court directed the Service Director to issue a building and/or zoning permit to the church to construct a parking lot and paved recreational area on the land indicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Township trustees passed a resolution adopting proposals to rezone some property into three different residential zones, but they rejected a proposed business district.

Relators claimed that the Board could not review the sufficiency or validity of the petitions or, if it could, that it erroneously determined that the petitions were misleading. The court held that mandamus was a proper remedy if relators' allegations were substantively correct because relators had no adequate remedy at law. However, the court concluded that the relators did not have a clear right to require the Board to place the referendum on the ballot because: (1) the Board had a duty under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3501.11 to examine the petitions and determine whether they complied with requirements governing referendum petitions, which were all procedural in nature, and (2) the petitions were misleading in that they included the business use proposal as part of the title of the resolution without clearly indicating that the trustees had not approved it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The entire case against defendant resulted from her complicity with three companions in the robbery and murder of a pawn shop owner. Defendant selected the victim's business for the robbery and figured out how to get a gun. Defendant assigned 15 errors, many of which she waived by failing to object at trial. Affirming the judgment, the court found that the trial court guarded defendant's statutory and constitutional rights well and that none of the alleged errors were prejudicial to those rights, thereby denying her a fair trial. The court held that intent to kill could be inferred from the use of a loaded gun during an armed robbery and that defendant was an aider and abettor to both murder and robbery. The court determined that the fact that the triggerman plea-bargained for a life sentence did not make defendant's death sentence illegal where she rejected the same offer and voluntarily assumed the risk of a death penalty. The court held that Ohio's capital punishment statute and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;2929.04(B), which precluded capital punishment if defendant showed by a preponderance of the evidence that at least one mitigating factor was present, were both constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2921.32(A)(5) was ambiguous, invalid, and unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in overruling her motions for discharge and that it erred in finding her guilty, as the finding was contrary to the evidence and the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with obstructing justice when she denied that the subject of an arrest warrant was at her home. At trial, when the State rested, defendant made a motion for her discharge, which was denied. She then introduced evidence on her own behalf and renewed her motion at the close of all evidence. On appeal from her conviction, the court held that defendant had waived her right to rely on the denial of her first motion for acquittal because she had proceeded to introduce evidence. The court determined that defendant could appeal from the denial of her second motion; however, her motion for acquittal could not have been granted because substantial evidence that defendant had committed the crime existed. The court stated that the issue of the constitutionality of a statute ordinarily had to have been raised in the trial court or the issue was waived, but the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.32(A)(5) was not ambiguous, invalid, and unconstitutional. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court concluded that, in light of the record, the trial court's judgment was supported by sufficient credible evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 1501.0704 required the landlord to provide the names and addresses of his tenants to the local tax administrator. The landlord refused to do so, even though he was notified of the requirement in writing. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although the court agreed that an ordinance was entitled to a presumption of validity and that the power to tax included the power to collect and police the tax, the court held that those principles were not controlling. The court instead determined that the ordinance in question improperly required the landlord to do investigative work for the city and noted that the information requested could be gained by other less intrusive means, such as through street and telephone directories. The court also found that &sect; 1501.0704 was not necessary to accomplish a compelling governmental interest as providing tenants' names and addresses had no bearing on the landlord's tax liability.

Defendant was kept in custody for a period of 94 days, and he was tried 282 days after his arrest. At no time during defendant's custody did defendant request a continuance. Prior to the impaneling of a jury, defendant moved the court of common pleas for dismissal of the charges on the grounds that the State failed to bring defendant to trial within the time limit set out in Ohio Rev.

The court noted that &sect;2945.71 required that trial be commenced within 270 days of arrest for all persons charged with having committed a felony. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the charges because defendant was tried 282 days after arrest, which was more than the 270 day limit specified in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C). The court also rejected the State's argument that although defendant was in custody for more than 90 days before trial, and therefore would be entitled to dismissal of the charges against him under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of a common pleas court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault and sentenced defendant accordingly. Defendant had been indicted for felonious assault in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.11. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, but execution on defendant's sentence was suspended during the pendency of defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, the State presented testimony from the victim and his brother, which, if believed by the trier of fact, would have established that defendant was guilty of the offense as charged. The defense presented testimony from defendant, his common law wife, and defendant's stepson, which, if believed by the trier of fact, would have established self-defense as a complete defense to the offense charged. In affirming, the court held that by discounting some testimony and believing other it was possible for the trial judge to have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of aggravated assault and that the defense of self-defense did not apply. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02(F) was constitutional because its purpose was to protect society by denying probation to those individuals who had already produced substantial harm by taking a life or by committing a crime while armed with a weapon. Thus, there was a rational basis for the classification and it was not discriminatory. Section 2951.02(F) was not vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), following a jury trial, in which he was found guilty of aggravated robbery. Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it overruled his motion to dismiss based upon the grounds that he was denied his right to a speedy trial in violation of his constitutional and statutory rights under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for aggravated robbery on October 8, 1974, and indicted on November 7, 1974. On December 9, 1974, during a pretrial session, the State and defense counsel agreed to try the case on January 10, 1975. He was unable to furnish bail and was jailed from the date of his arrest until trial, which began on January 14, 1975. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial under &sect;&sect; 2945.71, 2945.72, 2945.73. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated robbery because the record affirmatively established that his counsel voluntarily agreed to the trial date knowing that that it fell on a day more than 90 days after defendant's arrest. The defense counsel acted voluntarily, knowingly; and entered the trial date agreement on a date within the time restrictions promulgated under &sect; 2945.71. The court recognized the waiver rule because the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice entitled both the trial judge and the State to rely upon the defense counsel's voluntary agreement to a trial date.</SPAN></P>

The State contended that the activities constituted lotteries which violated Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a complaint alleging that the churches were conducting lotteries contrary to Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 6. The trial court, on the parties' stipulations, issued a permanent injunction precluding the churches from conducting lotteries in general, and bingo and raffles in particular. The churches admitted sponsoring bingo on a nonprofit basis for charitable purposes, but otherwise denied the allegations. On appeal, the churches argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in holding part of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.01(E)&nbsp;unconstitutional by declaring that the Ohio General Assembly did not have the authority to prohibit lotteries conducted for profit without prohibiting lotteries conducted not for profit. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the trial court erred in granting injunctive relief. The court reasoned that Ohio's constitutional prohibition against lotteries was not self-executing, and therefore the statutory enactment prohibited only gambling for profit. Absent a legislative enactment also banning lotteries or gambling for charitable purposes, the constitutional provision could not be the basis for an injunction against the churches.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The host driver discharged the 16-year-old passenger and a companion in the middle lane of a four-lane highway in the middle of the block. The other driver's car struck the passenger as he attempted to cross two lanes of traffic. On appeal, the court held that the Ohio guest statute, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4512.02, had been deemed unconstitutional and invalid and could not support summary judgment. The court found that the issue of whether the passenger was guilty of contributory negligence when he voluntarily left the vehicle was an issue for the jury because reasonable minds could differ as to whether he took the safeguards for his own protection that a reasonable person would have taken under the circumstances. The court noted that the passenger could have felt that he had no choice but to depart the car. The court also found that proximate cause was a jury issue although the passenger failed to cross the closest travel lane because there was evidence of oncoming traffic and the inferences from such evidence, when construed most favorably to the passenger as the nonmovant, showed a frightened 16-year-old who acted reasonably under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner wished to remodel the second story of a building that he owned as living quarters. However, the remodeling was prohibited under &sect; 150.080 because the building was located in a commercial district. The landowner filed a subsequent action against the city seeking to declare &sect; 150.080 unconstitutional. After examining the evidence, the trial court found that the remodeling of the landowner's property would not have an adverse affect on the city's health, safety, morals, and welfare. The trial court further found that the city's refusal to grant the landowner's request for a variance was an unconstitutional abuse of police power. The city appealed the trial court's subsequent decision enjoining it from enforcing &sect; 150.080. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's judgment. The court recognized that the characteristics of the neighborhood where the building was located had changed. The court further recognized that the testimony presented at trial indicated that 23 apartments in the neighborhood were used as residences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners had maintained a small retail shoe business at their residence. Seventeen years later the neighboring property owners lodged a complaint with the building inspector about the property owners' business operations. The property owners eventually moved for a non-conforming use certificate to authorize the property owners to continue in business, which was granted. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the county zoning resolution was indispensable for the court's consideration, but had not been placed into evidence or otherwise made a part of the record. The court found that it was not required to take judicial notice of the resolution. The court ruled that administrative regulations had to officially be made a part of the record. Thus, without the resolution the neighboring property owners could not show prejudicial error. The court found that there were no deficiencies in the proceedings of the Board and that the neighboring property owners were accorded their rights. Thus, additional evidence pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Defendants maintained that the Toledo, Ohio, General Offense Code &sect; 17-4-105(A) allowed the conduct engaged in by them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police arrested one defendant as the keeper of a place of public accommodation where gambling was permitted and also arrested three other defendants for making bets and playing the game of crap in a place of public accommodation. Defendants claimed that the gambling operation was conducted by and under the promotion of a charitable corporation not for profit and that all income was used solely for charitable purposes. The trial court found defendants guilty, and they appealed. In affirming the convictions, the court held that &sect; 17-4-105 did not specifically allow the conduct engaged in by defendants. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.01 et seq. and the relevant city ordinances were identical. The court stated that once a city established that gambling was being conducted within the purview of the statutes, it could be inferred that such activity was for profit, and it was incumbent upon defendants, under Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 2901.05(C)(2) relative to affirmative defenses, to establish that they came within the exception found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;2915.01(E). The court concluded that defendants' conduct was an obvious ruse to circumvent Ohio gambling laws.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the husband raised eight assignments of error. The court rejected all of defendant's arguments. The court found that the trial court had the equitable power to consider the husband's aggression toward the wife when it considered whether to award alimony. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.18(A) did allow the trial court to award both real and personal property together with money as alimony. The court further found that the trial court had considered sufficient relevant factors, as outlined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.18(B) when it determined that the wife was disabled an unable to work when it awarded alimony to the wife. The court also pointed out that the trial court was aware of all the circumstances when it formulated its child support order and did not violate Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees sought damages for injuries that stemmed from their employment related use of certain chemicals.

On appeal, the court disagreed, reasoning that the Act did not unreasonably limit the employees' right to be fully compensated for work related injuries. The court noted that the Industrial Commission was vested with the authority to award sums beyond compensation benefits when an employer failed to comply with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court abused its discretion when it imposed the maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years. The court, however, found that the record indicated a joint purpose to commit a small organized crime spree by obtaining blank checks through burglary and passing bad checks in a series of offenses. There was a history of prior felonies by defendant and he failed to appear on the first trial date after which a capias was issued for his arrest. Hence, the record strongly supported the sentence. Defendant also claimed a denial of constitutional fairness because a co-defendant, who entered a plea to a lesser offense, and who testified for the State, was granted probation. The court held that disparity in sentences did not establish either unfairness or a penalty for going to trial. Although the co-defendant physically removed the stolen property, the evidence implicated defendant as the motivating factor in the burglary offense. The record and the flight and conduct of defendant supported the disparity in the sentences. Finally, defense counsel's cross-examination of the State's witnesses was a matter of judgment and not incompetence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation had filed a bankruptcy petition and had been granted a discharge. A state department of taxation then determined that the debt was uncollectible from the corporation and attempted to reassess against the taxpayer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.33. The taxpayer argued that the trial court erred when it found that a notice of assessment sufficiently notified the taxpayer that such assessment was against the taxpayer personally and when it found that the assessment procedure of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.13 met the procedural requirements of due process of law. In reversing, entering judgment in favor of the taxpayer, and remanding the cause, the court found that the notice of assessment did not afford the taxpayer procedural due process under U.S. Const. amend XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The title on the assessment appeared to be concerned with the corporation and not with the taxpayer as an individual.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner argued that Claridon, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 803 was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred when it failed to find that the owner was prejudice as a result of the action of the zoning inspector. On appeal, the court found that a portion of &sect; 803 was invalid and contrary because it was contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 519, which intended that the zoning inspector be charged with the issuance of zoning certificates. Thus, the portion of Claridon, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 803 that stated that the zoning commission authorized the issuance of zoning certificates was invalid. Elimination of that portion of &sect; 803 resulted in no provision for obtaining a zoning certificate for a commercial or industrial use. Thus, the owner suffered prejudice. However, the court found that the prohibition of the owner's intended use was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Many residents opposed the owner's use of the premises for a junkyard because of the noise and other characteristics of a nuisance. The owner failed to demonstrate any undue hardship to warrant a variance because the premises could be used for permitted commercial uses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, Commissioners of Columbiana County, Ohio, sought review of a judgment of the Columbiana County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which reversed and remanded a decision of the Commissioners denying the application for annexation of land to a city by appellee petitioners for the annexation. The common pleas court found the denial illegal because it did not comply with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition for annexation of land to the city with the Commissioners was refused upon a vote of two to one after complying with all procedural steps. A predominant recorded reason for the refusal existed regarding the annexation boundaries. The refusal was appealed to the common please court, who remanded the action to the Commissioners with instructions to approve the petition. The Commissioners contended that the remand was improper citing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 307.56, 2506.04, 2506.01 without relating all or any to the alleged error. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033, the ultimate focus of the annexation proceedings must have been on the general good of the territory, wherein annexation was sought. There was a finding of fact by a dissenting Commissioner that the general good of the territory wherein annexation was sought would have been served for a number of reasons. The findings created a preponderance of evidence that the general good of the territory would have been served. The common pleas court, upon arriving at such findings consistent with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04, was correct in remanding the cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that section 913.25G was null and void, being in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4511.211, 723.231. The court stated that Linndale, Ohio, Ordinance 913.25(G), as amended by Linndale, Ohio, Ordinance 74-10, was not in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.211. Both the statute and the ordinance provided that no person should operate a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding 55 miles per hour on freeways with paved shoulders inside municipal corporations. Both provided a maximum fine for a first offense of speeding between 55 and 60 miles per hour. If defendant was convicted of speeding at a rate over 60 miles per hour, both provided more severe penalties. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 723.231 was nonexistent. The court held that the legislature had the power to provide for prosecution for crime without the intervention of a jury, except when imprisonment was made a part of the punishment. After reviewing the evidence, the court found no evidence that the trial court violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2938.08. A patrolman's testimony, if believed, was sufficient evidence to support this conviction and to overcome defendant's presumption of innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with aggravated robbery and kidnapping. The trial court dismissed the charges because the State did not bring her to trial within the statutory period set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.71, 2945.72 and 2945.73. On appeal, the State argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the separate powers between legislative act and judicial superintendence of the Ohio Constitution. The State argued, in essence, that the standards set forth in the statutory speedy trial statute were inconsistent with the constitutional standards of speedy trial. The court rejected the State's argument. The court pointed out that Ohio C.P. Superintendence R. 8(B) did not control here because it was merely a record keeping provision designed to assist the Ohio Supreme Court in allocating judicial resources to the criminal justice system. Further, the court noted that this rule was enacted pursuant to Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(A)(1), which was the constitutional power to enact administrative, record-keeping rules. Further, the legislative rule had created a substantive right that took precedence over a conflicting procedural rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder in the death of a police officer. After a finding of the absence of any of the mitigating factors under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B), the trial court sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for the reason that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.01, 2929.02, 2929.03 and 2929.04&nbsp;unconstitutionally permitted arbitrary imposition of the death penalty in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the Ohio statutes permitting the impositions of the death penalty did not permit an arbitrary imposition of the death penalty and were not constitutionally impermissible. Rather, the death penalty statutes provided narrower definitions of crimes for which the death penalty could be imposed and gave standards to follow in determining the sentence in capital cases. Thus, the death penalty statutes did not unconstitutionally permit arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal, inter alia, that he could not be convicted of aggravated murder because the State failed to prove that the homicide occurred during the commission of an attempted aggravated robbery; but instead, he claimed the evidence proved that at the time of the homicide, defendant and his companion were fleeing from an attempted aggravated robbery. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence and held that the evidence proved an attempt to commit aggravated robbery, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.02(A) which defined &quot;attempt&quot; as purposely or knowingly, engaging in conduct which, if successful, would result in the offense. The court held that the act necessary in an attempt to commit a felony need not be the last proximate act prior to the consummation of the felony intended to be perpetrated. The court held defendant and his companion clearly had engaged in a series of acts or movements toward the execution of their plan to rob and the prosecution was not required to prove the last proximate act prior to the commission of the robbery, i.e., that a gun had been shoved in the belly of the manager and a demand made for his money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former probationary patrolman was serving the second half of a one-year probationary period in the city's police department when he was notified by the city manager in writing of the reasons that he would not be appointed as a permanent patrolman.

The patrolman unsuccessfully sought injunctive and declaratory relief due to his inability to appeal the cause of his discharge to the Commission. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against the patrolman by finding that, as a probationary employee in the second half of his probationary period, the patrolman could be removed from his position without a right of appeal to the Commission pursuant to the non-arbitrary, rational, and reasonable Cincinnati, Ohio, Civ. Serv. Comm'n R. X, &sect; 4. As the patrolman's appointment was not final pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners sought review of a decision of the Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), made pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board denied the landowners' permit application on grounds that the property did not have the required amount of parking under Ordinance No. 1125.05(12), which required a minimum of the greater of 50 spaces, a number of spaces based on the size of the building, or a number of spaces based on the seating within a restaurant, bar, or tavern. The trial court found that a packet of documents was the transcript of the Board's proceedings on the application, and it allowed the landowners to present additional evidence on appeal. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that sustained the Board's denial of the application. Ordinance No. 1125.05(12) was constitutional, was in the best interest of the district to which it applied, and was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The appeal before the trial court was in compliance with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506. The trial court properly admitted additional evidence in the proceedings before it. Summary judgment was not a remedy available to the landowners under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03. The trial court's decision in affirming the Board's decision was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that affirmed the Board's denial of the landowners' application for an occupancy permit. The court found reasonable grounds for the appeal, awarded the Board costs from the landowners, and ordered a special mandate to direct the trial court to execute its judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his administrative license suspension after a hearing in the Bedford Municipal Court (Ohio) for refusing to take a blood alcohol test as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191, which was Ohio's informed consent statute. Defendant had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that because an affidavit sent by the arresting officer to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles was blank in the space provided for listing the specific type of test that defendant refused, his license suspension was void. The court disagreed. Ohio Revised Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(D) did not mandate that the affidavit had to recite the specific test that was refused. There was credible evidence that a breathalizer was offered, so that determination was not disturbed on appeal. Further, the scope of judicial review was limited by Ohio Revised Code &sect; 4511.191(F) to matters that did not include whether a specific test was listed in the officer's affidavit. Defendant had no right to counsel at the time the test would have been administered so he was not entitled to be told that he had a right to counsel. A blood alcohol test is not a proceeding within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.84.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. It was ordered that the State recover of defendant its costs taxed on appeal. There were reasonable grounds for the appeal. It was ordered that a special mandate issue out of the court directing the trial court to carry the court's judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment creditor filed a complaint on an account against the judgment debtor, along with an affidavit for attachment before judgment, alleging that the judgment debtor would convert the payment to be made by the insurance company for the purpose of placing it beyond the reach of her creditors. The insurance company was ordered to pay the funds into the trial court, and the judgment debtor's motion to quash the attachment was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2715.50, attachment before a debt was due was proper where a debtor was about to make a disposition of property with fraudulent intent. That ground for attachment fell within the category of extraordinary situations that justified postponing notice and opportunity for a hearing, namely, those cases in which a creditor made a showing of immediate danger that a debtor would destroy or conceal disputed goods. The affidavit attached to the complaint set forth allegations and facts within the contemplation of &sect; 2715.50, and the special need for very prompt action. The prejudgment attachment statute was found to be constitutional, and did not violate the judgment debtor's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for robbery and murder, assigning 11 errors. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected the contention that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded defendant's aggravated murder conviction because his accomplice had previously been acquitted on the same charge. Noting that requiring consistent verdicts in different trials was a usurpation of the jury's power as the trier of fact, the court found that estoppel did not operate to excuse defendant, who was not a party to the earlier trial. The court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress a photographic array and subsequent in-court identification, noting that there was nothing suggestive in the separate submission of the photos to the witnesses. The court found that the trial court had properly overruled defendant's motion for a mistrial based upon a bailiff's response to a juror's question about sentencing procedures, noting that the mandate against communication in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.33 applied to matters concerning the case being tried, rather than matters relating to the supervision of the jury.</SPAN></P>

The trial court permanently enjoined appellants from conducting summer stock theatre in a private school. The trial court found that the use of the theatre was an unauthorized commercial use in a residential district in violation of a zoning resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessor and lessee agreed to the use of the school's auditorium by the partnership for performances by the theatre. The court construed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3313.75-3313.77 in pari materia. The court concluded that the Ohio General Assembly intended that public schoolhouses serve as civic centers for lawful uses that did not interfere with the general education of the young. The court held that, when a school was a permitted use under the terms of a zoning resolution, such permitted uses included all lawful uses to which the school might be put. The court held that where the permitted school use included both private and public schools, a private school could put its school facilities to the same lawful uses as a public school could. The court concluded that the charging of a fee for the permitted entertainment of plays--by the partnership that lawfully leased the private school's premises--did not constitute a commercial use that violated the zoning resolution. The court decided that the fact that some of the additional uses to which school facilities might be lawfully put involved the charging of an admission fee was incident to the permitted uses and did not limit them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of an order entered by the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals dismissing its appeal from a final order of appellee, the Tax Commissioner of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer's appeal was dismissed by the Board for the reason that the notice of appeal filed by the taxpayer with the Board was not worded with sufficient specificity to give the Board jurisdiction to hear the taxpayer's arguments on the merits. The court noted that the philosophy of the Board and the tax commissioner was one designed to avoid coming to grips with the merits and to procedurally deny to a taxpayer a merit hearing on a technicality, although it had timely filed a notice of appeal. The majority of the court believed that this degree of specificity was not required by statute or prior judicial statements. Administrative tribunals were to assist in the administration of justice and they were generally given more liberality than courts, and the technical rules applicable to judicial proceedings should not have applied. Thus it would have been an anomaly to enlarge upon the rule of specificity in a notice of appeal to an administrative tribunal beyond that required by judicial precedent. The taxpayer's assignment of error alleging that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.02 was unconstitutional was not well taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on evidence obtained in a building inspector's warrantless entry and inspection of defendant's apartment building, defendant was charged with violating &sect; 1101-54. The court granted defendant's motion to suppress all evidence that was obtained during that inspection and found that the inspection violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Because the inspector entered private property, it did not matter that there were common areas on the premises because those areas were common only to the building's tenants or their guests, not to the public at large. The court rejected the prosecution's argument that, because of the nature of the premises, defendant did not have an expectation of privacy in the area that was inspected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DWI) after he was found asleep in a parked vehicle. The officer found defendant asleep and sitting in the driver's seat behind the wheel, with both hands on the wheel. The results of the psychomotor and intoxilyzer tests revealed that defendant was under the influence of alcohol and unfit to drive a vehicle at the time of his arrest. Defendant testified that he was in the vehicle behind the wheel with the motor running at the time of his arrest because it was a cold night, and he wanted to keep warm. The court granted judgment for defendant and found him not guilty of DWI. The court concluded that defendant did not have sufficient actual physical control of the vehicle to sustain a conviction for DWI under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19. The court found that the legislature had changed the wording of the DWI statute in an apparent effort to encourage those who had consumed too much alcohol to pull off the road and not operate a vehicle on the highways. The court held that a city DWI ordinance could not prohibit something that the State statute positively permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Ohio sought to temporarily and permanently enjoin defendant landowners from staging a rock concert at the Toledo Speedway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought to enjoin a rock concert the landowners were staging. It claimed that any land on which a felony drug violation occurred constituted a nuisance subject to abatement and that the court was required to enjoin the concert because felony drug violations occurred at a rock concert previously held at the landowners' premises. The court denied the application for injunctive relief. It found that the staging of a musical production for profit, such as the landowners' rock concert, was entitled to protection under the right of free expression. Further, although the State had a compelling interest in the enforcement of its criminal laws and it had been proven that felony drug violations took place during a prior concert, the State could not enjoin the rock concert because the restriction sought was unconstitutionally overbroad, as it swept protected speech within its proscriptions. Finally, the State failed to show that the landowners' activity was subject to abatement under the nuisance statutes because they lacked culpability in the felony drug violations that have taken place on their property at previous concerts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the enjoining of the concert as a means of controlling illegal drug activity was impermissibly overbroad and that the landowners' activity of holding a concert on their property was not subject to abatement under the nuisance statutes. Accordingly, it denied the State's request for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In making that plea, defendant challenged the procedure by which phencyclidine has been classified as a Schedule II drug rather than a Schedule III drug. Specifically, defendant asserted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.43, insofar as it provided that a transfer by the United States Attorney General of a narcotic from one schedule to another in the federal drug classification scheme automatically effected a corresponding transfer in Ohio's drug schedules, unlawfully delegated legislative authority in the attorney general. The court held that the reclassification resulted in harsher penalties being imposed on those found to have unlawfully possessed that drug. Therefore, the court held that insofar as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.43 delegated the power to the United States Attorney General to modify the law in Ohio, that delegation of authority was unconstitutional and void. Accordingly, the court found defendant not guilty as charged in the indictment, but guilty of violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(C)(2), possession of phencyclidine, a Schedule III drug.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff social worker filed an action against defendant state board of psychology, city psychological association, a state investigator, and the state attorney general because prohibited her from practicing psychotherapy. She sought a declaratory judgment that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4732 was an unlawful delegation of legislative power, damages for anti-trust violations, and for malicious interference with her right to practice social work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature expressly classified psychotherapy as a limited branch of medicine that had to be licensed by the Ohio State Medical Board pursuant to Ohio Rev. Codes Ann. &sect; 4731.15. Psychologists licensed by the Ohio State Psychological Board could practice psychotherapy provided they maintained a consultative relationship with a licensed physician. The social worker's exemption from the licensing requirements for psychologists did not exempt her from the requirements for practicing psychotherapy. The social worker claimed that the two Boards restrictions of psychotherapy to licensed physicians and psychologists violated the anti-trust provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1331. The court concluded that the legislature, not the Boards, correctly imposed the limitation pursuant to its police power. Therefore, the social worker had no anti-trust claims against defendants. The court found that she stated a claim for malicious interference with her right to practice clinical social worker against the state investigator but did not state a claim with respect to the remaining defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted summary judgment to the state board of psychology and the city psychological association. The state investigator was granted summary judgment on all but the social worker's complaint for malicious interference with her right to practice social work. The court dismissed the counts against the state attorney general.</SPAN></P>

The patient mailed a notice of contemplated action to the doctor and subsequently filed a medical malpractice claim against the doctor 182 days after he mailed the notice. The doctor filed a motion to dismiss the action contending that it was time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A), which the court treated as a motion for summary judgment. The court found that the question of whether the 180 extension to the 1-year statute of limitation provided for in &sect; 2305.11(A) ran from the expiration of the 1-year statute of limitation or from the date that notice of the action was filed was a question of first impression. The court concluded the statutes were to be construed to effect their purpose and that one of the purposes of the statute of limitations was to promote the early filing of claims. Accordingly, the court held that the 180-extension period ran from the filing of notice, thus the patient's action was time-barred because it was filed 182 days after notice was given.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court overruled the motion to dismiss. The court held that &sect; 2903.07, vehicular homicide, was a crime of negligent conduct as enacted by the criminal code. The court stated that it was not a traffic offense that could be charged on a uniform traffic ticket. The court found that vehicular homicide, when committed by a juvenile, was an act of delinquency, not a juvenile traffic offense, and was properly charged on a complaint, not a uniform traffic ticket.

The court denied the creditor's request and scheduled a hearing on the constitutional issues. The debtor contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2737 provided for the taking of personal property without due process of law, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, in that there was no provision for pre-seizure notice or hearing. The court observed that a replevin statute, in order to satisfy due process requirements, had to provide for a detailed affidavit by the creditor, judicial control of the replevin process, and a right to a speedy post-seizure hearing when requested by the debtor. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2737 failed to provide due process because it contained no provision for a speedy post-seizure hearing to determine the validity of the ex parte seizure. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2737.04, which provided for the right of return of seized property to a debtor upon the posting of bond, was constitutionally inadequate.

The local court rules provided that the father was required to pre-pay the costs associated with the blood test, which was needed to prove or refute paternity. The father filed a motion, which alleged that the tests should have been taxed as costs because he was indigent and did not have the necessary costs for the blood test. The father contended that the local court rule was unconstitutional because the blood tests were a vital part of the paternity proceeding and the requirement of prepayment of costs denied him a vital defense because of his status as an indigent person. The court denied the father's motion for blood tests unless payment for the tests was made in advance in accordance with the provisions of the rule because the requirement that a party make advance payment for a blood test was not a denial of access to the court. Requiring the father to pay in advance for the blood tests as a condition precedent to the granting of his motion for blood tests was not a violation of due process and equal protection because paternity actions were completely civil and had no attributes of a criminal case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Ordinance deprived a minor of his rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that those rights were fundamental rights, and that there was no &quot;compelling state interest&quot; shown. The court found that the Ordinance was in addition violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The city agreed to withhold prosecution for alleged violation of the ordinance by reason of having on display more than four devices popularly called &quot;pinball&quot; machines in their place of business until the court rendered its decision. Upon review, the court declared the ordinance unconstitutional. The court found that no evidence was provided that would indicate that rowdyism, assaults, fights, drunkenness, brawls, and the like were caused by the display of these mechanical devices. The court stated that it was unlikely that elementary children would frequent any of the neighboring liquor permit premises where such mechanical devices were proposed to be regulated. The court held that the ordinance created an arbitrary classification between mechanical amusement games, such as pinball machines and non-mechanical amusement games, such as bowling, darts or pool that were fundamentally the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner operated a home occupation or business from her residence. Section 115(f) prohibited her from advertising the home business in mass media publications. The owner argued that &sect; 115(f) was unlawful in that it was not within the regulatory power granted to the township pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.02. The owner also argued that the resolution violated her First Amendment rights. The court agreed with both assertions and granted the requested relief. The court held that the purpose of Montville, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 115(f) was to restrain the dissemination of information presumed protected by the First Amendment, commercial advertising. Therefore, the township bore the burden of demonstrating that the restraint so imposed comported with the substantive and procedural requirements of the First Amendment, which it failed to do because its purpose in preventing the owner's business in becoming too large for the residential was not justified by the restraint. Additionally, such regulation was in conflict with the authority granted to the township pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.02. Accordingly, the resolution was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Akron, Ohio, City Code &sect; 648.01. Defendants argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional on the basis of vagueness and of overbreadth and that any judicial interpretation narrowing said vagueness and overbreadth would deny defendants due process. Defendants claimed that the definition of &quot;loitering&quot; in the ordinance was so vague and elastic that readers must necessarily guess at its meaning. The court found that the statute specified that the proscribed offense was loitering for the purpose of engaging in, or soliciting another person to engage in, sexual activity for hire. The court concluded that such a narrow concept was not vague and did not infringe upon areas of constitutionally protected activity. The court also rejected defendants' claim that the ordinance did not contain ascertainable standards of guilt. The court found that the ordinance included a list of guidelines relating to the intent of the offending party by delineating instances of overt conduct that an officer could consider in determining whether there was loitering with the purpose of engaging in prostitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The will of the deceased was filed in probate court and the wife of the deceased was appointed administratrix of the estate. The wife filed a claim against the estate for the amount. The heirs of the decedent filed a motion to dismiss the wife's claim. The heirs argued that because the wife had not personally signed the claim, the claim had not been properly filed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.02. The court stated that there was no authority that the executor of an estate's claim had to be personally signed. Secondly, the heirs argued that because the hearing on the claim was not scheduled within the time limits set forth by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.02, the claim was barred. The court stated that a right to contribution from the estate was predicated upon the wife showing that she had paid more than her just proportion of a joint obligation owed by her and her deceased husband. Upon such a showing, the estate was liable for such excess. The court found that the wife as the surviving spouse was entitled to contribution from the estate for half of the total amount she actually expended on the joint obligation. Thus, the claim was not time barred.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were charged with misdemeanors that occurred prior to the effective date of the new statutes. All but two of the complaints were filed in either the mayor's courts or the county courts before the effective date of the new statutes. The cases were then transferred to the court under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.04. Defendants filed motions to dismiss on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction of their cases. The court overruled the motions. The court found that it had no jurisdiction except that granted by statute. However, the court further found that the legislature in enacting &sect; 1901.04 did not intend that the cases pending in the mayor's courts and the county courts would simply cease to exist. The court held that defendants' contention that for &sect; 1901.04 to be effective it had to specifically mention by name the newly created court was without merit. The court noted that there was no problem of territorial jurisdiction and that &sect; 1901.04 gave the court specific jurisdiction of defendants' cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City was a planned community. A portion of the City was zoned for residential use only. The corporation sought to have its land rezoned as a planned unit development and the remainder of the land rezoned to permit the building of a shopping center. The city council passed the zoning change as to the planned unit development but rejected the proposed shopping center. The issue was placed on a referendum during an election, and the citizens rejected the planned unit development zoning. The corporation filed a declaratory judgment action against the City. The court held that the action of the council and the referendum, representing an overwhelming majority of the vote, were not so clearly arbitrary or unreasonable that the failure to rezone was unconstitutional. The City advanced reasons for its failure to rezone, which outweighed the corporation's economic loss. The City was concerned with the appearance of stability and the attracting of desirable homebuyers to its community. It further claimed that an added shopping center was not needed or wanted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation filed an application for a declaratory judgment, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.03, against defendants, the Attorney General of the State of Ohio and the Director of the Ohio Department of Commerce, asserting that sections of the Consumer Sales Practices Act, specifically, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1345.03 and 1345.02, were unconstitutional. Defendants filed a counterclaim against the corporation's officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff's complaint for declaratory relief asserted that &sect;&sect; 1345.03 and 1345.02, which prohibited unconscionable and deceptive acts and practices in connection with a consumer transaction, were unconstitutional. In addition, it filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim against its corporate officers, alleging, inter alia, that the officers were not subject to personal liability under the Act. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint. The court held that declaratory relief was not warranted because the controversy before the court had progressed to the point where there was a wrong to remedy. Plaintiff had already acted in establishing its business practices, and failed to show that its rights would be impaired or lost. The court allowed defendants' counterclaim alleging that the corporate officers were personally responsible for violations of the Act. It rejected plaintiff's assertion that the Act did not specifically include corporate officers within the definition of suppliers in &sect; 1345.01(C), holding that the definition included corporate officers as suppliers who were personally liable for their deceptive and unconscionable consumer sales practices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for declaratory relief and denied plaintiff's motion to dismiss defendants' counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a hearing conducted by the board, the chief was suspended for 120 days without compensation. The chief sought judicial review. The court affirmed the board's decision. Implicit with the board's power to remove an employee, conferred under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 505.38, was the authority and right to suspend. The board was not a legal fiction because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 505.371 provided that two or more townships had the authority to unite to create a joint fire district and that the board had the authority to act as a separate legal entity. The action taken by the board was an exercise of its statutory authority to conduct investigative and adjudicative functions and its proceedings was quasi-judicial. Thus, absent some demonstration of prejudice, bias, conflict of interest, or evidence of any denial of due process, the court was required to sustain the board's adjudication. An examination of the charges and the board's findings revealed that they were not vague, overly broad, or misleading. Because the chief did not request the board to clarify, restate, or explain any of its charges or its findings, it was presumed that he knew and understood the board's action.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff asserted that the pleading requirements violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42, that the act was an unconstitutional infringement of judicial function in violation of Ohio Const. art.

The court concluded that plaintiff lacked standing or cause to complain with reference to the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43 because plaintiff did not pray for damages in excess of $ 200,000.00 in general damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which convicted him of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13 by using a firearm after having been previously convicted of a felony of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot a man in the abdomen and mouth while defendant was on probation for carrying a concealed weapon. It was stipulated that defendant was in fear of losing his life and that he felt that he had no other recourse. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 2923.13, and the court affirmed the conviction. The court noted that defendant's prior conviction was for violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12, which prohibited carrying a concealed weapon. The court found that, according to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.02, the term &quot;offense&quot; included felonies and misdemeanors and that a felony conviction under any statute designated as pertaining to an offense of violence necessarily constituted a &quot;felony of violence.&quot; The court further found that, while the offense of carrying a concealed weapon might not have involved actual physical harm, it could involve a &quot;risk of serious physical harm&quot; and, therefore, fell under another definition of &quot;offense of violence&quot; as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01. The court concluded that, in light of federal decisions regarding 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 922, 1202, which were similar to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(2), defendant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>
