The elected official filed an action to have the ordinance declared invalid. The trial court found that the ordinance to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the ordinance deprived the commissioners of their authority to hire and discharge departmental employees; and (2) the adoption of the ordinance without a referendum violated Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(f) because it altered the city's form of government. The court explained that under the ordinance, the subordinate department heads, who had been chosen by the commission had the authority to discharge the elected official, and the commissioners were no longer fully accountable to the electorate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had passed a resolution under authority granted by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, para. 2156 (1975) to authorize the sale of bonds to finance the construction of a new county jail and sheriffs' residence. The chairman was directed to sign the bonds by the resolution but refused to do so. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although the chairman argued that Para. 2156 violated equal protection and the prohibition in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970) against special legislation, the court held that the population floor set by the relevant statute for authorization of construction of new jails was not unreasonable or irrational. The court noted that those counties under the population floor were given powers to be used by resolution to meet their physical needs. The court found no merit to the chairman's constitutional challenge based on certain home rule provisions in the state constitution. Because the resolution only created a ministerial duty in the chairman to sign the bonds, the court held that a writ of mandamus was properly ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal was whether or not the amendment to the Illinois Horse Racing Act as embodied in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 8, para. 39.1 (1977) was unconstitutional, in that the right of the corporate agents to engage in business was unconstitutionally restrained unreasonably and without a proper nexus to a legitimate need. The court held that the corporate agents were engaged in the business of providing a service to their customers not unlike any other messenger service. The corporate agents' activities were misconstrued as activities involving gambling. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional. The public policy of the state was not to completely prohibit gambling and the public policy was to allow wagering under the supervision of the state. The proper remedy for the legislature would have been to regulate the activities of the corporate agents, as a messenger service, for the purpose of being sure that they operate within the framework of the Illinois Horse Racing Act, and not to prohibit their operations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with the murder of his 20 month-old daughter. The charges of rape and deviate sexual assault were added. At a hearing to determine defendant's fitness to stand trial, defendant offered the testimony of a psychiatrist who stated that defendant was unfit. The State offered the testimony of a psychiatrist who indicated that defendant was fit to be tried. The court found defendant fit and ultimately a jury found defendant guilty of murder and deviate sexual assault. The court sentenced defendant on the murder charge. Defendant argued that the statute under which he was found unfit improperly placed the burden of proof on him and that the statute should have properly imposed a reasonable doubt standard of proof. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court held that the statute did improperly place the burden of proof on defendant. Additionally, the court held that a reasonable doubt standard in fitness hearings was not logically or legally required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director suspended the licenses of plaintiffs under the Act for racial discrimination in the rental of an apartment. Plaintiffs filed an action under the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 264 et seq. (1973), for review of the suspension. The circuit court reversed the suspension. Defendants appealed and asserted that the suspension should be reinstated because para. 8(e)(1), (3), (11), (14), (17) of the Act and rule VII of the Rules and Regulations for the Administration of the Act could be construed to prohibit racially discriminatory conduct. Plaintiffs asserted that the Act should be strictly construed and that it was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that: (1) the Act could be construed to prohibit racially discriminatory conduct and rule VII clearly prohibited such conduct, (2) rule VII was applicable because the salesmen were obligated to find tenants, (3) the evidence was sufficient to support the suspension as to the salesmen, and (4) there was no evidence to support the suspension as to the real estate broker.</SPAN></P>

The actions were brought pursuant Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127 1/2, para. 35 (1975). The owners raised numerous arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the petitions of the owners, the trial court entered an order establishing a fire protection district, following an election. Consolidated hearings were held on the 135 petitions for disconnection. Testimony showed the district's ability to provide fire protection based on levied taxes. The owners sought disconnection to obtain fire protection from another district based on cost and proximity issues. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the trial court's determinations were not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. When property did not have the requisite territorial qualifications for inclusion in the district, it allowed the disconnection. The owners did not sustain their burden of proof that the disconnection of their properties did not impair the ability of the district to provide fully adequate fire protection to the remaining properties. The stipulations and consolidated proceedings allowed the trial court findings to apply to all the owners. The court found that a prior quo warranto proceeding was res judicata as to the question of validity of existence of the district, and precluded the owners from questioning the existence of the district.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pled guilty to rape in front of one judge, and was found guilty of aggravated kidnapping at a jury trial presided over by another judge. At sentencing, defendant agreed that both judges would hear the evidence before rendering separate sentences for each conviction. On appeal, defendant challenged the propriety of this procedure. The court found no error after determining that the requirements of &sect; 5-4-1(a),(b) (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-4-1(a),(b) (1975)) of the Unified Code of Corrections were met. The fact that the two judges may have conferred before imposing their sentences was not prohibited, but rather was an encouraged practice. The specific intent of the aggravated kidnapping charge was proven beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the proof that the victim was confined and transported by automobile by defendant. Defendant's failure to comply with &sect; 67(2) of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 67(2) (1975), waived any alleged errors in the jury instructions.

The superintendent refused and relator filed a petition seeking access to the records.

The trial judge denied the petition, finding that the relief sought would cause great disorder and financially wreck the district, and that the relief sought was too broad. The relator appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the denial and remanded for entry of an order issuing a writ of mandamus. The court found that under &sect; 3a of the Local Records Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 116, para. 43.103a (1975), records concerning the use of public funds were public records available for inspection. The court found that records of salary expenditures were public records, and that such disclosure would not invade the employees' privacy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action against defendants, an automobile owner and operator, to recover for damages allegedly sustained in a collision. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the action was not timely filed. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) approved a question for review as to whether an age of majority statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 22 (1969), was unconstitutional as applied to bar plaintiff's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although there was a two-year general statute of limitations, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para 15 (1973), at the time plaintiff was injured, the Limitations Act provided at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 22 (1969) that if the person entitled to bring an action was, at the time the cause of action accrued, within the age of 21 years, or if a female, within the age of 18 years, he or she might bring the action within two years after the disability of being a minor was removed. Under application of this provision, plaintiff's action was untimely filed. The court held that the provision of different ages of majority for men and women constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV as well as Ill. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. It was uncontroverted that if plaintiff were a male, her suit would have been timely filed. She therefore was the target of unconstitutional statutory discrimination and to bar her suit upon application of the Limitations Act would deny her the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's probation was subsequently revoked, and he was sentenced to a prison term of two to six years. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly refused to credit him with time served on probation or for time spent in the county jail as a condition of probation. The court held that the Unified Code of Corrections gave the trial judge discretion in giving credit for defendant's time spent on probation. The court further held that the denial of such credit did not violate the double jeopardy clause. The court, however, held that defendant was entitled to credit for the three weekends that he spent in jail as a condition of his probation. The court determined that defendant was entitled to 14 days credit for the time served as a condition of probation. Finally, the court refused to allow defendant credit for the 20 days that he spent in jail prior to receiving probation because defendant had already been given credit for that time.</SPAN></P>

Others testified that they saw defendants in the area at the time of the shootings. The reviewing court upheld the convictions. The fact that the prosecution did not disclose that two witnesses faced juvenile proceedings did not constitute a Brady violation because defendants did not request any information regarding the witnesses' juvenile records and the information did not create a reasonable doubt as to defendants' guilt. One witness' false testimony that there were no juvenile proceedings pending against him did not require reversal of the convictions. There was no misconduct on the part of the state and there was no evidence that the witness did not tell the truth as he understood it to be.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People sought to oust the commissioners on the ground that the incorporation of the airport authority was invalid. The People argued that the county was a municipal corporation with the requisite statutory population that owned and operated an airport, that the territory of the airport authority embraced part of federally owned land, that the notice of election incorrectly described the proposed airport authority's territory, and that the Municipal Airport Authorities Act (Act) was unconstitutional. The trial court found that all the commissioners lawfully held their office and dismissed the People's complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court agreed that the county was a municipal corporation. However, there was no proof that the county had the requisite population. The state, through its airport authority, was not prevented from rearranging its boundaries where there was no interference with federal jurisdiction. The description in the notices was sufficient. The court did not consider the validity of &sect; 2.2 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 15 1/2, para. 68.2b (1975), because no one was aggrieved. No municipality was partially in and partially outside of the territory.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.1 et seq. (1975) and the Illinois Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq. (1975).</SPAN></P>

He sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief and declaratory relief against the department store and state officials, alleging that emission control parts bought at retail were exempt from sales and use taxes as &quot;pollution control facilities.&quot; The trial court dismissed claim against the store because it had already paid the buyer's use tax to the state and issued injunctive relief, ruling that the parts purchased by the buyer were exempt from taxation. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that replacement or repair parts for servicing and maintaining an automobile's manufacturer-installed emission control system were not &quot;pollution control facilities&quot; exempt from taxation under Use Tax Act &sect; 2a, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.2a (1975) or Retailers' Occupation Tax Act &sect; 1a, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440a (1975). The court found that the emission control system was an integral part of the automobile, not an independent system, and that replacement or repair parts became part of the automobile's emission control system, which was not a pollution control facility under the acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State obtained an injunction from a circuit court to prevent defendant's practice of dentistry without a license. Defendant claimed that he practiced denture therapy and did not need a license. When defendant continued to practice, he was held in contempt for violating the injunction. The court affirmed, holding that the contempt finding was in accord with the manifest weight of the evidence. Once the circuit court entered the injunction, even if it was erroneous, it had to be obeyed until set aside and disobedience of it was properly punishable as a contempt. Defendant could not collaterally attack the injunction. The court also rejected defendant's argument that his motion to strike the petition to show cause should have been allowed on the ground that it did not state whether the contempt was criminal or civil or what punishment, if any, was sought. The show cause order informed defendant that the matter was a criminal contempt, but that the contempt was minor. Defendant did not show that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the defects when he did not allege that he was not sufficiently informed of the nature of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent established a trust that maintained a museum collection. The museum ceased public admission, and the trust declined further funding. The attorney general filed an action to enforce the trust's terms. The trial court granted the trust's motion to dismiss finding that the Charitable Trust Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 14, paras. 51-64, did not apply because the trust did not maintain property for charitable purposes. The trial court, however, refused to declare the act unconstitutional. Both parties appealed the judgment. The court held that the broad legal concept of charitable purposes embraced the corporate purpose of the trust, as set forth in its articles of incorporation. The court additionally held that it was obvious that the decedent did not establish the trust with the intent of distinguishing between educational and charitable purposes. Thus, the trust was subject to the provisions of the act. With regard to its constitutionality, however, the court held that the trust's assertion that the charitable trust classification created by the act was patently arbitrary was not supported by any persuasive arguments.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order dismissing plaintiff's class action. The court found that the evidence established that the class was numerous such that separate litigation would have been impractical. Plaintiff would fairly and adequately protect the class interests and plaintiff was a member of the class because he was convicted under the unconstitutional statute. Further, there was no proof that plaintiff was incapable of performing the functions of a class representative. Common questions of law and fact existed, defendants' liability was established, and the common right to recover predominated over individual questions. Finally, the class action would fairly and efficiently adjudicate the controversy and the rights of numerous claimants would be resolved in one suit and would avoid the economic impediment of individual filing and attorney fees.

On appeal, defendant three argued the presumption of guilt contained in para. 24-1(c) was unconstitutional because it allowed him to be convicted on a quantum of evidence less than that allowed by the reasonable doubt standard. In the alternative, he argued the presumption failed under the more-likely-than-not standard. Defendant one asserted his sentence was excessive based on the facts that he was 29-years-old, married, supported two young children, and had never before been convicted of a felony. The court affirmed defendant one's sentence because the severity of the crime was great and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sentence. The court, however, reversed defendant three's judgment of conviction because the State could not properly invoke the presumption of guilt and thus, it was error to find defendant three guilty of unlawful use of weapons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the trial court was called to order at 9 a.m., defendant sat in the second row of the courtroom without any clothing; his clothes were strewed on a floor by his feet. There were approximately 100 people in the courtroom. The trial judge ordered defendant removed from the courtroom. Sometime between 10:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the morning cases had been disposed of, defendant was brought back before the judge at which time the judge cited him for direct contempt of court and ordered that he be incarcerated. The court stated that while defendant's removal prevented a continuation of the disturbance, it was his initial act of appearing naked in the courtroom, which caused the disturbance for which the contempt order and sentence were imposed. The delay between defendant's act and the entering of the contempt order was reasonable under the circumstances: Defendant had to be clothed, lest the disturbance continued and the judge, to restore order, proceeded to conduct the business of the court as usual. Based upon defendant's conduct, the trial court could properly infer that defendant possessed the requisite intent for a finding that he was in direct criminal contempt of court.</SPAN></P>

The police showed the victim a photograph of defendant and a lineup was conducted. Defense counsel was not present as he had not been appointed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the State of Illinois and the Illinois Society of Orthodontists, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held that defendant school was not engaged in the practice of dentistry under &sect; 5 of the Dental Practice Act, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, para. 60 (1975) in plaintiffs' action to enjoin the school from practicing dentistry by diagnosing its students' orthodontic patients.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school taught courses in orthodontics to licensed dentists and was approved by the Illinois Superintendent of Public Instruction. However, it was not an accredited dental school approved by the Illinois Department of Registration and Education. One of the instructors at the school was an orthodontist and the rest were general dentists. All instructors, except one, were licensed to practice in Illinois. The school's program did not lead to a degree in orthodontics, but provided a licensed dentist additional knowledge in the field of orthodontics. The school also offered a &quot;back-up service,&quot; which provided a student with a diagnosis and treatment plan for one of his patients for a certain amount of money. The court held that the school was in violation of &sect; 5(5) of the Act, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, para. 60(5) (1975) when it diagnosed and recommended treatment for a patient based upon a student's inquiries. As such, the court held that the school, as a corporation, was unlawfully practicing dentistry. The court further held that individual licensed dentists were not forbade from making diagnoses or giving dental advice, as long as it was not done by the school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the judgment in which it was held that the school, as a corporation, did not engage in the unlawful practice of dentistry. The court affirmed the finding that the school was enjoined from representing itself as able to diagnose or prescribe treatment for orthodontic deficiencies. The court also remanded for the entry of an order, enjoining the school from engaging in the unlawful practice of dentistry.</SPAN></P>

Defendants sought review, claiming that their license under the Sale of Exchange Act entitled them to perform check-cashing services. On appeal, the court found that the Sale of Exchange Act license did not entitle them to perform such services, which were solely regulated by the Community Currency Exchange Act. The court also found that a statutory exemption in the Community Currency Exchange Act for retail merchants did not apply.

The warrant specifically encompassed evidence of the possession of a controlled substance, heroin, narcotics, other controlled substances or contraband, money, drug instrumentalities, and paraphernalia used in the manufacture, processing or distribution of controlled substances. The officers searched the premises as well as the patrons. The officers found packages of heroin on the defendant's person. Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, having found no merit to defendant's claim that the warrant did not authorize the search of the patrons. The court noted that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 108- 9 (1975) permits officers to detain a person in a place subject to a warrant in order to protect himself or to prevent disposal of an item named in the warrant. The court found that defendant could easily have concealed or destroyed the heroin and that, because he was there at the time the officers arrived, they had reason to suspect defendant's involvement in any activity being conducted at the bar.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the corporation's property was not used for charitable purposes and, thus, was not exempt from real estate taxes under Ill. Const. 1970 art. IX, &sect; 6. The corporation presented no evidence that it was organized for, or operated under, a charitable purpose as defined in &sect; 6; rather, its purpose was to operate a voluntary health services plan.

On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court reversing the commissioner's order permitting the savings and loan to maintain a facility at an existing location. Specifically, the court determined that the commissioner was not in error and that the required findings of need and no undue injury to existing associations were supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. After a review of the record, the court held that the trial court rested its decision on two points only. The trial court determined that the application by the savings and loan was insufficient, and that the failure to file a bylaw simultaneously with the application were sufficient grounds for reversal of the commissioner's order. However, the court held that the failure of the savings and loan to use a form prescribed by the commissioner and the filing of the bylaws after the application was a technical error only and that no prejudice resulted, pursuant to Ill.

The court stated that there was no necessity for the state to prove that notice of the bail forfeiture was mailed to defendant. Section 110-7(g) of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-7(g) (1971), provided that the accused be mailed a notice that his bond has been ordered forfeited.

The court affirmed both defendants' convictions, holding that the second defendant's statement was not prejudicial to the first defendant because the first defendant was not identified by name. In addition, the prior crimes were admissible given the similarity between the two prior crimes and the crime for which defendants were on trial. The court also affirmed the first defendant's consecutive sentences because the evidence indicated that the first defendant committed both murders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the circuit court, along with a co-defendant, of murder. The court focused on defendant's allegations that there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that he was unconstitutionally denied sufficient cross-examination. The court affirmed. The court noted that Illinois followed the rule that uncorroborated accomplice testimony was a sufficient ground upon which the trier could base a conviction. The issue of whether accomplice testimony, corroborated or uncorroborated, was a satisfactory basis for conviction went to the weight of the evidence and was, therefore, in the province of the jury or the court. Thus, there was no reversible error. The court noted that the latitude to be allowed in the cross-examination of a witness rested largely in the discretion of the trial court, and it was only in a case of an abuse of such discretion resulting in prejudice to a defendant that a reviewing court would interfere. The court agreed with the circuit court that the matters on which defendant sought cross-examination were wholly unrelated to the case.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff challenged the doctrine of contributory negligence for the first time in her motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed.

As an alternative grounds for it decision, the court held that the doctrine of contributory negligence was firmly established in Illinois law and that a finding of contributory negligence barred plaintiff's recovery. The court held that the doctrine of contributory negligence did not violate plaintiff's right to due process or equal protection under either the United States or Illinois Constitutions. The court also held that the doctrine of contributory negligence did not violate plaintiff's rights under Ill. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for attempt murder and aggravated battery in the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois). Defendant claimed that the trial court's finding that defendant was fit to stand trial was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that a jury instruction on the requisite proof necessary for the State to establish defendant's guilt on the attempt murder charge was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant spoke English poorly and had low intelligence. He was a resident of a halfway house when he shot a supervisor who had refused defendant's request to remain in the house. At the fitness hearing, two experts testified for the defense that defendant's intelligence was minimal and that he did not understand the charges against him. An expert for the State testified that defendant was capable of understanding the charge against him. Defendant claimed that the trial court did not apply the proper burden of proof of defendant's fitness to stand trial. The court reversed. It was unclear what burden of proof the trial court used to determine defendant's fitness to stand trial. Once a bona fide doubt had been raised concerning defendant's fitness to stand trial, the burden of proving defendant was fit was on the State. There was plain error in the jury instruction on the requisite mental state for the offense of attempt murder. The instruction given permitted the jury to find defendant guilty of attempt murder even though defendant only had the intent to do great bodily harm. The requisite mental state for the offense of attempt murder was the intent to kill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded for a new fitness hearing.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed the decision and remanded the case in order to determine all of the positions in the office of the Secretary of State and to determine the test scores of all of the individuals who had been terminated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested, when they refused to leave a board of education meeting. After a jury trial, defendants were found guilt of trespass to land, sentenced to a six-month term of conditional discharge, and ordered to pay a $ 50 fine. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court found that defendants' conduct could have been considered symbolic speech because their refusal to leave was based on their desire to communicate their protest of the denial of their rights. The court also found that defendants had the right to associate together to protest the school board's action. Yet, the court reasoned that defendants were not punished for the ideas they sought to express, but rather for the medium they chose to express their ideas. The court found that the request that defendants leave the building after the meeting was over was reasonable because it was not a public meeting place. The court noted that there was no evidence that defendants were singled out for exclusion from the building solely because of their protest. Thus, the court concluded that defendants were not deprived to their First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Woodford County (Illinois), which entered a personal judgment against the owner after the sheriff was unable to sell real property subject to a mechanic's lien foreclosure sale under a default judgment in favor of plaintiff lienor. The owner had previously sold the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner entered into an oral contract with the lienor for surveying services. The lienor completed the work and filed a mechanic's lien on the owner's property. The lienor filed a mechanic's lien foreclosure action and sought an accounting, an adjudication of the superiority of his lien, and an order of sale. The complaint did not seek a personal money judgment. The trial court entered a default judgment of foreclosure and ordered the sale of the property. The sheriff was unable to sell the property because the owner had previously sold it. The lienor moved for a personal judgment against the owner, which was granted, and the owner appealed. In reversing and remanding, the court held that the trial court erred in entering a money judgment subsequent to the entry of a default judgment where the complaint did not request a personal judgment. In cases of default, the relief granted was limited to that requested in the complaint. In addition, a substantial amendment to a complaint under which a default judgment had been entered vacated the default judgment. Finally, to permit a recovery on the contract rather than on the lien would deprive the owner of his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

There was a life insurance policy issued to the husband and mail addressed to him also in the home. Defendants, the husband and wife, were convicted of various illegal drug possession charges. The court affirmed all convictions but the conviction for possession of methaqualone. The court reversed that conviction because at the time of the offense methaqualone was not scheduled as a controlled offense by the legislature. The court also ruled that there was sufficient identification evidence that it was defendant husband at the house from the testimony from an officer who was present at defendants' arrest. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to show that defendants possessed the illegal substances as the drugs were found in a home over which they appeared to exercise exclusive control. The court also held that the admission of other offense evidence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 276 (1973), plaintiff teacher appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Ford County (Illinois), which affirmed defendant board of education's dismissal of the teacher from his teaching job. The teacher contended that the board failed to follow the procedures mandated by &sect; 24-12 of the Illinois School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-12 (1973), for dismissing a tenured teacher for cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board dismissed the teacher following a public hearing wherein students testified regarding his inability to maintain classroom discipline and the principal testified regarding the teacher's failure to take direction. The teacher contended that he was improperly discharged because the board failed to provide him with written warnings prior to his dismissal as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-12 (1973). On appeal, the court noted that prior warnings were required under the statute only when the charges for dismissal were remediable. A cause for dismissal was remediable within the meaning of para. 24-12 if the conduct that damaged the students, faculty, or school could have been corrected if the teacher had prior warnings. In light of the teacher's apparent inability to correct the situation despite discussions with his superiors, the court reasoned that formal notice would not have caused the teacher to correct the conduct that made him unable to control the pupils. Thus, the court held that the teacher was not entitled to prior warnings because the board's determination that the causes were irremediable was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, deciding that while defendant's brief failed to meet the requirements of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 341(e)(1), (2), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 341(e)(1)(2) (1975), the court would nevertheless determine the appeal on its merits. The court held that Illinois' motor vehicle speed limit law was not unconstitutional because such regulation was within the exercise of police power. The court held that probable cause existed for defendant's arrest where the state trooper acted as a cautious and prudent man in relying on a speedgun that was in wide use. The court found that defendant was properly charged with the commission of an offense in that the uniform traffic ticket issued to him met all of the requirements of Ill. Code Crim.

After a hearing, the trial court reversed the board's decision. The board appealed, contending that Rule 309a met constitutional standards of certainty and that the trial court erred by permitting the introduction of additional evidence at its administrative review hearing. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the veterinarian was not denied due process of law when the board decided to suspend his license because there was no unconstitutional vagueness or uncertainty in the plain meaning of Rule 309a. In light of the trial court's reversal of the administrative decision and its finding of unconstitutionality, the veterinarian's volunteered remarks could have unfairly prejudiced the trial court.

The trial court found defendant to be competent. Defendant entered pleas of guilty and sought review of his convictions based on the finding of competency. On appeal, the court determined that the statute under which defendant was found incompetent, Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Lake County Circuit Court (Illinois), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief. Defendant had entered a plea of guilty to a charge of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having shot and killed a victim during the course of an armed robbery. Defendant was subject to the death penalty if convicted of the crime. However, pursuant to plea negotiations, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the murder charge and agreed to testify against his accomplice if the need arose. In exchange, defendant received a sentence of 25-100 years in prison. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court did not properly admonish him as to the possibility of the death penalty being imposed. Secondly, defendant asserted that the cumulative effect of his court-appointed attorney's interpretation of the relevant sentencing statute so frightened defendant as to make his guilty plea coerced rather than voluntary. The court held that there was substantial compliance with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 402 (1973), as to the admonishments. The fact that the admonishments on the circumstances under which the death penalty could be imposed came from defendant's attorney, and not the trial court, was not grounds for reversal. Fear of the death penalty would not invalidate an otherwise valid guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

The property was zoned F for farming when the property was acquired. The landowner was advised at the time of purchase that the property would be zoned R-5 (multi-family residential). The property, however, was later annexed by the city and zoned R-1, which only permitted the construction of two single-family dwellings. The trial court determined that the city's R-1 zoning classification was arbitrary and unreasonable as applied to the landowner's property. The court affirmed because the record amply supported the finding that the landowner established by competent evidence that the R-1 zoning was unjustified and bore no substantial relationship to the public health and safety. What was remarkable about the case was the total lack of any evidence that indicated that the detriment to the landowner bore at least some relationship to the public good. In addition, the court's prior affirmance of a prior refusal to find the zoning classification invalid was not res judicata in light of changed circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to being engaged in the practice of pharmacy, the stores sold many other products, including cosmetics, books, and miscellaneous sundries unrelated to the practice of pharmacy. They were often open for exceedingly long and extraordinary hours. The dispensing of drugs and medicines were conducted in a limited and segregated area of the stores that were accessible to the public only during certain hours regardless of business being carried on in other parts of the stores. The Department determined that the stores were required under the Pharmacy Practice Act to have a registered pharmacist present for a majority of the hours they were open and notified the stores of this. On appeal in the stores' declaratory judgment action, the court affirmed. The court held that because the terms &quot;pharmacy&quot; and &quot;drugstore&quot; as defined in the Act could not reasonably encompass and include the stores, para. 55.1 et seq. did not require the presence of a registered pharmacist for a majority of the hours that the stores were open for general retail business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was a member of the system effective in 1961 and left the state's employ in 1968.

He demanded the payments be resumed and a hearing officer granted his request. The board overruled the hearing officer's report. After his death, his estate sought administrative review and the trial court reversed the system's decision. The court reversed, finding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 14-199 (1975) barred benefits for anyone entering state service after 1955 who was convicted of a service-related felony. The court ruled that the decedent's contractual pension rights incorporated the statute and did not interfere with his contract, and that &quot;felony&quot; under &sect; 14-199 included federal court convictions. The court concluded that &sect; 14-199 did not violate Ill. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5 (1970), which prohibited state retirement benefits from being diminished or impaired, because its 1970 adoption did not affect the decedent's existing contract, and that it did not violate any other federal or state constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants contended that they were denied a fair trial because the trial court prevented them from testifying fully to explain the reasons they fled the scene of the incident in question; that the cause should be remanded for resentencing because the trial court erroneously believed the minimum term of imprisonment for attempt murder was four years; and that imposition of court costs was improper because it was based on an unconstitutional statute, namely, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 180-3 (1975). The court held that defendants were improperly prohibited from presenting evidence to explain why they fled the scene. However, the error was not prejudicial and the outcome of the trial was not affected in view of the overwhelming evidence that established defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the court held that the minimum term of incarceration for attempt murder is four years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' conviction of obscenity.

The first defendant argued that the new trial granted to the third defendant, when the evidence as to both was at least the same, raised a reasonable doubt as to him. The second defendant claimed that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Both defendants contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 111-2(a) (1963) was unconstitutional. The court found that the quantity and quality of the evidence against the first defendant was different and stronger than against the third defendant. Both sides treated the third defendant as acquitted when, as a matter of law, he was not. There was no directed verdict and no arrest of judgment, only a new trial.

Only defendants appealed. They claimed that there were other persons with interests in the property who were not joined as defendants to the suit, that the department did not make an offer to them, and that some owners who had only a life estate were asked to convey the property by warranty deed. In addition, they argued that the department abused the power of eminent domain by taking a fee interest rather than an easement. The court found that the department's actions were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of an attempt to agree found in Ill. Rev.

The police testified that the car was driving at a high rate of speed and that after they stopped the car, one of defendants displayed a gun. Defendants testified that they were traveling at a proper rate of speed and that the officer only discovered defendant's gun by unsnapping her coat. The trial court granted their motion to suppress evidence and quash their arrests. On appeal, the state did not dispute the finding by the trial court that the stop and arrest were illegal, but argued that defendant's display of the gun purged the taint of the illegal arrest. The court affirmed the order suppressing the evidence and quashing the arrests. The court noted that the trial court believed defendants' testimony rather than the officers' with respect to the operation of the car and the confiscation of the weapon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned certain commercial and industrial real estate properties located within a township. The taxpayers' properties were reassessed, while farm and residential property in the township was not similarly reassessed. The taxpayers challenged the reassessments, alleging that they were unconstitutional and unauthorized. The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the taxpayers. The court held that there was no evidence showing that other commercial properties were assessed at a lower percentage rate of actual value than was required by law, and the evidence failed to show that the reassessments violated the constitutional guarantee of uniformity in taxation as set forth in Ill. Const. art. 9, &sect; 4. The trial court also erred in ruling that the board's actions were an attempted classification of properties as there was no evidence that the level of assessment of the taxpayers' properties was different than that of other property in the district. While there were several irregularities in the assessment process, there was no evidence showing that the taxpayers' properties were overvalued, and these violations did not constitute a constructive fraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class of judgment creditors filed suit against the city for allegedly delaying payment of the judgments rendered against it and compelling some judgment creditors to incur a factor's fee or to pay a discount to recover the judgments. The city filed a motion to dismiss the judgment creditors' complaint, which the trial court granted. The judgment creditors appealed. The court determined that in order to maintain a class action, the judgment creditors were required to show a community of interest among the members of the class in both the subject matter of the suit and in the remedy sought. The court held that the complaint contained sufficient allegations of the existence of a community of interest among the members of the class of judgment creditors, who held outstanding judgments against the city at the time of the litigation. However, the court held that the class of judgment creditors who discounted the judgment or incurred a factors' fee did not have a sufficient community of interest because each individual judgment creditor would have had to present individual proof of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions for aggravated battery and armed violence, but reversed four of the convictions for reckless conduct. The court held that the armed violence statute was not unconstitutional, and defendant was not denied due process because the offenses of aggravated assault and armed violence had similar elements. The jury was entitled to conclude that defendant had the requisite mental state to perform the acts constituting the offenses, even though he had been drinking, and the jury verdicts were not legally inconsistent. However, it was improper to hold that while armed with a dangerous weapon defendant committed an assault as to a specific occupant of the house and at the same time recklessly fired a shotgun at the same occupant.

The officer testified that he did not know if the beverage purchased was alcoholic or nonalcoholic. Another officer observed an employee of corporation one completely disrobe and dance two numbers in the nude. Two officers went to corporation two and likewise, purchased drinks for two women employees. As with corporation one, the officers were not aware if the drinks purchased were alcoholic or nonalcoholic. On appeal, the court found that the classification contained within Chicago, Ill., Mun. Ct. R. ch. 147 was arbitrary, unfair, and unreasonable. The classification was over-inclusive because it improperly included the solicitation of nonalcoholic beverages within its proscription. Further, there was no evidence offered to prove that the solicited drinks were alcoholic. Moreover, the prohibitory sections of the ordinance, which were restricted to soliciting beverages in liquor licensed establishments created an unlawful classification, both arbitrary and discriminatory in nature. Additionally, the ordinance was also unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibited nudity in public places.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was a presumption in favor of the validity of a zoning ordinance. The party attacking it had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the ordinance, as applied, was arbitrary and unreasonable and bore no substantial relation to the public health, safety, or welfare of the citizens of the county. The court further noted that the use of property could not be restricted or limited merely because neighboring property owners so desired, or because they thought it might protect the value of their residences. The court found that the bank sustained its burden of proving that the zoning ordinance was not reasonably related to the public health, safety and general welfare.

On appeal, defendants argued that the evidence failed to establish defendants' knowledge of the content of the publications each sold and that they were not proven guilty of obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt. As to the first defendant, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that said defendant had knowledge of the nature or content of the magazine which he sold, or recklessly failed to exercise reasonable inspection which would have revealed its obscene nature and content. In making the sale, said defendant must have been aware of the nature of the cover, which read &quot;Sex Scope,&quot; as well as the magazine's high price. Eyewitness testimony of a bookseller's perusal of a book was not a necessary element in proving his awareness of its contents. The circumstances could warrant the inference that he was aware of what a book contained, despite his denial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lake County, Ill., Liquor Control Ordinance &sect; 11(5) (1973) provided that those who had county liquor licenses could not employ persons younger than 21 as bartenders. Plaintiffs argued that the regulation was invalid and unconstitutional. In affirming the trial court's dismissal of their complaint, the court held that under article IV, &sect; 1 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 110 (1975), the county had the power to prohibit minors from drawing, pouring, or mixing any alcoholic liquor as an employee of any retail licensee. It was immaterial that the Act did not define &quot;minor,&quot; because the Act not only granted the county the power to prohibit minors from working as bartenders but also granted the county authority to establish such further regulations and restrictions as the public good and convenience required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed form the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), following a bench trial, which denied plaintiff, a judgment creditor, relief under an automobile insurance policy issued by garnishee to defendant, a judgment debtor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a judgment that denied plaintiff judgment creditor relief under an insurance policy issued by garnishee to defendant judgment debtor, plaintiff claimed that the Illinois Safety Responsibility Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 7A-101 et seq. (1969), precluded garnishee from rescinding its policy for alleged misrepresentations by defendant. Plaintiff also argued that applications were not made part of the policy, so misrepresentations were not available as a defense. Finally, plaintiff argued that the failure of the trial court to find that garnishee waived its decision to rescind was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that garnishee was able to use misrepresentation defense, because the policy did not become absolute as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 7A-317(f)(1) (1969). Additionally, the court found that declarations in the policy sufficiently complied with Insurance Code &sect; 154, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 766 (1969). Finally, the court rejected the argument that garnishee waived its decision to rescind, because there was no showing that it would have been unjust, inequitable, or unconstitutional to allow the defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower court, which denied plaintiff relief under an auto insurance policy, was affirmed. The court found that the misrepresentation defense was available to garnishee, that the declarations in defendant's policy did not preclude avoidance of the policy, and that garnishee did not waive its decision to rescind because of misrepresentations in the insurance application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

It filed a complaint against defendants and others alleging that it was impossible for it to comply with the special education provisions of the Code and therefore the provisions were illegal. The trial court denied defendants' motion to strike and dismiss the complaint and, on appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the board had a duty pursuant to the Code to provide for special education and that such facilities had to be provided prior to making any claim for reimbursement from the state. The court further held, however, that the question of illegality of the special education provisions of the Code was not justiciable. The court explained that the action was not capable of being settled by the court because any dilemma in the statute had to be resolved by the legislature since the question of the efficiency and fairness of the school system was solely for the legislature to answer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged an order of the Circuit Court, Macon County (Illinois) denying their motion seeking reconsideration of the trial court's judgment granting a motion to dismiss filed by defendants, a hospital, a doctor, and a surgeon. Also denied was plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The motions to dismiss cited plaintiffs' violation of the Civil Practice Act &sect; 34, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 34 (1976 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 34 stated that in a complaint seeking money damages for personal injuries, no ad damnum was to be pleaded except to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the circuit rules of assignment where the claim was filed. It further stated that if an ad damnum in excess of that amount was pleaded, the complaint had to be dismissed without prejudice upon motion of a defendant or upon the court's own motion. In plaintiffs' medical malpractice complaint all defendants were charged with professional negligence and the counts contained ad damnum provisions ranging from $ 500,000 to $ 2,000,000. Reversing and remanding, the court held that under ordinary circumstances, requiring offending complainants to go to the further time and expense of filing a new lawsuit might have been an appropriate sanction. Under the situation in plaintiffs' case, the sanction imposed could well deny plaintiffs their day in court. The court found that this would impose too great a penalty. Accordingly, the court found that the trial court's denial of leave to file an amended complaint was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions that plaintiffs were allowed to file an amended complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving westerly on a two-lane road. Repair work was being done on the southerly lane. Three warning signs had been posted for westbound traffic approximately 1200-1500 feet from the work area. As defendant approached the work area a &quot;slow&quot; sign was displayed by a maintenance man at the east end of the work area. She proceeded in the northerly lane, a 25,000-pound endloader backed into the northerly lane, and defendant ran into it. She was injured. On appeal of her conviction, defendant alleged that she was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 551 (1975), which required her to appear because she was injured, was unconstitutional, and that the complaint failed to charge the crime as defined by statute. In affirming the judgment, the court ruled that the trial court was justified in finding that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of driving too fast for the conditions. Defendant failed to raise the other arguments in the trial court. The court, however, ruled that there was no equal protection violation. Because the complaint apprised defendant of the precise offense against her, it was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The minor was represented by counsel who informed the trial court that he had discussions with the State and his client, with the result that the latter wished to make an admission. Because the minor sought to make an admission only after a discussion with his counsel and because he exhibited an understanding of the thorough admonishment by the court of his rights and the consequences of a waiver of them, the court found that the proceedings comported with due process. The court found that viewing the explicit adjudication of wardship as procedural would effectuate this purpose of assuring that the minor be found either delinquent, otherwise in need of supervision, neglected, or dependent prior to the time that the best interests of the minor and the public were considered in adjudicating wardship, and would allow any aggrieved party to challenge its omission by a timely objection in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the employee petitioned the trial court for a writ to review and reverse the commission's action, but that petition was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court order that denied his petition. Notably, the court held that the employee had waived his right to certain notice requirements because he fully participated in the hearing before the commission and he failed to raise any objection as to the notice or timing requirements for the discharge hearing. Since the employee had failed to object to the alleged procedural deficiencies, the commission therefore retained jurisdiction over the discharge proceedings, and was empowered to terminate his employment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the orders of the Circuit Court of Franklin County (Illinois) that denied their motions for new trial and to withdraw plea of guilty to burglary charges after their pleas were entered and an adversarial sentencing hearing was held. Defendants had become aware that the clerk of the court had erroneously filed notices of appeal in their cases just prior to filing the postjudgment motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant was sentenced to two to six years, consecutive to several prior sentences, and the other to a term of one to three years. On appeal, defendants argued that their convictions should be reversed because at the time that they were charged with the felony of burglary, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 111--2(a) (1975) required such charges be by means of an indictment and they were charged by an information, and the subsequent amendment and retroactive application of &sect; 111--2(a) to allow prosecutions to be initiated by informations or indictments was unconstitutional. Finding the State correct in its contention that defendants waived the issue concerning the constitutionality by voluntarily pleading guilty, the court held that the plea proceedings were statutorily compliant and that defendants failed to prove their claim that the pleas were entered improvidently, and were neither intelligently nor voluntarily made. By the pleas, defendants waived all prior issues, including the non-jurisdictional one of the charging instrument. Finally, the trial court did not err in imposing the consecutive sentence as the crime was serious and the public was entitled to protection.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the Department's motion to dismiss because the truck stop failed to post a bond in the amount of the assessment or to petition the trial court for a lien in lieu of bond within 20 days of filing suit as required by &sect; 12 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 451 (1975). In addition, the trial court entered judgment in the Department's favor for $ 842,495.73, the final assessment plus further interest. On appeal, the truck stop argued that &sect; 12 was unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, violated due process requirements. The Department urged that because the court lacked jurisdiction to hear it, the truck stop's appeal required dismissal. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The truck stop's failure to post bond or to petition the trial court for a lien in lieu of bond within 20 days did not eliminate the truck stop's right to appellate review. Section 12 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act was neither unconstitutionally vague, nor violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested, tried, and convicted of the shooting death of an individual and aggravated battery of two other victims. After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the trial court ordered an examination as to defendant's fitness for sentencing. A defense physician concluded that defendant was not fit for sentencing and was similarly unfit at trial. A State physician gave an opposing opinion. Both opinions were presented at a hearing on defendant's fitness. At the hearing, the trial court allocated the burden of proving unfitness on defendant, pursuant to the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections &sect; 5-2-1(i), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-1(i) (1973). The trial court found defendant to be fit and sentenced him accordingly. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-1(i) (1973) was unconstitutional insofar as it placed the ultimate burden of proving unfitness on defendant. The court concluded that defendant's failure to attack the allocation of the burden of proof did not waive defendant's ability to argue unconstitutionality on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, injured child (child), appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found in favor of defendant day care center in the child's negligence action. The child argued that the day care center was not a school within School Code &sect; 24-24, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-24 (1975), so that the day care center was not immune from liability for its negligence that resulted in the child's injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was a paid pupil attending the day care center when she was injured. The day care center was licensed under &sect; 2.09 of the Child Care Act of 1969, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 2214 (1975). The child filed an action against the day care center, and the trial court granted the day care center's motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the child's motion for reconsideration, and the child appealed. The court reversed, holding that, as a matter of law, whether or not the day care center could be considered a &quot;school&quot; at common law, it was not a school under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-24, so it did not enjoy the protection extended to schools under para. 24-24. Paragraph 24-24 did not create an immunity from negligence for day care centers and nursery schools not run by a school system. Accordingly, summary judgment to the day care center was erroneous. The day care center may or may not have had stated educational purposes, but merely calling it a &quot;school&quot; and calling the child a &quot;student&quot; did not make either one. The day care center did not merit summary judgment because it did not meet its burden of proof that it was entitled to immunity as a &quot;school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the child's action for damages due to the day care center's negligence, the court reversed and remanded the award of summary judgment to the day care center.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he was denied due process by the trial court's failure to conduct a hearing on his fitness to stand trial, that certain comments by the trial judge and prosecutor deprived him of his right to a fair trial, and that the trial court imposed an excessive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on drug charges when an officer came to arrest him on a warrant charging other offenses and observed the drugs in plain view. Two years later, just prior to trial, defendant committed himself to a mental hospital. The trial court denied his attorney's motion for a continuance and issued a bench warrant for defendant. The next day the court heard testimony from defendant's treating psychologist. The court denied defendant's motion for hearing to determine his fitness to stand trial. Defendant's conduct during the trial was bizarre, but the trial court denied each renewal of the motion for hearing to determine fitness, stating that it believed defendant's antics were merely stalling tactics. The court held that the trial court was within its discretion in denying the motion. Only a qualified psychiatrist, not a psychologist, could give a professional opinion on defendant's fitness. The court held that the trial court's comment on defendant's stalling tactics did not deprive him of a fair trial. Nor did testimony that defendant was charged with other crimes when arrested or the prosecutor's remarks on that evidence in closing argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a general principle, a competent testator was allowed to dispose of his property as he saw fit and the justice or propriety of that disposition could not be considered by the courts. The purpose of Illinois' Probate Act was to permit an administration to get under way as quickly as was reasonably possible and yet to permit those who wished to question the will an adequate opportunity to test the validity of the will. However, because the probating of a will was a purely statutory proceeding and the Probate Act made no provision for a jury trial in an action to admit a will to probate, there was no error in denying petitioner's jury trial demand. The court further found that contrary to petitioner's contention, an attesting witness was permitted to testify that he believed the testator to be of sound mind and memory at the time of signing or acknowledging the will. There was no requirement that such a witness testify that he knew the testator was of sound mind and memory. In affirming, the court found no merit in either of petitioner's two remaining challenges, each of which concerned the propriety of the denial of certain of her discovery requests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the court-appointed counsel for an indigent acquitted of murder and conspiracy, sought review of a ruling of the chief judge of the 19th Judicial Circuit (Illinois), who pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 113-3(c) (1973) reduced his compensation for the protracted litigation. Counsel claimed that the reduction violated the Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his representation of the indigent, counsel participated in hearings combined with those of another defendant on motions to suppress evidence and statements, and obtained a vacation of judgment on a conspiracy charge in the other defendant's case. He spent 185 hours on the matter and sought payment for his time at a reduced rate, part of his office overhead, and payment for associates who attended the other trial. The chief judge eliminated the overhead and granted him fees at $ 20 per hour in-court and $ 10 per hour out-of-court. On review, the court found that the &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; provision of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 113-3(c) (1973), which raised the payment from $ 250, applied only in cases of protracted litigation, that the amount of time spent on a murder trial was not extraordinary, and that the Illinois legislature did not intend full compensation for counsel. The court rejected the Sixth Amendment and equal protection arguments because counsel was not totally uncompensated, and all lawyers were required to serve. The court allowed payment for the associates' time, noted a pending revision of the statutory minimum, and remanded for recalculation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment. The court remanded with directions for the chief judge to exercise discretion and compensate counsel for protracted litigation not to exceed $ 30 per hour in-court and $ 20 per hour out-of-court, noting that services performed by associates and paralegals were to be reviewed as to necessity and overall economy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer pulled over the car in which defendant was riding. After defendant exited the car, the officer saw the barrel of a gun under the driver's seat. Defendant was convicted of possession of the shotgun due to the presumption in &sect;24-1(c), in which the presence of a weapon in a car was evidence of possession by all occupants in the car. Defendant appealed his conviction, alleging that &sect; 24-1(c) was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of his case or, alternatively, that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court reversed. The court did not address the constitutionality of the statute because it determined that it should not so when other grounds existed upon which to base its decision. The court did find other grounds, determining that the state had not introduced any evidence to prove defendant's knowledge that the gun was in the car and had therefore failed to prove that defendant's possession of the gun was &quot;knowing,&quot; one of the essential elements of possession. The court held that where knowledge constituted an element of a criminal offense, proof of such should be based directly on established facts and not on an inference.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, as an unconstitutional prior restraint under U.S. Const. amend.

Counts II - IV asked that the court order defendants to refund excess service charges collected after Illinois Public Act 78-1255 took effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Public Act 78-1255 amended Ill. Rev.

The disputed amounts represented the percentage of taxes collected that the Director was allowed to retain to reimburse the costs of collecting the tax. The bill reduced the service charge from four percent to two percent. Plaintiffs argued that the amending bill &quot;passed&quot; when both houses of the General Assembly first passed it, and the effective date was December 5, 1974, when it became law by overriding the Governor's veto. The Director argued that the bill did not &quot;pass&quot; until both houses voted to override the veto after June 30, and thus the bill could not take effect until July 1 of the following year. The trial court declared that the effective date of the enactment was July 1, 1975, and dismissed plaintiffs' remaining counts for failure to state a cause of action. The court reversed, holding that the bill &quot;passed&quot; when both houses first passed it and sent it to the Governor.

There was no showing of a history of mental disorders or of recent psychiatric hospitalization at the trial which could raise a bona fide doubt of defendant's competence to stand trial. Therefore, defendant was competent to stand trial and his jury waiver was valid and his conviction for attempted murder was affirmed. The court vacated defendant's conviction for aggravated battery because his conviction arose from the same act as that for which he was convicted of attempted murder. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's amended post-conviction petition because the only new issue raised by defendant was whether he was denied due process of law when the trial court failed to sua sponte order an examination into his fitness to stand trial and said issue could have been reviewed in his direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was later arrested and indicted on pandering charges. The State then filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation. At the hearing, defendant brought a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the pandering statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-16 (1983), was unconstitutional because it created a gender-based classification, which violated equal protection. The court noted that the statute specifically prohibited compelling or arranging for a female to become a prostitute. The trial court refused to rule on the constitutionality of the statute, contending that it was not relevant to the probation revocation proceeding. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to address the issue, and that the order revoking his probation had to be reversed because it was predicated on conduct prohibited by an unconstitutional statute. The court held that defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the pandering statute because defendant did not fall within the statutory classification he sought to attack in that he was not a female.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his driver's license was revoked and was sentenced to seven days' incarceration. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the revocation of defendant's license was conducted pursuant to a valid statutory procedure. The court rejected defendant's claim that the procedure had been declared unconstitutional. The court vacated the sentence imposed by the trial court on the ground that the trial court erred when it refused to consider a probationary sentence and when it stated that it would never consider probation for a defendant who drove a motor vehicle after revocation of his driver's license. The court found that the legislature intended to permit the imposition of a probationary sentence for a violation of &sect; 6-303(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The court determined that probation was a proper sentencing alternative for violation of the statute. The court noted that no modification was made to &sect; 5 -5-3(d)(1) of the Unified Code of Corrections to limit the possibility of probation for driving a vehicle after a defendant's driver's license had been revoked.</SPAN></P>

After he dropped out of the program twice, defendant's probation was revoked and he was sentenced to a prison term on the original count. Defendant sought credit against his prison term for the time he spent on probation, which was denied. Defendant argued that he should be entitled to the credit under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4(h), but that the statute was unconstitutional. The State argued that defendant waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by failing to raise those arguments in the trial court. The court found, however, that the argument was such that it could not be raised until after a final ruling was made. The court found that the statute was sufficiently limited to constitute valid standards for its application. Defendant also argued that the denial of credit constituted a second punishment, violative of double jeopardy requirements. The court found that probation could not be equated with imprisonment for purposes of the prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed a claim for credit for the amount of the taxes it had overpaid since it had included the cigarette use tax in its gross receipts. Finding that the evidence did not show that the retailer had either borne the burden of the tax and not passed it on to the purchaser, or repaid unconditionally such amount to the purchaser as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 445 (1975), the Department denied the claim. The circuit court affirmed the Department's decision. The court determined that statute allowing recovery or credit for an overpayment of sales or use taxes only permitted such recovery where the taxpayer himself had borne the burden of the tax. The taxpayer testified that if he was given a credit, he would be receiving money from the Department which he did in fact collect from his customers and that he had not refunded the extra amount to any customer. Concluding that the Department's finding that the taxpayer had passed the tax on to his customers was not manifestly against the weight of the evidence, the court held that denial of the credit was thus proper.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that defendant's work truck was seen on several occasions delivering rock to the property and that the testimony established the existence of a contract between defendant and the landowner.

On appeal, the court determined that the statutory system for local option elections did not violate the home rule provisions of the Illinois Constitution. The argument was deficient because it gave the court no indication as to which ordinances were involved, and therefore consideration of the issue by the court was inappropriate. The statutory system was a valid delegation of legislative authority. The complaints failed to set forth sufficient grounds to contest the results of the elections. The differences in procedures for referendums in communities having populations in excess of 200,000 did not render the statute invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor was low bidder on the school plumbing job. The board refused to award the job to the contractor, however, because the contractor's affirmative action plan, details of which were required to be submitted with the bid, and which was a selection criteria, was deemed unacceptable. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the trial court erred in issuing the writ. The court explained that mandamus would lie to compel performance of a ministerial act if the relator proved that he had a clear legal right to its performance and proved that the board had a clear legal obligation or duty to perform the nondiscretionary act. The court noted that the obverse of this rule was that mandamus would not lie to compel the exercise of discretion or to compel the exercise of discretion in a particular manner. The court observed that it was for the board to decide if the affirmative action plan was acceptable, and the court declined to create a writ of mandamus to govern the exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict, that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void, that the ordinance was arbitrary and capricious, and that the assessment was unreasonable, capricious, and violative of his constitutional rights. The court agreed that the evidence established that the tavern was a licensed retail liquor establishment that was not closed 45 minutes after the required closing hour, that defendant and 19 patrons were present, and that some patrons were drinking. As a result, denial of the directed verdict was proper. The court also found that the ordinance was not vague, uncertain, or ambiguous. In addition, defendant had no standing to challenge the enforcement of the ordinance as arbitrary because he was arrested 30 minutes after a 15 minute grace period had ended.

On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the rezoning of the applicant's property was valid because it was in the public interest and did not impose a hardship on the surrounding properties. However, the court found that the applicant was not entitled to a writ of mandamus. The proposed retirement community was not a permitted use under the zoning ordinance because it was not a nonprofit home operated by an organization listed in the ordinance. Additionally, the restrictive covenant, which was placed on the property when it was rezoned, did not permit the construction of the retirement community because the provisions of the zoning ordinance were controlling.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying credit against his sentence for the time he was on probation. The court found that when defendant was originally sentenced, he was entitled to credit for his time served on probation against his sentence of imprisonment pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4(h) (1973). To deny him credit based on the amendment of the statute would constitute an unconstitutional application of an ex post facto law against him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners physically connected the sewer pipes on their property to those of the city. Pursuant to city ordinance, the city assessed the property owners with a connection fee. The property owners failed to pay the fee and the city brought an action to collect the fee. The circuit court found in favor of the property owners. The city sought review, contending that the property owners, having physically connected sewer pipes to the city's sewer lines could be forced to pay the connection fee of $ 17,500 required by a city ordinance. The ordinance was passed some eight months after the connections but prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for the property. On review, the court agreed. When the language of Ill. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-150-1 was construed in light of the general purposes or objectives of the statute, it became clear that the statute was not one authorizing physical connections, but one authorizing the collection of fees from those who have become users of sewer systems.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and was found to be a first time offender under the Act. Defendant sought review of the fact that the trial court imposed fines and court costs on him in addition to his probation. Defendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred in imposing costs and fines because they were not applicable to a proceeding when there has been neither a judgment of conviction or a determination of guilt. The court found defendant's argument to be without merit. The court held that defendant's argument that his plea of guilty was not a finding or determination of guilty was illogical. Although, pursuant to the Act, the trial court deferred entry of a judgment of conviction, that did not mean that the trial court had not made a determination of guilt.

Defendant did not present the errors at trial or in his written post-trial motion. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the friend's testimony did not result in prejudicial error because there was ample competent evidence to sustain a conviction. The State's elicitation regarding the gun used in the prior robbery did not amount to plain error, the standard required because defendant did not object at trial. The sentencing statute, Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ill. Rev.

Plaintiffs also wanted a writ of mandamus to issue to command the Regional Superintendent to hold the election. Plaintiffs appealed after the circuit court dismissed the petitions. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the State Superintendent was delegated the requisite power and duty to approve or disapprove the organization of a community unit school district pursuant to para. 11-6(e)(1), and had jurisdiction to deny the petition. The court then held that a writ of certiorari was not available permit judicial review because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 11-6(e)(1973) prohibited judicial review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was apprehended inside a music store. A door leading into the store was broken into, and blood was found on it. Defendant had a cut on his hand that was bleeding at the time of the arrest. At his trial for burglary, defendant sought to invoke the defense of intoxication. At the close of the evidence, defendant offered instructions on criminal damage to property, which was not a lesser-included crime, and the lower court refused to give them. On appeal, the court dismissed defendant's appeal. The court found that defendant waived his contentions of error by his failure to file any post-trial motions as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 116-1 (1975). Furthermore, defendant failed to inform the lower court of any alleged error so as to give it the opportunity to correct the error. Such failure may also have been, in fact, an acquiescence in the error alleged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency denied a permit to the coal company on its application for a certain mine. The Agency reasoned that the Environmental Protection Act prohibited the Agency from issuing a permit for any facility that would threaten, cause, or allow the discharge of contaminants that might cause or tend to cause water pollution. The coal company filed a pleading before the Board, seeking administrative review of the denial of its permit application. The Board dismissed all counts of the pleading without a hearing. The coal company appealed, contending that it was constitutionally deprived of its property without due process of law. The court affirmed, holding that the coal company was not denied an opportunity for a hearing before final administrative refusal of the permit because upon the dismissal of three of the four counts in the coal company's pleading, the coal company was entitled to file amended or new pleadings. The court concluded that the fourth count of the pleading was properly dismissed because the Board was without jurisdiction over the coal company's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Illinois) that dismissed his complaint against defendant inspector with prejudice. Plaintiff's complaint alleged that the inspector was employed with a state agency and, in excess of his duties, he negligently or wilfully and wantonly initiated criminal charges against plaintiff and publicly accused plaintiff of being an adulterator and mishandler of feed products.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that plaintiff's suit should have been filed in the Court of Claims because the action was a suit against an individual for governmental acts. On appeal, the court considered the question of whether plaintiff was, in fact, suing the State of Illinois in contravention of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 801 (1975). The court emphasized that in considering the case it was not concerned with the question of whether plaintiff's complaint stated a cause of action against the inspector individually. Reversing, the court determined that plaintiff did not purport to sue the State or a department of the State. Because plaintiff requested damages only against the inspector personally, and because he did not attempt to control the action of the State or subject it to liability, the court held that the cause of action was not one against the State of Illinois.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property, land and a two-story commercial building, was the sole asset of a real estate corporation. The area surrounding the building declined and the corporation was not able to find tenants. For the years in question, the taxpayer paid the first installment of the first year, the first installment of the second year, and no further taxes until the filing of the action. Finally, the taxpayer was able to sell the property and, as part of the contract, the sale proceeds were to be applied to redemption of unpaid real estate taxes. The taxes were paid in full. Accompanying the redemption was a real estate protest letter. The taxpayer had appeared before the assessor and board of tax appeals to contest the valuation of the property for only one of the years in question. The taxpayer argued that it was precluded from its statutory remedy because of its inability to pay and that the statutory remedy as applied to them was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The court noted that the taxpayer did not contest the assessments prior to judgments being entered in favor of the State, that it voluntarily paid the taxes, and that the payment was not made under protest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim honked his horn when a car pulled in front of his truck. Later, he saw the same car beside his truck.

On appeal from defendant's conviction for battery and for aggravated battery, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 12-3, 12-4(b)(8) (1975), the court held that: (1) defendant was liable as a principal to battery because he aided and abetted in the crime by countenancing and by approving the acts of his co-defendant; (2) he failed to show a particular need or prejudice in the denial of his untimely motion for continuance, which sought to secure private counsel, as he was already represented by a public defender; and (3) battery was a lesser-included offense of aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were accused of various crimes and were each found unlikely to become fit to stand trial in the foreseeable future. The State sought a dismissal of the appeal on the grounds that the petitions were in fact motions to dismiss indictments and that the trial court's denial of such motions was not appealable. Petitioners argued that habeas corpus was the only means for challenging what they asserted was a denial of equal protection in the manner in which the State applied &sect; 5-2-2 (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-2 (1975)) of the Unified Code of Corrections. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying relief and remanding the cause. First, the court found that the proceedings were proper habeas corpus matters and thus denied the State's motion to dismiss. Noting that &sect; 5-2-2 required courts to determine whether an unfit person charged with a crime required mental treatment and to either release such person or to begin civil commitment proceedings, the court found that the statute was constitutional and found no evidence in the record as to whether petitioners had, as asserted, been discriminated against because of the criminal court's jurisdiction over them.</SPAN></P>

The tax collector brought an action to amend or modify the injunction, and the circuit court vacated and dissolved the permanent injunction. The court reversed and held that the law existing at the time a contract was made became a part of it. Furthermore, the court ruled that a constitutional provision denying the power to pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract had reference only to a statute enacted after the making of a contract.

The trial court excluded the recordings because they were of poor quality and also because they were found to violate the Fourth Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court ruled that the order excluding evidence was appealable where it was based in part on a determination that the interception was unconstitutional. In reversing the order, the court held that the trial judge erred in determining that the interceptions violated the federal and state constitutions because it was not unconstitutional to record a conversation with the consent of only one participant. The court emphasized that in ruling that the interceptions were not unconstitutionally obtained it was not deciding that they were admissible at trial and that its decision was without prejudice to either party on the issue of admissibility.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and the court held that it was clear that the trial court had jurisdiction over defendant and the subject matter. In conformance with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-2(a), it properly found that the defendant was not fit to stand trial and ordered that he be remanded to the Department. The fact that two paragraphs of the order were drafted to conform to a prior law and that certain blanks were not completed did not void the entire order. Additionally, the fact that defendant was in the county jail for 24 days, when he properly should have been admitted to a hospital, did not entitle him to release. The court concluded that the record and the applicable law amply supported the trial court's ruling.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 46 of the Revenue Act allowed defendants, in any year, to revise and correct an assessment. The court further held that the taxpayers' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action was properly dismissed.

The court found that defendant exhibited no reluctance to transact the illegal sale. When viewed in the light of defendant's eventual procurement of the requested drugs, the court determined that the trial court and jury could have properly concluded that defendant's initial expressions of reluctance were not convincing. As to arguments relating to an accomplice, the court found that while he may have acted to solicit, aid, and abet defendant in the commission of the offense, his association with authorities clearly prevented the successful commission of the offense without detection and relieved him of accountability for the offense. The trial court, therefore, did not err in refusing an accomplice testimony instruction. The court also found no basis in the record for the conclusion that the classification of cocaine in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act was unreasonable and unconstitutional, or violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The landowner removed some trees and moved some dirt around, but did not begin actual building construction prior to the expiration of the building permit. The court reversed the trial court's decision, finding that the landowner failed to prove a legal right to a writ of mandamus because the landowner did not timely begin construction as required by the municipal building code. The court rejected the landowner's contention, which had been erroneously adopted by the trial court, that the expenses incurred and the preliminary excavation work created a vested right to complete a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

The other license holders were individual retail liquor licensees who had traded small quantities of alcoholic beverages with other retail licensees, which were repaid in kind. The Commission found that the subject acts of defendants violated Ill. Liq. Cont. Com. R. 25 (1963) and suspended their licenses. The circuit court affirmed the Commission's decision. The court held that Rule 25 clarified which transfers violated Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 115(d) (1973) and that the Commission's interpretation of the statute it was created to enforce was entitled to great weight. The court also concluded that Ill. Liq. Cont. Com. R. 25 (1963) was reasonably related to the health, safety, or welfare of Illinois citizens and was consistent with the legislative purpose of close control of alcoholic liquors mandated by the Liquor Control Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question on appeal was whether the nonvoting student member of the community college board had the right to attend executive sessions. The court held that he did. The court did not find that the Meeting of Public Agencies Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 102, para. 42 (1973), was either vague or ambiguous, nor did it deem it necessary to seek out extrinsic questions in an attempt to find the statute unconstitutional. Further, the court did not believe that the constitution required the legislature to spell out all of the minute details in relation to the election of the student member, and it found that the provision contained sufficient standards and guidelines. The court pointed out that to hold that the student member could not attend executive sessions would place him in little better position than any student who might have wished to attend the board meetings. The court noted that the purpose of placing the student member on the board was to afford the student body representation in that body, not only in public meetings but in closed sessions as well.

The court found that there was no real conflict of interest and therefore defendants were not denied effective assistance of counsel in that they were represented by one attorney because each defendant, except one, presented an alibi defense, which were in no way conflicting, and, in fact, complimented and corroborated those of the others. The court also found that the sentence of one defendant had to be modified because &sect; 5-8-4 of the Unified Code of Corrections had not been amended to allow concurrent sentences until the middle of defendant's case, and therefore defendant was entitled to sentencing in accordance with the act most favorable to him, which was consecutive sentences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department filed a petition to take the landowners' land for the purpose of constructing a bridge. The landowners filed a cross-petition alleging certain land would be damaged as a result of the taking and requested damages to compensate their expected loss. In January of 1972 the department deposited the amount determined for preliminary just compensation with the county treasurer, and the trial court entered an order vesting title to the property in the state. The landowners did not appeal from that order. However, after numerous continuances of the final just compensation hearing, the trial court granted the landowners' motion to dismiss the department's petition and returned the deposited funds to the department over three years later. The department appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the department's petition. The court held that it was an abuse of power for the department to &quot;quick take&quot; property under the pretense of imminent necessity when there existed only some possibility of need at an indefinite future date. Thus, the trial court possessed the inherent power to correct such an abuse.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed on appeal that he did not waive his right to a jury trial, that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, and that his sentence was unconstitutional because his conduct was caused by his psychological drive for compulsive exhibitionism. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court found that the circuit court's inquiry into whether he understood the consequences of waiving the jury was sufficient and that defendant waived the jury issue on appeal because it was not raised in a post-trial motion for a new trial. The court also found that the evidence adequately supported the conviction and that there was no evidence that defendant's volition was overcome so as to render his actions completely beyond his control or that the sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11--503 (1975) and was therefore unconstitutional.

Before the start of the bench trial the village attorney amended the complaint on its face to charge a violation of the reckless driving ordinance of the village. During the proceedings the trial judge on his own motion dismissed the complaint. The court reversed and remanded. The court held as follows: (1) the legislature did not express the intention to preempt municipalities from regulating motor traffic and municipalities were empowered to pass traffic laws not in conflict with state law; (2) the reckless driving ordinance of the village was authorized by state statute, was not in conflict with the state statute, and was constitutional; and (3) the fact that the village ordinance and the state statute provided for differing punishments for the commission of the offense did not create a conflict between the ordinance and the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed from the decision contending that he had been denied a fair trial when the lower court ruled that two witnesses could not be allowed to testify concerning statements that defendant had made previous to the murder. The lower court ruled the statements as inadmissible hearsay. On appeal, the court found that defendant's entire defense concerned his insanity at the time of the crime and the theory presented by the defense was that defendant demonstrated marked irrational behavior before the murder. Therefore, the court found that the statements were not hearsay and were relevant to the issue of defendant's mental state. The court also found that the introduction of a gruesome, color photograph of the deceased's massive head wound was prejudicial. The court found that the photograph that was admitted did not serve any purpose other than to inflame and prejudice the jury. In view of the defendant's admission of the offense of murder and his defense of insanity, the photograph was not probative of any material issue in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facility where the applicant lived refused to promise to accept payment from the Department as payment in full for the applicant's support, as required by a Department regulation prohibiting supplementation of public assistance; for that reason, the Department denied aid. The applicant argued that the regulation was contrary to the Illinois Public Aid Code and denied him equal protection. In affirming the trial court's reversal of the Department's decision, the court held that under &sect; 11-13 of the Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 11-13, the Department was not authorized to deny the applicant aid. The regulation at issue served to divide the family unit in violation of the Code's provision that all policy decisions should strengthen the family unit. The legislature intended to allow parents of recipients to supplement public aid. Therefore, the challenged regulation was null and void. In addition, the regulation denied the applicant equal protection, as no reasonable basis existed for prohibiting the applicant from utilizing supplementation while allowing other public aid recipients to receive supplementation from the Illinois Department of Mental Health.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the disorderly conduct statute did not violate the procedural due process requirements under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 because it defined the prohibited conduct in sufficiently precise terms. The court further concluded that the resisting arrest ordinance's proscription against only a physical act that could have impeded, hindered, interrupted, prevented, or delayed an arrest that was made by a police officer or at his direction was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also opined that, because defendant's own testimony conclusively established conclusively that she knowingly and wilfully resisted the efforts to arrest her, any omission in the instructions as to that offense's elements was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

On the State's motion, the trial court ordered that his gun be forfeited pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-6 (1973). On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that it would concern itself only with the statute in effect at the time of the seizure, that due process was not an issue because defendant was not aggrieved by the failure to provide for prior notice and an opportunity to be heard under para. 24-6, and that no one could assert a legal ownership or right to possession in a contraband weapon. The court reasoned that while Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), which sentenced him to three to 20 years in prison with no creditor for time served on probation after revoking his probation. Defendant was initially convicted of burglary on his plea of guilty and sentenced to two years of probation, and he claimed that the sentence should be set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge who imposed the revocation sentence considered the original presentence report, and neither defendant nor his counsel objected to the original judge's failure to impose sentence. Defendant had no prior felony convictions, but he had previously served time on juvenile probation and time in jail on violating that probation. Also, he had been convicted of disorderly conduct and battery, and he had received an undesirable discharge from military service. Defendant claimed that different judges presided at his two sentencing hearings, that the revocation sentence exceeded the statutory minimum when combined with the time served on probation, and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005 - 6 - 4(h) was unconstitutional. The court found that defendant waived any error as to the different judges, and it found that the rule requiring a credit for jail time served did not apply to probation time because the deprivation of liberty involved in probation was so much less than that involved in imprisonment. The court found the sentence excessive and ruled to reduce it with credit for the time served on probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reduced the revocation sentence to a term of one to 10 years with credit for the time spent on probation and remanded the case for issuance of amended mittimus to reflect the reduced sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the provision of the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional, and that the form of his sentence was erroneous. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, declining to consider defendant's assignment of error pertaining to his constitutional challenge regarding presumptions because no issues were raised as to concealment in defendant's case. The court concluded that defendant's constitutional challenge as to retail theft was without merit because the retail mercantile establishment classification was not impermissible. The court found nothing improper in providing a special theft statute applicable to offenses of a special nature. The court modified defendant's sentence, holding that the language of the trial court's sentence was too vague but, also that an amendment was sufficient to cure an error. The court amended the sentence and affirmed as amended.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 8-11-2 (1973), and the school district's action for a declaration that the tax was unconstitutional as applied to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district contended that it had standing to challenge the tax. The school district also contended that the tax was invalid because it was an attempt to tax beyond the municipality's territorial limits, and it taxed state funds. The court affirmed the judgments. The court noted that the utilities directly affected as the initial taxpayers could be said to have no real interest in the controversy since the charge for the tax was added to their users' bills, and held that the school district had standing. The court concluded that the tax imposed by the city was constitutional. The court stated that as the tax was levied upon the utilities and not on the school district, the school district's contention that state funds were being taxed was without merit. The court determined that the school district's contention that the ordinance had an unauthorized extraterritorial effect was likewise without merit. The court pointed out that the ordinance merely taxed the utilities' business in the city, and found that the enabling statute and the municipal ordinance were constitutional as applied to the school district.</SPAN></P>

Noise Regulations (Regulations) and &sect; 24, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1024 (1973), of the Environmental Protection Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1001 et seq.

Pursuant to administrative proceedings the parties entered into an agreement whereby the stipulated testimony of citizen witnesses regarding the noise levels beyond the utility's property boundaries was introduced for the Board's consideration. The Board found that character and degree of interference with the enjoyment of life and lawful activity occasioned by sounds emanating from the utility's pumping operations to be &quot;unreasonable.&quot; The court held that: (1) Rule 102, as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court, simply prohibited emissions that unreasonably interfered with life or activities; (2) the Act did not preclude the prosecution of noise pollution under Rule 102; (3) sufficient evidence was adduced at the hearing as to each enumerated factor to support the Board's ruling; (4) the Act contained sufficient standards to have accorded the utility due process of law; and (5) the Board had exceeded its authority in imposing the civil penalty.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that, in light of his self-defense argument, the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the State presented substantial evidence that when defendant struck him in the head, the victim was walking away from defendant. Defendant also testified that he had drawn the gun at a time when the victim was not threatening him. Defendant's belief that he was about to receive great bodily harm from a person trained in karate was not reasonable under the circumstances. In the absence of error upon which to predicate the exercise of Rule 615(b)(3) power, the court was required to affirm where the trier of fact was justified in concluding that defendant was guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.

No constitutional problem arose because the statutory scheme permitted a prosecutor to charge armed violence on facts identical to those constituting aggravated battery, as the legislature was entitled to grant the prosecutor the power to select from a range of penalties. The court found that the evidence of defendant's past use of illicit drugs was properly admitted at trial because it served the ends of justice.

There was evidence that the hallway was sufficiently blocked that normal movement was not possible and that defendant and the other students were given notice to leave and were repeatedly asked to leave without being arrested. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the statute proscribed only conduct that wilfully impeded free movement of other persons, or that interfered with or disrupted normal activities of the institution. There was no restriction on the content of the speech, only conduct was proscribed. Furthermore, the elements of wilful and knowing conduct were clearly shown because warnings of the violation were repeated over a period of more than two hours. The court held that the statute was constitutionally designed to further a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, husband of a hospital patient, sought review of a judgment against him entered by the Circuit Court of Coles County (Illinois) in an action brought by plaintiff Department of Mental Health to recover charges for treatment furnished to the patient. The Department assessed these charges against the husband as a &quot;responsible relative&quot; pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, &sect; 12-12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the parties were legally married, they lived separate and apart for a number of years. During the separation the wife was institutionalized in several state mental institutions and incurred the charges in question. The husband asserted that he and his wife had been separated for more than 10 years, that the wife willfully failed to support or contribute to their marriage, and that &sect; 12-12 was unconstitutional. He also argued that the Department failed to adequately prove that his wife or her estate was unable to pay the charges for his wife's treatment. The court, however, found that the husband's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies by not seeking a redetermination of the charges waived the issue. In addition, the court found that the husband was a responsible relative within the meaning of &sect; 12-12. The retention of the marital status imposed the liability on the husband and the parties' separation or the Department's failure to show lack of justification for the separation did not relieve the husband of liability. Finally, the husband could not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 12-12 because he failed to support his claim that he was an affected party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents to pay for funds that were allegedly withheld from the district to cover the cost of assessment, extension, and collection of the district's taxes by the county. The lower court issued the writ, and respondents appealed. The court reversed and remanded because the trial court's summary disposition of this case was improper. Specifically, at the close of the district's case the trial court granted its motion for issuance of a writ of mandamus, thereby depriving respondents of an opportunity to establish facts that may have directly affected the district's right to relief. Respondents sought to prove that the district received the full amount of the tax levy it requested and that the sums withheld represented an increased tax charged to the taxpayers as a means of offsetting expenses. This evidence was relevant to the district's right to recovery because it extended to the district's standing to sue. Therefore, the court was unable to say that the proof offered by the district foreclosed all factual issues or negated all possible theories of defense.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the constitutionality of &sect; 192-8 and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court found that &sect; 192-8 did not infringe upon defendants' liberty interests because it reflected the values of the community, it was based on a proper purpose, i.e., protecting the morals of the community, and it was reasonably drawn to effectuate that purpose. Further, the court found that cross-dressing was not a protected form of expression under U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV. The court also found that &sect; 192-8 was not vague or overbroad because a person of common intelligence and experience could easily ascertain the conduct that was prohibited thereunder.

The court also held that the Criminal Code of 1961 was not preemptive of the city's right to regulate the business of massage. Further, it was not unreasonable for the city to require of one proposing to sell massage services to the public that such person demonstrate evidence of training and knowledge in the field.

The trial court denied relief, and petitioner appealed the decision. The court noted that the issue presented was whether petitioner may have sought the relief provided by the Habeas Corpus Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 65, para. 1 et seq. (1975), after he had been paroled. The court noted that admission of a prisoner to parole did not entitled that prisoner to discharge, rather he remained in the custody of the department of corrections at all times. In addition, parole was conditional upon the continuing compliance of the prisoner with the law. Failure to comply resulted in revocation of parole. Therefore, the court concluded that such conditions placed petitioner within the category of persons who were restrained of their liberty and who were entitled to discharge by a subsequent intervening act. The court held that petitioner may have maintained a habeas corpus action even though he was granted parole, and the judgment of the trial court was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 24, par. 11-80-8(1971), and violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 and art. VIII. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city acquired from the corporation land located within another city, and a water tower located thereon. The company argued that the city allowed the corporation's logo to remain on the water tower, providing the corporation an unfair commercial advantage. The court held that the city was entitled to lease the use of its property but only if doing so subserved the public interest. Incidental benefits to private entities did not violate Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(a), requiring that public property only be used for public purpose. The court found that the corporation's logo on the water tower was purely for private gain. An injunction prohibiting the improper use of the public property was a proper remedy. Damages was disallowed. No claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage existed because there was no evidence that the city knew of the company's business expectancies. The city's breach of its duty did not allow for an individual's claim of negligence. The city was immune from damages under the Local Government and Government Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev.

Defendant and some of his friends had been standing outside of the restaurant and followed the victim and the widow home. As they entered their building, two men ran across the street toward them. One man seized the victim, and the other man shot him to death. During the attack, a scarf that concealed one man's face slipped down. The widow identified the man as defendant. She knew defendant for a period of five months, and she had seen him in the restaurant as often as three times a day. Defendant was convicted of murder. He appealed, but the appeal was dismissed after he failed to pursue. Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that any error by the prosecution in not disclosing statements made by defendant's alibi witnesses was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a guardian of the estate of two wards whose plaintiff mother was allegedly subjected to sexual discrimination, appealed a decision by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed her second amended complaint. The mother originally sought a declaration that &sect; 17-122 of the Illinois Pension Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 17-122 (1973), was unconstitutional as in violation of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provision of the Illinois Pension Code in issue provided for pensions upon the death of male teachers. The mother was a public school teacher, and the guardian sued for damages incurred by the allegedly sexually discriminatory acts taken by defendants, a city board of education and others, resulting in the failure to pay to survivors of female public school teachers the benefits equal to those received by survivors of male teachers. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. When the guardian brought the case as guardian of the estate of children of a female public school teacher, she did not allege that &sect; 17-22 of the Illinois Pension Code discriminated against children of female teachers. The alleged acts of discrimination were aimed at a third party and not at the guardian's wards. Therefore, the guardian had no standing to assert the rights of the mother, a third party, as to an alleged sexually discriminatory act. The question of whether female teachers were barred from contributing to the pension fund presented a substantive question that the court could not address because of the guardian's lack of standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal included whether the temporary restraining order was entered in violation of law and if the contempt orders entered pursuant to it were a nullity, whether the order extending the temporary restraining order (TRO) was invalid and void, and whether the trial court abused its discretion by issuing the preliminary injunction. The court reversed the TRO, dismissed the appeal of the preliminary injunction as moot, and affirmed the remainder of the orders. The court found that the lower court judge and the board knew that the union counsel was on his way to the hearing but entered the TRO without waiting for him, thus creating an ex parte order that failed to comply with the applicable statute because it did not state why it was granted without notice. The court determined that the lower court committed error by entering such a TRO and also committed error by extending it after it had expired, and failing to set a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction prior to the extension. The court concluded, however, that the errors did not void either the TRO or its extension, nor did they invalidate the contempt proceedings based on those orders.</SPAN></P>

The punishment was not so wholly disproportionate to the offense committed that it would have shocked the moral sense of the community.

The court affirmed the prior denial of the employee's request for a recalculation of his benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possession of motor vehicle component parts with knowledge that the identification numbers were removed in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, par. 4--103(d) (1973). The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that he had waived certain evidentiary objections by not having preserved them at trial. Further, the court rejected defendant's assertion that par. 4--103(d), was unconstitutionally vague under the Fourteenth Amendment, noting that the term &quot;identification number&quot; was clearly defined. Although defendant asserted that par. 4--103(d), violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, the court found that the state's interest in protecting against theft outweighed the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, par. 4--103(d) (1973), violated his Equal Protection rights under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and the Fourteenth Amendment. Equal protection applied only to interference with an existing right and that no constitutional right permitted the violation of a penal statute that was non-discriminatory on its face.</SPAN></P>

When a tenant walked into the building, the officer attempted to arrest him because he received information that the tenant was responsible for three recent burglaries in the building. At the end of the interaction, the tenant received 29 stitches behind his left ear. The officer was charged with violating various rules of the police department and was ultimately discharged. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The court found that all three findings of the board ignored the salient detail of the incident, which was that the officer was attempting to arrest the tenant for burglary. The court stated that it was not a private dispute in which the officer resorted to self-help, and the characterization of the incident as an &quot;argument and altercation&quot; was manifestly incorrect. The court held that the findings of fact of the board were against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed the administrator's motion to strike the affirmative defense of the pilot that the action was barred by the statute of limitation in wrongful death actions and the affirmative defense of the pilot and the aircraft owner that decedent's were guests and could not recover under the Illinois guest act, Ill.

The trial court, after a hearing, revoked defendant's probation and sentenced him. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to substitute the trial court judge and in denying his motion to dismiss the probation revocation petition due to a three-year delay in charging the commission of an escape as a basis for revocation. Defendant also argued that it was error to admit into evidence a transcript of a deposition of the sheriff from whose jail defendant had escaped. The court noted that there was no mandatory rule that a judge who presided over defendant's revocation proceeding had to a different judge than the one who granted probation. Further, the court found that the three-year delay in charging defendant with the offense that triggered the probation revocation did not prejudice defendant. Finally, the court determined that the probation revocation could not stand because it was based on admission of a deposition transcript, which was not authorized by Ill. Rev.

The parolees were incarcerated for parole violations pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. 38, para. 1003-1-1 et seq.

They were incarcerated after hearings before the Board and their requests for bond on the parole violation warrants were denied. On appeal, they argued that because probationers were afforded the right to bail pending final resolution of their cases, parolees should be provided the same opportunity pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The State contended that there was a rational basis for the distinction predicated upon an &quot;inherent difference&quot; between a probationer and a parolee. The court, however, ruled that the conditional liberty granted to parolees was protectible as a fundamental interest. Applying the compelling interest standard, the trial courts were required to make bail available to parolees because probationers were so privileged. Nonetheless, the court declined to compel the Board to admit the parolees to bail because mandamus was not the proper form of relief. Even assuming that the Board had a duty to grant bail in proper cases, mandamus would not compel the exercise of a discretionary power in a particular manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cab company appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), in favor of plaintiff owner. The owner brought a negligence action seeking damages done to the owner's vehicle. It was alleged that an employee of the cab company negligently left the ignition key in a taxicab with the motor running in violation of &sect; 92 of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 189 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxi cab company contended on appeal that &sect; 92 was unconstitutionally vague because the word &quot;unattended&quot; used therein lacked sufficient definiteness to give adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The court noted that an owner or driver of a vehicle may avoid violating the statute by simply turning off the motor and removing the ignition key. However, if he chose to leave the key in the ignition he must be sure that the vehicle was left attended. Taking the common dictionary meaning of the term &quot;unattended&quot; in light of the statute's purpose, the court held that &sect; 92 required the owner or driver of a vehicle who left the keys in the ignition to ensure that it was guarded or watched over in such a manner so as to avoid the vehicle being set in motion. The court held that its interpretation of &sect; 92 required an owner or driver to leave such a vehicle with a trusted person who was responsible for watching over that vehicle and was capable of controlling the vehicle with immediate access to the controls should the vehicle be suddenly set in motion while the motor was running.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, class of distributors and class of sellers, appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted the petitions of the defendant director of revenue and intervenor consumer class to compel the deposit of monies in the protest fund in the action to declare the Illinois Tobacco Products Tax Act unconstitutional. The class of distributors and class of sellers appealed the denial of their motions to quash.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Illinois Tobacco Products Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, pars. 453.81 to 453.91 (1969), was unconstitutional and entered an order requiring that taxes collected pursuant to Ch. 120, pars. 452.81 to 453.91 be deposited into a protest fund during the pendency of the appeal. The director of revenue and the consumer class filed petitions to compel the deposit of monies collected into the fund. Members of the class of sellers and class of distributors filed motions to quash. The trial court denied the motions to quash and granted the petitions. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. Members of the class of sellers and class of distributors who refused to pay the tax after the ruling of unconstitutionality did not destroy the classes. The fact that the members of the class of distributors and class of sellers had different claim amounts did not defeat the class status because the requirements of a class action were met. The trial court had the authority to compel the deposit of funds into the protest fund pursuant to the &quot;further relief&quot; provision of &sect; 57.1(3) of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, par. 57.1(3) (1973).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that granted the petitions of the director of revenue and the class of consumers to compel the deposit of monies collected under the Illinois Tobacco Products Tax Act into the protest fund. The court affirmed the order denying the motions to quash of the members of the distributor class and seller class. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

They found defendant in an apparent drunken state and arrested him. The court reversed the judgment suppressing the evidence and held as follows: (1) the observation of defendant's manner of driving provided the arresting officer with reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was committing the offense of driving while intoxicated; (2) an arrest made for probable cause was not illegal even though there may have been time to have obtained a warrant; (3) whether the person who answered the door at defendant's residence was authorized to let the officers in was not at issue because an officer authorized to make an arrest was also authorized to use force if refused admittance after announcing his authority and purpose; and (4) the officers could reasonably have believed that the time required to obtain a warrant would have made breathalyzer test results inaccurate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that the theater operators were cited for operating a public place of amusement without a license. As a result of investigations by the police, building, and fire prevention departments, the owner of the theater was denied a license. The primary issue raised by the theater operators was directed to the constitutionality of the general licensing provisions of Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 101-5. The court found that the ordinance was properly construed as vesting no discretion of any kind in the mayor. If the mayor received the necessary certifications from the three designated city officials, it was his duty then to issue the license. Because there was no room for discretion on the part of the mayor, the basis for the holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional no longer existed. The ordinance was constitutionally acceptable and, holding that the ordinance did not violate the theater operators' constitutional rights as they contended and was a valid exercise of municipal power, the court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being observed by a police officer under the hood of both cars, defendant was arrested, tried, and convicted. On appeal, he contended that the State did not prove that the vehicles he allegedly &quot;tampered&quot; with were the same vehicles described in the complaints because proof of ownership was insufficient. The court found that the fact that the complaint described one car as &quot;beige&quot; and a complaining witness described it as &quot;off-white,&quot; if it was an inconsistency, was not a significant one. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the vehicles described in the complaints belonged to the complaining witnesses. Defendant also contended that one of the complaining witnesses was not a competent witness. The court ruled that despite the witness's difficulty in hearing, his testimony was clear and convincing. Defendant further argued there was a fatal variance between the name of one of the complaining witnesses as alleged in the complaint and as proved by the evidence. The court ruled that the issue was the identity of the vehicle, not the identity of the complainant. Such a variance did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant did not waive his objection to the constitutionality of &sect; 401 because he raised it in a post-trial motion and it was specifically passed upon by the circuit court. However, the court concluded that &sect; 401 was constitutional because there was a rational basis for the classifications based on the amount of substance containing the controlled substance.

He also asserted that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the applicability of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 716, which provided that certain parts of the cannabis plant were not illegal. The court held that defendant was not guilty of calculated criminal drug conspiracy because he had not personally obtained $ 500 from the conspiracy. The language of the statute did not allow for the interpretation given it by the trial court. Also, the trial court should have instructed the jury on the applicability of the statutory exemption in &sect; 716 because defendant raised the exemption as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 34-117 (1973) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 144, para. 1155 (1973).

Stat. ch. 122, para. 34-117 (1973) to maintain parental or truant schools for habitually truant students. The board filed a petition alleging that the minor was an habitual truant because she had been absent from school 63 1/2 days over two academic years. At a hearing on the petition, the board introduced evidence of nine visits at the minor's home in which it was able to establish truancy. It did not introduce evidence of the minor's absence from school on the remaining days, asserting that it was customary to present evidence of only a few days of truancy and that it was impracticable to present evidence as to every day of truancy alleged. On appeal, the minor asserted that the board failed to meet its burden of proof and that the statutes were unconstitutionally vague in that they contained no definition of habitual truancy and no standards in determining truancy. The court held that the statutes were constitutional, but that the board failed to meet its burden of proving the minor's truancy beyond a reasonable doubt. The board presented evidence of only nine days of truancy, which were insufficient to establish &quot;habitual&quot; truancy.</SPAN></P>

He made a false statement to the police, which he later corrected, to protect his friend, the seller. The State claimed that defendant's retention of the snowmobiles constituted theft and there was enough circumstantial evidence to support the conviction. The court held that the conviction was improper. The mere failure to terminate possession of the snowmobiles was not a continuing offense, and thus, the jury instructions were improper. There was insufficient evidence of guilty knowledge when defendant received the stolen goods to support a conviction under &sect; 16-1(d)(1). The court reasoned that there was an innocent explanation for defendant's actions. The evidence against defendant that he paid substantially less than retail without any warranties or a receipt from a person not regularly in the business of selling snowmobiles and that he made a false statement to the police to protect his friend was insufficient to prove guilt. The court also noted that the seller bought them from a deputy sheriff and that defendant had an excellent reputation in the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant's primary business was the operation of coin operated amusement devices. Its application for a license in the city of Springfield was denied because, under &sect; 15.8.1, only 11 licenses could be issued at one time, and all 11 had already been issued. The applicant argued that the section was arbitrary and capricious in limiting the number of operator's licenses to 11; that the number bore no reasonable relationship to the public health, welfare, or morals; and that the section was unconstitutionally vague. At the hearing, no testimonial evidence was taken. The city argued that the applicant failed to fulfill its burden of proof establishing the invalidity of the ordinance in question. The court found the record to be totally barren of any evidence presented by the applicant that could support the trial court's findings. The court noted that the record consisted primarily of arguments of counsel and colloquy between court and counsel, none of which was evidence. The applicant failed to sustain its burden in attacking the presumptive validity of the ordinance. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Board and the Environmental Protection Agency approved the sites and their operations, the Board found that the companies caused water pollution and caused a water pollution hazard in violation of &sect; 12(a), (d) of the Act. The companies claimed that the Board was estopped from enforcement. The court affirmed the Board's findings but reversed the imposition of the fines. The Board had jurisdiction because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1003 (1973) applied to all bodies of water in the state. The Board did not have to promulgate enforcement rules because it could have developed standards on a case by case basis. The Board was not estopped from its enforcement, despite the earlier approvals, because the public was entitled to a healthy environment. Estoppel could not apply to allow the pollution of the water. There was sufficient evidence that the companies created a water pollution hazard by having allowed the discharges without knowledge of the results. However, because of the earlier representations of the board and the agency, the fines were inappropriate. Also, the Board was unable to require a penal bond and a performance bond.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the record was devoid of evidence demonstrating that the provision was so clearly unreasonable as to render it void. The discrimination of which the homeowners complained was not apparent on the face of the statute nor was its relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare so attenuated as to be unreasonable.

At trial he presented evidence that the owner's daughter consented to him trading the car and was present when the trade occurred. Defendant was found guilty of theft, and sought review. The court found no error. The court held that defendant's guilt was clearly shown by the evidence presented in the trial court. The court held that it was not error to admit into evidence testimony of defendant's witness, who on cross-examination, testified that defendant stated to him that he had signed the title, in order to make the trade. The court found that the testimony prejudiced defendant's credibility and strongly corroborated a State witness' testimony, and its admission did not constitute plain error. The court held that even if it constituted error, it was harmless when viewed against the overwhelming evidence against defendant. Further, any claim of error was waived by failure of defendant to object to it. The trial court also did not err in refusing to allow into evidence proof of a close relationship of one of the complaining witness' and defendant because it failed to see how it supported defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation and defendant Department of Revenue both challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that found, in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, that sales were only subject to the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act (ROTA) and Use Tax Act (UTA) if the products were made a part of rolling stock not moving in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sold grain doors and hopper car covers to the railroads for use in connection with the shipment of grain and other loose commodities. After delivery to the railroad, the sold items were stored at various points along the railroad line pending redelivery to shippers. The department assessed the ROTA and UTA taxes on these sales, and the corporation paid under protest. In an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, the trial court found that the sales were only subject to the taxes if the doors were made a part of rolling stock not moving in interstate commerce, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the corporation was engaged in a retail occupation in Illinois so as to be subject to taxation under the ROTA based on the nature, character, and significance of its activities within the state. Those sales delivered to the purchasing railroad inside the state were subject to ROTA, whereas those sales delivered outside of the state were not subject to ROTA. However, the UTA's rolling stock exemption did not apply to the sale of hopper covers manufactured outside of the state and delivered within the state.</SPAN></P>

The sale of goods manufactured and delivered within the state were taxable under ROTA, while goods manufactured out of state and delivered within the state were taxable under the UTA. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the ex-husband on the basis that the tort action was barred by &sect; 1 of the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that although it agreed that interspousal tort immunity was an outmoded concept, it did not have the authority to judicially amend the statute since that was within the province of the legislature. The court rejected the ex-wife's claim that Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 (1970) mandated that she be provided a remedy against the ex-husband because that section did not mandate that a specific form of remedy be provided to a plaintiff. The court ruled that the ex-wife was not denied equal protection because the purpose of the Act was not to control the rights of married women. The court found that the title of the Act apprised the reader of the general subject matter and noted that there was no constitutional mandate that the subject of a bill be expressed in the title of an act.</SPAN></P>

He was put on probation, ordered to pay restitution, and ordered to spend 90 days in jail. His probation was revoked based upon the allegation that he had committed the offense of contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor. On appeal, defendant argued that he should have been credit for time served on probation and time actually spent in custody. The relevant statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4(h) (1973), prior to its amendment allowed for such credit, however after its amendment did not. The court had to determine whether the trial court applied the statute to defendant in an unconstitutional manner. The court held that the amendment increased the punishment defendant received for the offense of burglary by failing to give him credit for time served on probation. The failure of the trial court to give credit to defendant for time served on probation was erroneous and unconstitutional. The court found no merit in defendant's claim that the sentence imposed was excessive because it was within the statutory framework for the offense charged.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-10-7(a) (1973) on the ground that the juvenile correctional center was not capable of handling him. Defendant contended that he was denied due process because he was not given adequate time to prepare for the hearing on the transfer petition; that the statute authorizing the transfer was unconstitutional; and that the evidence was inadequate. In affirming the transfer order, the court reasoned that the trial court corrected any error in failing to give defendant time to prepare for the hearing by granting him a two-week extension after the State presented its evidence. Defendant waived his constitutional argument by failing to raise the issue at trial. Hearsay evidence concerning defendant's behavior at the correctional center could be relied on for the purpose of determining sentence. Under Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the circuit court dismissed the parents' amended complaint seeking damages on account of their daughter's personal injuries, the parents appealed. The court affirmed the dismissal. It confirmed the constitutionality of paragraph 24 -- 24 of the School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24 -- 24 (1973), which it held afforded the teacher with immunity from liability for negligence, conferring in loco parentis status to nondisciplinary as well as disciplinary matters. The result was that the teacher was immune from liability in the absence of proof of wilful and wanton misconduct. Moreover, the court held that the immunity afforded to the teacher was not derived from paragraph 9 -- 103(b) of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act but resulted from of a legislative determination that educators should stand in the place of a parent or guardian in matters relating to discipline, the conduct of schools, and the school children. That being the case, the district's purchase of liability insurance did not operate as a voluntary waiver of general immunity from liability for negligent misconduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed interlocutory orders from the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which were injunctions that prohibited the city from the enforcing a city ordinance against plaintiff discotheque, from revoking the discotheque's liquor license, and from interfering with the discotheque's business. The ordinance prohibited the discotheque, as a holder of an A-2 liquor license, from charging an admission fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the discotheque opened for business, the city passed the ordinance. The discotheque was granted three 10-day temporary restraining orders (TROs). On a hearing, the trial court granted the discotheque's motion for a temporary injunction, pending a resolution of the validity of the ordinance. On appeal, the court sustained the discotheque's objections to the appeal of the TROs, holding that the appeals were not perfected under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 307 (1975). The appeal of the injunction was properly perfected. The court rejected the city's assertion that the discotheque had an adequate remedy at law so as to deprive the equity court of jurisdiction. The discotheque would have been required to violate the ordinance in order to challenge its validity, and the consequences of the violation would have probably driven the discotheque out of business. The court held that the discotheque had a sufficient property interest in the privilege of the license to have entitled it to injunctive relief. The trial court had not abused its discretion in its determination to maintain the status quo pending a decision on the merits of the parties' claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's issuance of temporary restraining orders.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the search warrant was void because the complaint was signed with a fictitious name and that the statute defining the crime of syndicated gambling was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress was correctly denied because under state caselaw, the use of an assumed name by an affiant to a search warrant was permissible. The court affirmed the convictions and refused to consider the constitutional question posed by defendant's hypothetical situations because his conduct was clearly within the proscription of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion to quash the arrests and suppress the evidence, holding that the underlying statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 14-2(a) (1973), which allowed the State's attorney to consent to eavesdropping, was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment and held that defendants' argument that the statute denied equal protection, had no validity because the argument was advanced without citation to case law or legislative history. Further, the assistant State attorney had authority to have granted the request because it was shown that the State's attorney was not available.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer sought to enjoin the Department from assessing or collecting the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq. (1971), on the stated value of trading coupons issued by the retailer in its business. It further prayed for a declaratory judgment declaring that Rule 46 of the Rules of the Department of Revenue was both contrary to law and unconstitutional. The court noted that an exception to the general rule that a court of equity would not take jurisdiction of a cause when an adequate remedy was available at law was applicable to the retailer's action because the retailer filed its complaint more than 20 months before the exception was removed. Therefore, the court considered the retailer as being in constructive compliance with the statute requiring filing of the complaint within 20 days of the notice of tax liability. It was also determined that the complaint was legally sufficient. Therefore, the court held that a hearing on the merits was required. The court noted that the operative provisions of Ill. Rev.

In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court ruled that the Illinois Supreme Court had determined that the Act was constitutional. The court also ruled that his nonprobationable sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In view of the seriousness of the offense and the evil sought to be alleviated, the court ruled that the statute was not so unreasonable and arbitrary as to offend either federal or state constitutional limitations. On the merits, the court held that the word &quot;knowingly&quot; was to be read in a realistic manner so that if an accused knew that he was delivering a controlled substance, he committed the criminal act as specified in the first paragraph of &sect; 401.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of La Salle County (Illinois), which convicted him of delivery of over 30 grams of a substance containing cocaine. The trial court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of not less than eight years nor more than 24 years, to run consecutively to a previous sentence imposed on defendant for a separate drug offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After undercover agents purchased cocaine from an affiliate of defendant, the affiliate told the agents that she could obtain more cocaine. She placed a telephone call to defendant, and within 45 minutes, defendant arrived with the cocaine. The agents purchased the cocaine and left, and defendant was arrested. On appeal of his conviction, defendant alleged that the graduated penalty provision of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401 (1975) was unconstitutional, that reversible error occurred because he was arraigned without counsel, and that his sentence was excessive. In affirming the judgment, the court ruled that there was no constitutional infirmity in the classification scheme of the drug statutes. It was not unreasonable for the legislature to deal with a mixture or compound rather than with the pure drug. Because the absence of counsel at defendant's arraignment did not prejudice defendant, it did not constitute reversible error. Finally, the imposition of defendant's sentence was a matter of judicial discretion. The trial court, which did not abuse its discretion, was in a much better position than the appellate court to make a sound determination as to punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which granted the State's motion to dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief challenging the constitutionality of the aggravated incest statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-10 (1967), on the ground that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1968, petitioner pleaded guilty to aggravated incest and was sentenced to five years of probation. Four years later, his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to a term of 11 to 16 years imprisonment. On appeal of his probation revocation, the appellate court overturned the revocation. Petitioner then filed a petition for post-conviction relief asserting that the aggravated incest statute was unconstitutional because it was limited to the father-daughter relationship, creating an irrational classification based upon sex. Sexual misconduct involving a mother and son constituted incest, which carried a lesser term of imprisonment. Petitioner asserted that the punishable conduct was the same, and that he was, consequently, denied equal protection of the law as mandated by &sect; 18. The court held that &sect; 18 was inapplicable because defendant pleaded guilty in 1968 and &sect; 18 was not passed until 1970. Under traditional notions of equal protection, the statute was constitutional because there was a rational basis for distinguishing between the crimes of incest and aggravated incest and their respective sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the petition.</SPAN></P>
