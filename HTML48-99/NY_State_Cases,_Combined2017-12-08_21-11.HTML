<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant synagogue child adoption committee sought review of a resettled order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which, in a dependency proceeding, reversed the domestic relations court in all respects upon questions of law and fact, and remanded the matter to the domestic relations court in accordance with N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law. &sect; 86(3) and N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 88(1), (5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the mother's demand for the return of the children was refused she petitioned the domestic relations court to vacate its prior ex parte order that found that the children were neglected. At the hearing evidence was offered to show that the children were baptized Roman Catholic, but the mother boarded the children with a lady who caused them to be instructed in the Jewish religion. The domestic relations court ordered the children to be committed to the custody of the synagogue. The appellate division held that the domestic relations court should have committed the children to the care of a duly authorized agency under the control of the children's religious faith. The issue on appeal was whether the appellate division's order was a final determination in respect to the synagogue. On review the court held that the appellate division did not dismiss any party to the proceeding, nor did it make any conclusive ruling in respect of the rights of any party. The order did not finally determine the proceeding within the meaning of N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7(1), (7) and the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeal with costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and child - commitment of neglected children - religion of custodians - appeal to Court of Appeals - nonfinal order - (1) New York City Domestic Relations Court adjudged that children of respondent mother were neglected and committed them to care of Jewish adoption agency; evidence that they had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been baptized as Roman Catholics but had been boarded with, and reared as, Jews; Appellate Division reversed order and remanded matter for further hearing and consideration in accordance with its opinion which said that custodial agency must be of same faith as children; under such order and after such hearing, Domestic Relations Court may award custody to mother or State agency or may make new determination of children's religious affiliation and award custody to private agency of that affiliation - (2) such order of Appellate Division is nonfinal; accordingly, appeal taken to Court of Appeals as of right is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  An order of the New York City Domestic Relations Court, Children's Court Division (1) adjudged that the two children of respondent mother were neglected and that she was not a fit and proper person to have their custody, and (2) committed them to the care of a Jewish adoption agency. There was evidence at the hearing that the mother was of Roman Catholic faith and that the children had been baptized in that faith, but that she had boarded them with a person who had instructed them in the Jewish faith.  The Appellate Division reversed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the order on questions of law and fact and remanded the matter for further hearing and consideration in accordance with its opinion.  It said in such opinion that the children should have been committed to the care of an agency under the control of the children's faith (N.Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 18; N.Y. City Dom. Rel. Ct. Act, &sect; 86, subd. 3; &sect; 88, subds. 1, 5).  Under that order, the Domestic Relations Court, upon rehearing and reconsideration, may (1) award custody of the children to their mother or to a State agency, or (2) make a new judicial determination in respect of the religious affiliation of the children and then award custody of them to a private agency managed by members of their religion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The order of the Appellate Division did not dismiss any party to the proceeding or make a conclusive ruling as to the rights of any party.  It was not an adjudication of a controversy between adversary parties, but was an exercise by the State through its courts of its power as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">parens patriae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to protect infants qua infants. The order of the Appellate Division did not finally determine the proceeding within the meaning of the State Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 7, subds. [1], &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [7] ) and hence, an appeal to the Court of Appeals, taken as of right, must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant publishers appealed a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed an order striking their complete affirmative defense of privilege and partial defense of mitigating circumstances to plaintiff husband's libel action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The publishers of a newspaper and its magazine section printed an article, which repeated charges that were made by a wife against a husband in a separation action. The publishers obtained, from the files of the divorce court, and published a copy of the wife's affidavit in support of her motion for alimony. The publishers' first and complete defense in the husband's libel action alleged that the publication was privileged as a fair and true report of official and judicial proceedings. The partial defense alleged that the publication clearly indicated the reliable source on which it was based. The lower court granted the husband's motion to strike the defenses. The appellate court affirmed. The publishers appealed. The court held that the first defense was rightly stricken because the publishers' inspection of the court papers was barred by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 278, which did not violate the freedom of the press to obtain the details of a matrimonial action from another source. The court modified the order according to its opinion that the facts pleaded in the answer could have, on proof of mitigating circumstances, been sufficient as a partial defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, with costs to the husband, the order striking the privilege defense. The court modified the order to allow the publishers' partial defense to the libel action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libel and slander - privilege - (1) rule 278 of Rules of Civil Practice, directing officers of court not to allow strangers to action to examine papers in matrimonial actions without court order, does not violate freedom of press; clerk's minutes available; publication from other sources available, too, subject to liability for indefensible defamation - (2) rule 278 is derived from court rules of 1847 and is authorized by Judiciary Law ( &sect; 83) - (3) section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  337 of Civil Practice Act, allowing fair and true report of judicial or other public proceedings, does not include proceedings that are not public - (4) where newspapers, by violating rule 278, obtained copy of affidavit of plaintiff's wife filed with motion in separation action, and published defamatory charges made therein, defense of fair and true report properly stricken - (5) but order modified so as to reinstate partial defense that judicial proceedings were sources of information, as &quot;mitigating circumstances&quot; (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 338).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Rule 278 of the Rules of Civil Practice, which directs officers of the court, in a matrimonial action, not to permit persons other than parties or their counsel to examine the papers except by order of the court, does not violate constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press.  The minutes of the clerk of the court are open and will show the pendency or result of the action.  Nor does the rule prohibit publication of details of a matrimonial action that are obtained from a source other than the court files.  Of course, such a publication is actionable if defamatory but this liability for indefensible defamation is not an unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  restriction of the freedom of the press.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Rule 278 (which has been repeatedly re-enacted since 1847 by the New York Supreme Court) is within the court's rule-making power.  (Judiciary Law, &sect; 83.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 337 of the Civil Practice Act, which provides that: &quot;A civil action cannot be maintained against any person, firm or corporation, for the publication of a fair and true report of any judicial, legislative or other public and official proceedings&quot;, does not include judicial proceedings that are not public.  A contrary construction would do violence to the public policy behind the statute and would in effect nullify other statutes enacted to preserve secrecy of certain judicial records (Judiciary Law, &sect; 90, subd. 10; N.Y. City Dom. Rel. Ct. Act, &sect; 52; Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 74, subd. 6; Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 913-f, 952-t; L. 1951, ch. 716, &sect; 23).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Accordingly, where newspapers, by violating rule 278, obtained a copy of an affidavit of plaintiff's wife, which had been filed with motion papers in a separation action, and published defamatory charges therein contained against plaintiff, their defense to his libel action that they had published a fair and true report&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of judicial proceedings was properly stricken as insufficient.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  However, the order is modified so as to reinstate, as a partial defense, the plea of judicial proceedings as defendants' source of information, under section 338 of the Civil Practice Act, which says: &quot;In an action for libel or slander, the defendant may prove mitigating circumstances, including the sources of his information and the grounds for his belief, notwithstanding that he has pleaded or attempted to prove a justification.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer filed an action against respondents, the City of New York and its officers, for a refund of certain taxes and for a judgment declaring that said taxes were illegal and null and void. The taxpayer challenged an order of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the dismissal of its action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer conducted a business in which it safeguarded buildings throughout the city against burglaries. Essentially, it installed and operated alarms. The City and its officials determined that the taxpayer was providing a telegraphic service and imposed a tax on the taxpayer pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 22(8) (1938), New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; Q41-1.0. Essentially, the City had determined that the taxpayer was providing a utility service. The taxpayer filed an action against the City and its officers for a refund and for a declaratory judgment that said taxes were illegal and null and void. The trial court dismissed the action and the appellate court affirmed. The court reversed. The court found that the City's authority to tax utilities was limited by N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 186-a. The court held that &sect; 186-a was not broad enough to include the taxpayer's activities. Further, the court noted that the legislature had declined to adopt the definition of &quot;telegraphic service&quot; as provided for in New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 22(8) (1938).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate court's order that affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's action and remitted the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - municipal tax on utilities - telegraph services - statutory history - (1) burglar alarm service corporation not subject to New York City tax on utilities - (2) not claimed here that service supplied has changed since 1942 when Court of Appeals held that company's business was not that of selling electric or telegraph service; municipal power to tax electric, telephone and telegraph utilities (Tax Law, &sect; 186-a; General City Law, &sect; 20-b) not enlarged by city's own definition of telegraph service as including &quot;alarms&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Q41-1.0) - (3) Legislature refused to adopt such definition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1.  A corporation which installs in buildings electric devices whereby, in event of a wrongful breaking or entry, an alarm is mechanically transmitted by wire to one of the corporation's offices from which its guards or the city police are notified to go to the place of disturbance, is not subject to a tax imposed by the City of New York on utilities engaged in furnishing or selling electric, telephone or telegraph service.  (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Q41-1.0.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In the instant case it is not claimed that the service supplied by the company's has changed since 1942 when the Court of Appeals decided that the company's business was not the selling of electric, telephone or telegraph service (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Holmes Elec. Protective Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> McGoldrick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 288 N.Y. 635). But in 1938, after the litigation which resulted in the 1942 decision had been instituted, the city amended its local law so as to define telegraph service as including &quot;alarms * * * or information of any kind&quot;.  However, the power of a city to tax utilities is limited by State statutes (Tax Law, &sect; 186-a; General City Law, &sect; 20-b), and no definition of telegraph service is found in those statutes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3.  It is a significant item of legislative history that in 1942 the Legislature refused to amend its statutes so as to adopt the city's definition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a real estate developer and builder (the builder), appealed an order from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Suffolk County (New York) that dismissed the builder's petition for an order directing respondent, as Building and Zoning Inspector of the Town of Islip (the inspector), to issue building permits for the construction of six homes within the Town of Islip. The builder claimed that N.Y. Town Law &sect; 280-a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builder proposed to build several homes within the town on lots that lacked roads for ingress and egress. The inspector refused to grant any building permits to the builder unless the builder, pursuant to &sect; 280-a, constructed roads giving access to the proposed structures, or, in the alternative, posted a performance bond to insure the installation of such roads after erection of the buildings. The trial court dismissed the builder's N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding to compel the inspector to issue the permits and rejected the builder's claim that &sect; 280-a was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) the statute was a proper exercise of police power to ensure the public health, safety, welfare; (2) the state had a legitimate interest in requiring that the means of access provided for homes was sufficient for such a purpose; (3) the town was not condemning the builder's land, but merely required the builder to comply with reasonable conditions that worked to the benefit of the public, and thus there was no taking of his land without compensation in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towns - streets - planning - proper street access to buildings as condition for building permits - constitutional law - (1) builder's application for permit to build houses in town on lots along streets not physically in existence refused unless, under section 280-a of Town Law, streets are constructed to give access thereto or bond is procured to insure same; in proceeding to compel issuance of permits statute held constitutional and petition properly dismissed - (2) section 280-a which provides that no permit for building shall be issued unless street giving access thereto shall be &quot;suitably improved&quot;, deemed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proper exercise of police power - (3) State has legitimate interest in requiring that means of access provided for homes be properly improved and sufficient for purpose - (4) contention that compelling construction of streets on petitioner's land without compensation violates section 7 of article I of State Constitution rejected; town merely conditions approval of construction by petitioner on compliance with reasonable conditions for benefit of both ultimate purchasers and public - (5) section provides for relaxation of requirement in case of unnecessary hardship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Many of a group of 850 lots, as shown on a map filed in the Suffolk County Clerk's office in 1872, were located back from existing highways and along streets on the map which were not physically in existence.  On some of the lots, petitioner desired to build houses in accordance with the planning regulations of the town, and he applied to respondent Building and Zoning Inspector for permits which were refused unless petitioner, in accordance with section 280-a of the Town Law, should construct streets giving access to the structures or post a performance bond to insure such streets after erection of the buildings. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act to compel issuance of such building permits, Special Term properly held that the statute was constitutional and dismissed the petition.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 280-a provides that no permit for erection of a building shall be issued unless a street giving access to such building has been placed on an official map or plan, and also that such street shall have been suitably improved to the satisfaction of the town board or planning board as adequate in respect to the public health, safety and general welfare.  The requirement that the road shall be &quot;suitably improved&quot; before a permit may be issued, became a part of the Town Law in 1938, and petitioner is the first to complain that such provision or any similar provision in other statutes interferes with the proper enjoyment of his property.  However, decisions from other jurisdictions furnish persuasive support for sustaining the validity of the section as a proper exercise of the police power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  There can be no doubt, in light of the importance of proper means of access, that the regulation is reasonable and valid.  Not only is it essential to have a road over which fire apparatus&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the like can travel safely, but modern living is impossible without improved highways. Unimproved or defective roads can cause complete breakdown of services in a community, and the State has a legitimate interest in requiring that the means of access provided for homes be properly improved and sufficient for the purpose.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  While petitioner contends that, granting the necessity of such roads, it is a violation of section 7 of article I of the State Constitution to compel him to construct them on his land at his expense without compensation, the town does not seek to condemn this land.  It is petitioner who wishes to construct dwellings on his property, and the town merely conditions its approval of such construction upon his compliance with reasonable conditions designed for the protection both of the ultimate purchasers of the homes and of the public.  That the State may empower the town to do this, is clear.  The regulation here involved is not essentially different from other regulations of property in the interest of public health, safety or welfare.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  While situations may arise where compliance with such requirement would occasion unnecessary hardship, the section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  itself provides the means for relaxing such requirement, and the board of appeals is empowered to make a reasonable exception in favor of an owner in such case.  There is no violation of the State Constitution where the statute does not unreasonably deprive an owner of his property, if the statute is properly administered in accordance with its terms.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant minor sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court at a Trial Term in Orange County (New York), which denied the minor's motion for leave to serve notice of claim upon defendant, school district board of trustees (board), after the expiration of the statutory period for such service as provided in N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor was injured while on property owned and controlled by the board. Sixteen months later the minor's guardian ad litem sought leave to serve notice of claim. The trial court denied the guardian's request as untimely pursuant to &sect; 50-e. The guardian sought review arguing that &sect; 50-e was unconstitutional because it denied the minor equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's findings and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 50-e. The court held that the right to file a cause of action against a municipality was granted upon such conditions as the legislature, in its wisdom, saw fit to impose. The court held that a statutory or charter provision requiring the service of a notice of claim, as a condition precedent to an action against a municipality, was constitutional. The court held that municipalities were afforded a measure of protection against stale claims, or the possible connivance of corrupt officials. The court held that the goals sought by such enactments were not dependent upon the age of the claimant nor did they vary with the claimant's age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the findings of the trial court. The court held that the limitation period for filing a negligence claim against a municipal corporation was constitutional, even as it applied to minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - notice of claim - constitutional law - (1) claimant, six years of age, was injured by fall from slide on public school grounds; claimant's father appointed guardian ad litem sixteen months later; subsequent application for leave to file notice of claim against board of education under section 50-e of General Municipal Law properly denied - (2) section 50-e, which requires ninety days' notice of tort claim against public corporation, provides for leave to serve notice after expiration thereof where claimant is infant but application must be made within one year, so statute prevents present claimant from instituting action - (3) claimant, where under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fourteen years of age and so unable to sue directly, not deprived by statute of rights and privileges given other citizens by State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 1) and of equal protection of laws (U.S. Const., 14th Amendt.) - (4) since liability in negligence of municipalities is statutory, any liability imposed may be made subject to limitation - (5) limitations of section 50-e not dependent on age of claimant nor do they vary with such age.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Claimant, an infant six years of age, was injured by a fall from a children's slide located on school grounds controlled by defendant board of education. Sixteen months later claimant's father was appointed guardian ad litem, and subsequently such infant, by his guardian ad litem, and the father, as parent, moved for leave to serve on said board of trustees a notice of claim for personal injuries after the expiration of the statutory period for such service as provided in section 50-e of the General Municipal Law. The motion was properly denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Subdivision 1 of section 50-e requires that, where a notice of claim in a tort action is required as a condition precedent to an action against a public corporation, it must be given within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ninety days after the claim arises, and subdivision 5 provides that, where the claimant is an infant and notice is not timely filed, the court, in its discretion, may grant leave to serve the notice within a reasonable time after the expiration of the time specified, but application for such leave &quot;must be made within the period of one year&quot; after the event.  Consequently, in this case, the statute prevents claimant from instituting an action against the board.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  There is no merit in claimant's contention that since an infant under fourteen years of age may not sue directly nor initiate proceedings by application to the court for appointment of a guardian ad litem, compliance with the section is impossible, and his remedy is withdrawn before he is able to exercise it, with the result that the statute deprives him of the rights and privileges secured to other citizens by section 1 of article I of the State Constitution, and of equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The right of citizens to bring suit against boards of education for alleged negligence in performance of the governmental function of maintaining school&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  playgrounds did not exist at common law, nor has it ever been guaranteed by constitutional provision. The present rule, that the State and its municipal adjuncts are liable in negligence in the same manner as individuals or corporations, is statutory in origin, and any such right so given is one which might have been withheld by the Legislature.  Consequently, such right may be granted upon such conditions as the Legislature sees fit to impose: In this case, a limitation on the established liability.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Statutes such as section 50-e are enacted to enable municipalities to make early investigations of claims and to marshal evidence when it is possible to do so, and they afford a measure of protection against stale claims and needless litigation.  These objects are not dependent upon, nor do they vary with, claimant's age.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff minority shareholders appealed Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) judgment that affirmed the dismissal of their complaint which alleged that inadvertent expiration of defendant corporation's charter entitled them to a distribution of assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant corporation, a sightseeing company, was chartered in 1892 and did not realize its 50-year charter had expired until 1947, when it revived its charter under N.Y. Gen. Corp. Law &sect; 49 with the approval of three-fourths of the shares. Section 49 was not enacted until 1943 and plaintiff minority shareholders, who wanted a distribution of assets, contended that retroactive application of the statute unconstitutionally interfered with their vested right. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint and the court affirmed. While statutes generally were applied only prospectively, the extension of corporate charters did not involve such an organic or fundamental change as to bar retroactive application. As a de facto corporation at the expiration of its charter, no one but the state could question its existence in any event.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dismissal of plaintiff minority shareholders' complaint was affirmed, with costs, because the statute allowing revival of corporate charters was to be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - corporations - revival of corporate existence after expiration of term of charter - statutory construction - (1) language and legislative history of General Corporation Law (&sect; 49), enacted in 1944, show that it applies retrospectively to going corporation whose fifty-year charter had expired, and validly authorized filing thereafter of certificate of revival of corporate existence - (2) under section 45, which was part of corporate charter by operation of law, such certificate could have been filed before expiration of term; revival and extension thereafter under section 49 not fundamental alteration (N.Y. Const., art. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  X, &sect; 1; General Corporation Law, &sect; 5) - (3) hence, immaterial that section 49 does not give objecting minority stockholders right to be paid appraised cash value of stock - (4) minority stockholders have shown no equitable right to such appraisal and payment for their stock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The General Corporation Law (&sect; 45) provides that a corporation, the term of whose existence under its certificate of incorporation is about to expire, may file a certificate extending its corporate existence for a term of years or in perpetuity, by authority of a majority of its members or the holders of a majority of its stock. Under section 49 (eff. April 6, 1944) a like certificate may be filed after the stated term of existence of a corporation has expired (except where liquidation has been initiated and except in certain other circumstances listed in subdivision 11).  The language of section 49 and its legislative history show that it validly applies retrospectively to a going corporation such as the one in this case, which inadvertently permitted its fifty-year term of duration to expire in 1942 and which filed a certificate of revival of existence in 1947 under section 49.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  When the present&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporation was organized in 1892, the predecessor of section 45 was already in existence, and became part of the corporation's charter by operation of law. Section 49, enacted in 1944, in effect permits a going corporation, which has inadvertently omitted to file a certificate under section 45, to file one after the expiration of the term set forth in its certificate of incorporation. The new section makes no organic change and violates no constitutional prohibition against the enactment of retroactive laws.  The predecessor of section 45 required the consent of the holders of two thirds of the stock, and the revival in this case has been consented to by the holders of approximately three fourths of the stock. The State has reserved the power to alter corporation laws and charters. (N.Y. Const., art. X, &sect; 1; General Corporation Law, &sect; 5.) A corporation whose charter has expired continues to have a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de jure</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> existence for the purpose of winding up its affairs (General Corporation Law, &sect; 29).  Further, where, as here, a corporation continues to carry on its business, it is a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> corporation as well, and no one but the State may question its existence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  49 does not afford objecting minority stockholders (such as plaintiffs in this action to dissolve the corporation and distribute its assets) a right to be paid the appraised cash value of their stock. It is not necessary to determine whether such a right must be provided in order to validate an organic or fundamental change.  The extension after inadvertent expiration in this case was not such a fundamental change.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Nor is it necessary to determine whether such a minority right may exist as a matter of equity apart from statute.  There is no basis in the record for disturbing the conclusions of the courts below that the circumstances of this case do not warrant equitable relief.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which unanimously affirmed a decision and award of respondent, the Workmen's Compensation Board (board), denying to the employer a review and rehearing of an award made to respondent claimant, a widow, under New York's Workmen's Compensation Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant's deceased husband was employed as a switchman by the employer. Before death he filed a claim for disability compensation. The claim was based upon a coronary occlusion which the decedent suffered as an alleged result of extra exertion during the course of employment. The board issued three awards to the decedent, all of which were paid up until his death. The employer filed an application for review, contending that the decedent's claim was preempted by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). The board denied the application. The lower court affirmed the board's decision and the employer sought review. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that FELA did not preempt the settled claims in question. It was clear that the conduct of the parties subsequent to the board's ruling on the questions of accident and causal relation and its decree that compensation be paid, established that it was the mutual desire of the parties that the board, acting as an impartial third person, should determine the amount to be paid in discharge of the claim by the decedent. Thus, the claims fell within the ambit of N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect;113, which was found to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the widow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Master and servant - workmen's compensation - Federal Employers' Liability Act - waiver - jurisdiction of Workmen's Compensation Board - (1) application by employer for rehearing of award, after having paid disability compensation for over four years, upon ground that claim was covered by Federal Employers' Liability Act and that board accordingly was without jurisdiction, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  properly denied - (2) Congress did not intend to prohibit injured employee from compromising claim - (3) Workmen's Compensation Law ( &sect; 113) provides for awards by board where claimant, employer and carrier waive interstate commerce rights and remedies - (4) section 113 not intended to codify prior rule that only final award which had been paid precluded assertion of Federal rights; section 113 not in conflict with Federal law - (5) employer's agreement of waiver made by conduct, not by declared intention - (6) payments not rendered involuntary by employer's denial of accident and causal relation at initial hearings - (7) employer's silence and continued payments until Statute of Limitations had run on claim under Federal act, construed as acceptance of employee's offer to compromise - (8) employee's actions also amounted to waiver.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In 1945, an employee of appellant railway filed a claim with the Workmen's Compensation Board based on an asserted coronary occlusion suffered during his employment upon which an award was made for temporary total disability from the date of injury to June 5, 1945.  A second award was thereafter made for the period from June 5, 1945, to January 8, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1946, and a third award was made for the period from January 8, 1946, to February 4, 1947.  The employer, self-insured, paid all of these awards and continued to pay compensation up to December 20, 1948, pursuant to the order of the board, and, on January 3, 1949, the injured employee died.  At a subsequent hearing the employer, for the first time, challenged the jurisdiction of the board, but an award of disability compensation was made for the final two-week period preceding the employee's death.  An application by the employer for a review or rehearing of such award on the ground that at the time of the accident decedent had been employed in interstate commerce, that the case came within the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and that the Workmen's Compensation Board was without jurisdiction, was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Congress, by enacting the Federal Employers' Liability Act, has preempted the entire field of liability with respect to personal injuries of railroad employees whose duties &quot;further&quot;, or &quot;directly&quot;, or &quot;closely affect&quot; interstate commerce. The act makes void any &quot;contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever&quot; to exempt a carrier from liability.Nevertheless, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Congress did not intend to prevent an employee from disposing of a claim against his employer by entering into a compromise.  Only contracts before injury exempting the employer from liability are forbidden.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 113 of the Workmen's Compensation Law provides that awards may be made by the Workmen's Compensation Board in respect of injuries subject to the admiralty or other Federal laws in case the claimant, the employer and the insurance carrier waive their admiralty or interstate commerce rights and remedies.  In the present case the facts evidence an intention having the force of an agreement to forego rights under the Federal law and to accept rights under the Workmen's Compensation Law, and such intention has been announced by all who must participate in such an agreement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  This provision in section 113 was not intended simply to codify the rule which existed previously that only a final award of the board which had been paid - in other words, not merely an accord but a satisfaction - precluded an individual from asserting his Federal rights.  It is a permissive statute intended to empower the board to make awards of compensation if all the parties elect to settle&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their dispute in that manner and forego their Federal rights and remedies.  As so construed section 113 does not conflict with the fundamental law of the land.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  In the present action the employer made his agreement of waiver by conduct rather than by a declared intention.  Neither party's actions at the initial hearings constituted such waiver.  But their conduct subsequent to the board's ruling on the questions of accident and causal relation and its decree that compensation be paid establish that it was the mutual desire of the parties that the board should determine the amount to be paid in discharge of the employee's claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The employer's conduct in denying accident and causal relation on the initial hearings does not establish that the payments thereafter made were involuntary.  It took no appeal from any of the awards except the present appeal, which deals only with the award covering the last two weeks of the employee's life.  The employer is chargeable with knowledge that the board was without power to require it to pay compensation unless it waived its Federal rights and remedies.  Moreover, despite the fact that it appears that counsel for the employer over the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  last forty years have been cognizant of the nature of its liability to its employees, the employer made payments for four and one-half years without asserting that the board lacked jurisdiction.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  Furthermore, the employer made payments beyond the time when the Statute of Limitations had run on the employee's claim under the Federal act and the statute has also run on the death claim.  The employer cannot lead the employee to believe that it is agreeable that the board shall act without having its silence construed as an acceptance of the employee's offer to compromise the claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  By his actions before the board, the employee also evidenced his willingness to submit the dispute to the board for determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city brought an action against defendant company to restrain the company from violating the city's residential zoning laws. The trial court found for the city. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) reversed and dismissed the complaint. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company leased premises within the city for use as a private garage for the storage and repair of trucks and as a terminal for freight shipping. The property was located in a residential area and was nonconforming to the city's zoning ordinances. The premises had earlier been used for a public garage in an area zoned for business use. The area was then rezoned residential. The court found that the use of the public garage was a lawful nonconforming use. The company's subsequent use of the structure as freight terminal was not a continuation of that prior use. The ordinance restricted freight terminals to industrial zones. The ordinance only allowed a change in a nonconforming use only to a more restrictive use. The transformation of the public garage to the freight terminal was not a change to a more restrictive nonconforming use. Also, the nonconforming use altered the essential character of the residential area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Under a lease permitting lessee motor carrier to use premises for a truck terminal and other activities in connection therewith, and after a revocable permit had been obtained from the director of buildings of the city of Buffalo to use the building for a &quot;Garage &amp; Truck Terminal&quot; subject to the zoning ordinance, defendant interstate motor carrier used the premises as a terminal for freight shipped into, or out of, said city.  Some remodeling of the premises was done when defendant went into possession, including the installation of a loading dock, and operations are presently carried on twentyfour hours a day by about 71 employees.  Each day about 12 of the carrier's trailers arrive at and depart from the premises, and about twice that many tractors, and freight is delivered for shipment by other carriers in their own trucks. Under the provisions of the present zoning ordinances of the city of Buffalo, the premises are in a second residence district, and the use above outlined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is clearly nonconforming. At the time the original ordinances were adopted, the premises were placed in a business district and were then being used as a public garage. A public garage was a permitted use only in a first industrial district.  As a matter of right, the owners of the property thereafter continued to operate the garage as a continuation of a use lawful prior to the adoption of the zoning ordinances. In this action by the city of Buffalo to restrain the carrier and lessor from using the premises in alleged violation of the zoning ordinances, judgment in favor of the city should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The present use is not a continuation of the former use, nor the equivalent thereof, but is that of a freight terminal rather than a &quot;public garage&quot; within the definition thereof in the ordinance. The activities of the carrier resemble neither the ordinance definition nor the common concept of a public garage but fall within the term &quot;freight terminal&quot; as used in the ordinance for a use permitted in the first industrial district.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  A contention that the words &quot;freight terminal&quot;, as used in the ordinance, cannot be applied to motor truck freight terminals since such were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not within the contemplation of the framers of the ordinance in 1925, is without merit.  Such a terminal is not essentially different from any other freight terminal. What was originally confined to an industrial district was the operation of handling freight at a terminal point, and it can make no difference what the means of transporting the freight to that point may be.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Originally the ordinance provided that a nonconforming use should not be changed &quot;except&quot; to a more restrictive use, but this was later amended to read that premises devoted to a nonconforming use &quot;may be changed in use, when changed to a more restricted use&quot;.  While zoning statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of the landowner, courts may not disregard the intention of the legislative body when it is clearly to be found in the language used.  Here, in view of the language, no distinction can be made between the original, and the present, wording of the ordinance. Since the present use is not more restrictive than the former nonconforming use, it is illegal and may be enjoined. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The neighborhood has an established residential character, as was recognized by the 1946 amendment rezoning the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  area from business to second residential, but the use to which defendants have now put that property cannot fail to alter the essential character of an otherwise residential neighborhood and to render it not merely commercial but industrial in nature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The issuance of a permit by the director of buildings cannot help defendant, for such a permit cannot confer rights in contravention of the zoning laws. Moreover, the ordinance provides that any permit for the use of premises contrary to the provisions thereof shall be void.  In addition, the permit was issued for a &quot;Garage &amp; Truck Terminal&quot;, not for a freight terminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The asserted unconstitutionality of the ordinance rests upon a claim that the city means to limit use of the property to second residential purposes, despite the prior use and the impossibility of adapting the building to residential use, but the record discloses no such intent or threat on the part of the city.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant bus company challenged an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the third judicial department (New York) that found that plaintiff state was entitled to recover a penalty under N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 63-c after the bus company failed to obtain authorization from the state public service commission to enter into a conditional sales contract for the purchase of buses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bus line, which operated a service in New York, entered into a conditional sales contract for the purchase of buses without obtaining authorization from the state public service commission pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 62. The lower court found that the state was entitled to recover a penalty from the bus line, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding first that the bus company was required to obtain authorization under &sect; 62 because the statute covered conditional sales contracts. The court also held that Congress had not occupied the field so as to exclude the state legislation and that it was clear that Congress had purposely excluded from the field of its legislative competency small interstate omnibus companies such as the bus company and conditional sales contracts of all omnibus companies of any size. The court found that in the absence of conflicting federal legislation, a state could make laws for the common good that affected or regulated interstate commerce. Section 62 was a reasonable exercise by the state of its police power to protect customers and creditors of the bus company from loss of service from uncontrolled financing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's order that found that the state was entitled to recover a penalty from the bus company after the bus company failed to obtain authorization from the state public service commission to enter into a conditional sales contract for the purchase of buses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - interstate commerce - public utilities - omnibus corporations - statutory construction - (1) omnibus corporation &quot;may issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness&quot; provided it obtains authorization of Public Service Commission (Public Service Law, &sect; 62, subd. 1); bus corporation which executed conditional sales contract for balance of purchase price of ten buses, without obtaining authorization from commission, must pay penalty to People (&sect; 63-c) - (2) inclusive phrase, &quot;notes or other evidences of indebtedness&quot;, was enacted instead of proposed phrase &quot;or other form of security issue&quot;; legislative history of statute shows intention to regulate financial obligations so as to protect bus-using and ratepaying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  public, and it has been so administered - (3) Federal Motor Carrier Act has not pre-empted field, since it regulates only security issues and only carriers with securities of over half million dollars; therefore State Public Service Commission may continue to regulate smaller bus corporations and their conditional sales contracts, even though bus line is interstate - (4) State act does not obstruct interstate commerce - (5) State act is reasonable exercise of police power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Public Service Law ( &sect; 62, subd. 1) provides that &quot;An omnibus corporation organized or existing * * * under or by virtue of the laws of the state of New York, may issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness payable on demand or at periods of more than twelve months after the date thereof * * * provided and not otherwise that there shall have been secured from the commission an order authorizing such issue&quot;.  A New York corporation, which operates a bus line between a city in New York State and a city in the State of Connecticut and over connecting routes within New York State, purchased ten buses for approximately $160,000 and entered into a conditional sales contract for part of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purchase price.  For its failure to obtain authorization of the Public Service Commission to enter into such contract, the corporation must pay a penalty to the People of the State of New York (pursuant to Public Service Law, &sect; 63-c).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The legislative history of section 62 shows that it was enacted to protect the bus-using and rate-paying public against improper issues of obligations by a public utility, and not merely to regulate the marketability of securities for investors.  Furthermore, when the precursor to the present statute was first proposed and enacted in 1907, the proposed words &quot;stocks, bonds, evidence of indebtedness or other form of security issue&quot; were stricken from the bill and the words above quoted enacted.  Those words, within the legislative intention and within the administrative practice of the commission, include a conditional bill of sale to finance a purchase.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935 (U.S. Code, tit. 49, &sect; 301 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) was not intended to supersede section 62 of our Public Service Law. The Federal act regulates only motor carriers which have issued securities exceeding $500,000 - which this carrier had not.  Moreover, the Federal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  act regulates &quot;securities&quot; and has been construed by the Interstate Commerce Commission not to include a conditional sales contract. Thus the Federal and State acts can logically and practically coexist.  Congress has not evinced an intention to pre-empt the field as to motor carriers or as to their conditional bills of sale.  As long as the Federal Government does not choose to regulate the execution of conditional sales contracts by omnibus corporations, there is no reason why our Public Service Commission should not continue such regulation through the provisions of section 62 of our Public Service Law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Congressional power to regulate interstate commerce (U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8) does not exclude powers &quot;reserved to the States&quot; (10th Amendt.).  In a field where national uniformity is not demanded, and where Congressional legislation has not covered the subject matter of the State statute, and where application of the latter will not obstruct interstate commerce, the State statute will be upheld.  State highways are, of course, subject to regulation by the State in the public interest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.Section 62 of our Public Service Law helps to ensure the general financial responsibility&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a public utility operating under a franchise granted by this State, and thereby to protect the public against interruptions or deprivations of bus service.  The statute is not drastic or discriminatory, but is a reasonable exercise by the State of its police power to protect customers and creditors of a small bus corporation from the danger of high rates or loss of service resulting from uncontrolled financing.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the fourth judicial department (New York), which affirmed the judgment of the county court that convicted defendants of the wrongful possession of a machine gun in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, two brothers, operated a business that distributed and serviced pinball machines. A machine gun and ammunition was found in defendants' store. Defendants were convicted of the wrongful possession of a machine gun. The court affirmed. The statute created a presumption that the possession of such a gun was in the illegal possession of all persons that occupied the place where the gun was found. The court found that it was neither unreasonable nor unfair to presume that defendants were aware of the gun in the store. The statute did not oppressively burden the accused. Defendants had the opportunity to rebut the presumption, which they failed to do. The prosecutor still had the burden of proving defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, defendants were not denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - crimes - unlawful possession of machine gun - statutory presumption that machine gun found in occupied room is illegally possessed by occupants - (1) Penal Law (&sect; 1897, subd. 1-a) constitutionally provides that unauthorized possession of machine gun is felony and that &quot;presence of such machine-gun in any room * * * shall be presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by all the persons occupying the place&quot;; on evidence that machine gun had been found in one-room store used by defendants for pinball machine distributing business, judgments of conviction affirmed - (2) statutory presumption reasonably based&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on life's experiences; defendants may rebut presumption; jury may refuse to convict despite lack of explanation by defendants; burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt still rests on People - (3) unnecessary, on these facts, to consider whether statutory presumption applies equally to &quot;room, dwelling, structure or vehicle&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Penal Law (&sect; 1897, subd. 1-a) constitutionally provides that possession of a machine gun (except by police and other designated classes of persons in the discharge of their official duties) is a felony, and that &quot;The presence of such machine-gun in any room, dwelling, structure or vehicle shall be presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by all the persons occupying the place where such machine-gun is found.&quot; Judgments of conviction under this statute should be affirmed, where a machine gun and ammunition for it were found in a one-room store occupied - or so the jury could have concluded from the evidence - by defendants and used by them in connection with their business of distributing and servicing pinball machines.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The statutory presumption has a reasonable basis in life's experiences which teach that the presence of a machine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gun in a room occupied either as a residence or for a business has a sinister and inculpatory significance, that normally the persons who occupy a room in which there is found such a large and uncommon object are conscious and knowing of it, and that their possession of such a death-dealing weapon is not law-abiding.  In this case, the accused have had every opportunity to rebut the presumption and to explain the proof that the machine gun was found in a room occupied by them.  Even if they offer no explanation, the jury may still refuse to convict. The burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains with the prosecution and defendants' right to a fair trial continues undiminished.  No constitutional right or safeguard has here been shown to have been impaired by the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  On the facts of this case, it is not necessary to consider whether the statutory presumption validly applies, not only to a &quot;room,&quot; but also to a &quot;dwelling, structure or vehicle&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner former licensee sought review of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which confirmed a determination by respondent licensor to cancel licenses for the film &quot;The Miracle&quot; because it was deemed sacrilegious in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent licensor canceled licenses for petitioner former licensee's film &quot;The Miracle&quot; because it was deemed sacrilegious. The lower court confirmed respondent's determination, and the court affirmed the order. The court held that a public showing of an obscene, indecent, immoral, or sacrilegious film could do incalculable harm and that, under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 122, the state could afford protection as broad as the danger presented. The court held that the action of the motion picture division of the state education department was reviewable by respondent in any case where the license was refused or granted. The court held that the word &quot;sacrilegious&quot; provided a sufficiently definite standard and that the film encroached upon the sacred relationship between Jesus Christ, Mary, and Joseph, and the biblical presentation of the birth of Christ, associating it with drunkenness, seduction, mockery, and lewdness. The statute was clearly directed to the promotion of the public welfare, morals, public peace, and order, objects of police power, and any incidental benefit conferred upon religion was not sufficient to render the statute unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - statutory construction - police power - motion picture licenses - freedom of religion - (1) Board of Regents had power to cancel, upon ground that motion picture was sacrilegious, licenses previously issued by motion picture division of State Education Department - (2) power to cancel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  license in such circumstances is implicit in constitutional and statutory provisions for licensing of motion pictures; express grant of power unnecessary - (3) Legislature did not intend to prohibit review of determinations of said motion picture division - (4) rights acquired under licenses not contractual - (5) Education Law ( &sect; 122) prohibiting license for film deemed sacrilegious provides sufficiently definite standard - (6) Board of Regents did not act arbitrarily or capriciously - (7) Education Law ( &sect; 122) does not violate First Amendment to Federal Constitution, dealing with religious freedom - (8) licensee, seeking benefits under statute, may not argue that motion pictures must be granted constitutional protection of press - (9) in any event, United States Supreme Court has decided to contrary - (10) at time decisions rendered by Supreme Court technical developments increasing impact of motion pictures were foreseen.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York had the power and rightfully exercised its jurisdiction to cancel licenses issued by the motion picture division of the State Department of Education for the exhibition of a motion picture&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entitled &quot;The Miracle&quot; (part of a trilogy called &quot;Ways of Love&quot;) upon the ground that said picture was sacrilegious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The history of the statutory provisions for the licensing of motion pictures, the constitutional grant of power to the Board of Regents to appoint and remove a Commissioner of Education, the naming of the Regents as head of the Education Department in the same paragraph of the Constitution as the Governor, Comptroller, and Attorney-General (N.Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 4), the placing of the former independent motion picture commission in the Department of Education, the statutory grant of power to the board to appoint the director, officers and employees of the motion picture division, to prescribe their powers and duties and to fix their compensation, to establish local offices of the division, and to enforce the provisions and purposes of the statute governing the said division, indicate that the division is subordinate to the Education Department and the Board of Regents, and not independent thereof, and that the Regents had the power, implicit in their broad powers, to review and to cancel licenses previously granted.  An express grant of power was unnecessary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since such power is essential to the exercise of the powers expressly granted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Legislature did not intend that the protection of the public from films intended to be denied a license under the Education Law ( &sect; 122) should rest entirely on the judgment of one or two persons in the motion picture division, without review of such action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Rights acquired under licenses issued in an exercise of police power are not contractual in the constitutional sense, notwithstanding the expenditure of money by the licensee in reliance thereon.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 122 of the Education Law, insofar as it provides that a license shall not be issued for the exhibition of a film which is &quot;sacrilegious&quot;, does not delegate legislative power without an adequate standard.  The dictionary definition of &quot;sacrilegious&quot; as &quot;the act of violating or profaning anything sacred&quot; is clear, and it has been determined by the courts that the word &quot;sacrilegious&quot; and its synonym, &quot;profane&quot;, provide a sufficiently definite standard.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The picture itself, depicting a demented peasant girl who is caused to become intoxicated and then seduced by a stranger whom she addresses as &quot;St. Joseph&quot;, the personalities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  involved, the use of scriptural passages, other portions of the script, and the title of the film support the conclusion that, in reaching its determination, the Board of Regents did not act arbitrarily or capriciously.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The statute does not violate the provisions of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution relating to religious freedom since (a) religious presentations, as well as educational and scientific films, are exempt (Education Law, &sect; 123) and no one is prevented by the statute from propagating his own religious view by means of motion pictures; (b) the Regents are not required to form religious judgments in order to determine whether a film is sacrilegious. The standard applied is that no religion shall be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn and ridicule by those engaged in selling entertainment by way of motion pictures; (c) the statute is directed to the promotion of the public welfare, morals, peace and order and the fact that some benefit may incidentally accrue to religion is not sufficient to render the statute unconstitutional; (d) denial of the right of the government to interfere to protect religious beliefs from private or commercial attacks or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  persecution is a denial of its power to keep the peace and of the right of the free exercise of religion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  Since the licensee sought and obtained benefits under the statute and seeks to retain the licenses granted, such licensee may not argue that the statute is unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">in toto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a prior restraint on the right of free speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  But, in any event, it has been decided that motion pictures are primarily a form of entertainment and not in the same category as the press as vehicles of thought ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mutual Film Corp. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Industrial Comm. of Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 236 U.S. 230; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mutual Film Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Industrial Comm. of Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 236 U.S. 247; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mutual Film Corp. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Hodges</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 236 U.S. 248). The Court of Appeals will not predict that the United States Supreme Court will overrule these cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.  Technical developments since the foregoing cases were decided, which have allegedly changed the nature of motion pictures, were foreseen in those cases and were realized at the time of the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">RD-DR Corp. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Smith</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (183 F. 2d 562 [1950], certiorari denied 340 U.S. 853).

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the district's petition on the merits. Because the district superintendent's order of dissolution and annexation of District No. 2 was upheld on appeal and the matter was one affecting the administration of the educational system, the determination was final as to the district.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - central school districts - union free school districts - common school districts - district superintendents - constitutional powers of Commissioner of Education - (1) determination of Commissioner of Education, affirming decision of appellate committee appointed by county judge which affirmed order of supervisory district superintendent dissolving common school district and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  annexing its territory to adjoining union free school district, not reviewable as far as it concerns school districts (Education Law, &sect;&sect; 310, 1505) - (2) supervisory district superintendent had discretionary power to make such order, although voters of that and other common school districts had petitioned their trustees for voluntary consolidation into different union free school district; after their vote, his statutorily required order designating their consolidated district (Education Law, &sect;&sect; 1513, 1523) rightly excepted common school district which he had dissolved - (3) thus, since such common school district never became part of consolidated district, latter cannot question power of Commissioner of Education to make order incorporating such common school district with other districts into one central school district - (4) in laying out central school districts, Commissioner of Education may include all or part of any existing school districts (N.Y. Const., art. V, &sect;&sect; 2, 4; art. XI, &sect; 1; Education Law, &sect;&sect; 1801, 1802, 1803-a); order here rightly included such common school district regardless of whether it was part of voluntarily consolidated union free school district or part&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of district to which district superintendent had annexed it - (5) territory of school districts may be altered by administrative acts of officers of State Education Department - (6) district may not complain that its loss of assessed valuation of transferred territory reduces security of its bonds - (7) determination of commissioner not arbitrary; approved by voters of central school district by ratio of three to one.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A determination of the Commissioner of Education, affirming a decision of an appellate committee appointed by a county judge, which decision affirmed an order of a supervisory district superintendent dissolving a common school district and annexing its territory to an adjoining union free school district (Education Law, &sect;&sect; 310, 1505), is a matter of administration of the State educational system and therefore is not reviewable by the courts, so far as it concerns a member of that system - the board of education of a union free school district, which is the petitioner in this proceeding to review and to set aside or modify said determination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The supervisory district superintendent acted within his discretionary power, even though his order of dissolution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and annexation was made after voters of the common school district and other common school districts had petitioned their trustees to take action for voluntary consolidation into a different union free school district.  When, thereafter, the voters did vote for such different union free school district, the district superintendent had, as a ministerial act, to designate it as such a district under the statute [Education Law, &sect;&sect; 1513, 1523], but his order of designation refused to include the common school district as to which he had already exercised his discretionary power, and his decision was upheld on appeal to the Commissioner of Education.  Thus, the excepted common school district never became part of the voluntarily consolidated union free school district.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">City of New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Porter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 299 N.Y. 587, distinguished.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Therefore, the voluntarily consolidated union free school district has no standing to question (as it attempts to do in this proceeding), the power of the Commissioner of Education to make an order incorporating the excepted common school district, together with other common school districts and union free school districts, into one central school&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  district.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Commissioner of Education had power to order, as he did, that the new central school district should include the excepted common school district &quot;whether the same is now part of&quot; the union free school district to which the district superintendent annexed it &quot;or part of&quot; the voluntarily consolidated union free school district.  The commissioner, in laying out a central school district, has constitutionally been given power to include all or part of an existing school district. (N.Y. Const., art. V, &sect;&sect; 2, 4; art. XI, &sect; 1; Education Law, &sect;&sect; 1801, 1802, 1803-a; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gardner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Ginther</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 232 App. Div. 296, affd.  257 N.Y. 578, followed.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  A school district is a municipal corporation within the General Corporation Law (&sect; 3) but not within the General Municipal Law ( &sect; 51).  Its territory is subject to change through acts of the administrative officers of the State Education Department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  That the loss of territory having substantial assessed valuation reduces the security of bonds of the district is not sufficient ground for objection by the district.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist. No. 6 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist. No.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> 7</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 76 App. Div. 355, affd.  179 N.Y. 556, followed.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The laying out of the central school district by the Commissioner of Education was not arbitrary.  It carried out the recommendation of the Joint Legislative Committee on the State Education System, the determinations of the district superintendent and the committee on appeal therefrom, and the results of the commissioner's own investigation.  The dissolved common school district had, for nineteen years, maintained no district school but had sent its pupils to the adjoining union free district school. The new central school district will result in improved buildings and transportation and kindergarten and high school opportunities and has been approved by a three-to-one vote of the inhabitants of such central school district.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pavers sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the first judicial department (New York), which affirmed the denial of the pavers' application to remove names from a pavers list, and reversed an order nullifying a promotion examination held for the position of rammer and directing that only persons on a specified list be certified as eligible for the rammer position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pavers sought on order directing respondent, the Municipal Civil Service Commission, to remove persons from the paver list on the ground that such persons did not have five years' satisfactory experience as paver or a satisfactory equivalent; to nullify all proceedings had with reference to a promotion examination for rammer; and to certify as eligible for the position of rammer the list of eligibles for the position of paver. On appeal, the court affirmed the nonremoval of certain persons from the pavers list. The requirement of a satisfactory equivalent in lieu of five years' satisfactory experience as a paver was not so vague and indefinite as to be unconstitutional. The court reversed regarding the rammer examination and eligibility. The court found that the commission acted contrary to law, in giving the rammer examination as a promotion examination open to laborer employees. The position of rammer was classified in a skilled part of the competitive class, whereas the position of laborer was in a wholly different class and ungraded. The court found that the paver list was the existing eligible list most nearly appropriate from which to make appointments to rammer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order refusing to remove any eligibles from the paver list.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - New York City - civil service - appointment and promotion - (1) in open competitive municipal civil service examination, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requirement of five years' experience or &quot;satisfactory equivalent&quot; is valid - (2) but promotion examination to position of rammer in skilled craftsman service of competitive class may not be given to laborers in ungraded labor class who never took open competitive examination for &quot;lower grade&quot; of rammer type of work (Civil Service Law, &sect; 16); words &quot;lower but corresponding character&quot; in rule of municipal civil service commission may not be read to contrary - (3) since such promotion list to rammer is illegal, and since open competitive paver list is most nearly appropriate (Civil Service Law, &sect; 14, subd. 8), appointments as rammer must be made from paver list, until proper rammers' list is promulgated - (4) Statute of Limitations in proceeding under article 78 of Civil Practice Act runs from time when first appointment is made from illegal list.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In an open competitive civil service examination for the position of paver in the city of New York, a requirement of five years' satisfactory experience as a paver or a &quot;satisfactory equivalent&quot; is not so vague as to be unconstitutional, or so clearly irrelevant and unreasonable as to authorize the courts to set aside an eligible list&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  established as a result of the examination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  However, the municipal civil service commission had no power to give to &quot;laborers&quot; in the ungraded labor class, a promotion examination to the position of rammer in the &quot;skilled craftsman and operative service&quot; of the competitive class. Under section 16 of the Civil Service Law, promotion examinations may be given only to persons who have passed an open competitive examination for a &quot;lower grade&quot; in the type of work involved in the position to which it is sought to promote them.  A rule of the municipal civil service commission which was apparently designed to implement the statute, but used the words &quot;lower but corresponding character&quot;, may not be read to the contrary.  These laborers never took an open competitive examination which tested their skill as rammers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Since the only promotion list for rammer was not legally created, and since this record shows that the paver list is the existing eligible list most nearly appropriate (Civil Service Law, &sect; 14, subd. 8) from which to make appointments to rammer, appointments to that position should be made from it, at least until a proper rammers' list is promulgated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  present proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act was timely brought and the petitioners (pavers) were not guilty of laches.Petitioners were harmed, not when the promotion examination for rammer was held or the list promulgated, but when the first appointment was made from the list; and they brought this proceeding a month later.  </SPAN></P>

The court distinguished the case from a United States Supreme Court case, which had struck down an Illinois &quot;released time&quot; program. The court noted that, in Illinois, the instruction took place on school grounds, school officials supervised and approved the religious teachers, and pupils were solicited in school buildings for religious instruction. To the contrary, in the New York program, there was neither supervision nor approval of religious teachers and no solicitation of pupils, and the religious instruction was held outside the school building and grounds. The court noted that the Supreme Court had never held that &quot;released time&quot; programs per se violated the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The rules of the commissioner provide for such absence for not more than one hour each week at the close of a day's session, to attend courses given outside the school grounds by duly constituted religious bodies, upon written request of parent or guardian, and that registration and attendance reports must be filed by the religious organizations with the public school authorities.  The Regulations of the New York City Board of Education provide that the released hour in the schools in the borough of Brooklyn shall be on Wednesday, and that &quot;There will be no announcement of any kind in the public schools relative to the program.  * * * There shall be no comment by any principal or teacher on the attendance or non-attendance of any pupil upon religious instruction.&quot; The New York City board provides more days a year for secular instruction than are required by law (Education Law, &sect; 3204, subd. 4).

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The petition in this proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act was rightly dismissed on the merits without a trial.  The allegations of fact, as well as the many merely conclusory allegations merely suggest disobedience of regulations by some teachers or principals which might warrant disciplinary proceedings but not the total discontinuance of the released time program.  Such allegations do not show a pattern of discrimination consciously practiced.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought an order quashing subpoenas issued by the New York State Crime Commission. Petitioner alleged that there was no statutory authority for the creation of the New York State Crime Commission. The lower court denied petitioner's application. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. According to the court, N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 62(8) did not expressly authorize by statute the creation of the New York State Crime Commission. However, the court determined that the appointment of the individual mention in the governor's executive order by the state attorney general was proper. The court further held that the topic or areas that were to be investigated by the &quot;commission&quot; were within the purview of &sect; 62(8). The court stated that organized crime and its relationship to units of government in the state were matters concerning the public peace, public safety and public justice. Moreover, the court held that the mere fact that the appointed individuals called themselves the New York State Crime Commission was of no consequence. Lastly, the court found that the legislature properly conferred the authority upon the executive department to exercise subpoena power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  By a subpoena issued over the names of the members of the &quot;New York State Crime Commission&quot; and the Attorney-General and signed by the Chief Counsel to the commission and a Special Assistant Attorney-General, petitioner was commanded to appear before said commission to give evidence in an inquiry into matters concerning &quot;the public peace, public safety and public justice, as directed by the Executive Order of the Governor&quot;.  The Executive Order named five men as constituting the commission to investigate and take action concerning the relationship between organized crime and government and specified certain duties and powers.  By the order the Attorney-General was directed, under the terms of subdivision 8 of section 62 of the Executive Law, to inquire into matters involving the &quot;public peace, public safety and public justice&quot; and was &quot;requested&quot; to do so by appointing the members of the commission for such purpose, and the commission, together with the Attorney-General, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (a) were directed to exercise all powers under said section 62 which the Governor had the power to delegate, and (b) were authorized to administer oaths and to subpoena any person or records.  The Attorney-General thereupon appointed each of the five men mentioned in the order as an officer of the State Department of Law and a member of the &quot;New York State Crime Commission&quot;.  An order of Special Term denying petitioner's application to vacate and quash the subpoena should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Subdivision 8 of section 62 of the Executive Law provides that the Attorney-General may, with the approval of the Governor, inquire into matters concerning &quot;the public peace, public safety and public justice&quot; for which purpose he may, in his discretion, employ such officers as he deems necessary and that he and other officers delegated by him are empowered to subpoena witnesses.  The Governor directed the Attorney-General to act under subdivision 8 of section 62 and the action of the Attorney-General in appointing the persons named was in accordance with the terms of the statute.  He was not deprived of the discretion granted in making these appointments since he was not directed, but merely &quot;requested&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to do so.  Nor is it of moment that the members of the commission are not all lawyers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  In granting authority to inquire into matters concerning the &quot;public peace, public safety and public justice&quot; the statute used language sufficiently broad to include an investigation such as this, where the principal purpose is to determine whether a relationship exists between organized crime and any units of government.  It is clear that organized crime and its relationship to units of the State Government are &quot;matters concerning the public peace, public safety and public justice&quot; within the meaning of subdivision 8 of section 62 of the Executive Law.  The Legislature, therefore, had the power, under the State Constitution, to authorize the investigation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Legislature may constitutionally confer authority upon the Executive Department to exercise subpoena power in connection with an investigation in aid of the executive function.  Under the Constitution (art. IV, &sect; 3), it is the Governor's duty to communicate to the Legislature the &quot;condition of the state&quot; with recommendations and to &quot;take care&quot; that the laws are faithfully executed. If there be a relationship between organized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  crime and units of government in the State, and if there be defects in the existing relationship between the State Government and local law enforcement, these are matters affecting &quot;the condition of the state&quot; which should be communicated to the Legislature with appropriate recommendations for their elimination.  If existing laws be adequate, at least the Governor would have additional information so that he might &quot;take care that the laws are faithfully executed.&quot; Since there exists a reasonable relation between the action taken by the Governor, through the Attorney-General, and the proper discharge of the executive function, it cannot be said that subdivision 8 of section 62, as here applied, is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The fact that the Attorney-General and the members of the commission in discharging their duty may find it necessary to inquire as to whether individual crimes have been committed does not constitute usurpation by the investigation of the traditional province of the grand jury in each county of the State.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city appealed a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the dismissal of a taxpayer's complaint, denied the city's motion to dismiss, granted a temporary injunction, and certified to the court the question of whether the trial court properly granted the city's motion to dismiss the complaint, in an action brought under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city entered into a contract with a company under which the city agreed to acquire property by condemnation, pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 72-j(3), to offer it at public auction, for a term of 50 years, subject to conditions providing for the construction of a public parking garage, and for commercial facilities. The taxpayer contended that the contract was illegal because inter alia, (1) the use contemplated was not public but private; (2) it was not authorized, (3) even if authorized and found in some respects to be public in nature, it was so subordinated to the private benefit of the company that the end result was a private use. The court found that it could not say as a matter of pleading that no cause of action whatsoever was set forth, and that no triable issues were presented. Sufficient facts were alleged purporting to show that the public use here might be only incidental and in large measure subordinate to the private benefit to be conferred on the company, and not for the purposes authorized by the statute. This was not a case to be decided on the pleadings. The constitutionality of the regulations must be decided after the facts were determined on the trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  On a motion to dismiss a complaint for legal insufficiency, such pleading must be given the benefit of every favorable inference notwithstanding that the proof may fall short of the allegations.  Triable issues are presented&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the complaint in this taxpayer's action for an injunction under section 51 of the General Municipal Law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 72-j of the General Municipal Law authorizes a municipality, in order to relieve traffic congestion, to acquire real property by condemnation and to lease it for &quot;parking garages or parking spaces&quot;.  A contract has been entered into between the City of New York and an insurance corporation whereby the city agrees to acquire by condemnation a parcel of real property and then at public auction to lease it for fifty years.  Further provisions are that the corporation will bid; that the successful bidder, as lessee, will remove the tenants, who number over 100, and will build a public parking garage (title to which shall vest in the city) for at least 750 cars; that the building may include stores and other commercial facilities; that the lessee may determine the amount of space to be allotted to comply with a recommendation of the traffic commission that such a garage would fill a need for storage space for cars of nearby residents and will afford limited space for transient parking; that the lessee will pay an initial rent equal to the condemnation awards, expenses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and taxes, and an annual rent of at least $25,200, and may charge garage rates to be approved by the city and which will bring the lessee a 6% annual return on its broadly defined investment.  Plaintiff taxpayer alleges facts to show that such contract contemplates primarily a storage garage rather than a public parking garage; that after the corporation has provided storage space for its tenants and made provision for the 308 now existing car spaces in the area to be condemned, the net gain for the general public will be only 17 spaces; that many specifications will benefit the corporation and discourage other bidders and will not benefit the public, such as the limitation to two stories (notwithstanding expensive subcellar construction) which does not help to relieve parking congestion but grants easements of light and air for the corporation's high rent apartment house across the street; the landscaping of the garage roof for an elevated public park on the southerly half and a strictly private park on the northerly half, for its tenants to view, rather than employing same for parking purposes; the construction of a center mall, necessitating the widening of a street, only to create&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a bottleneck at each end and to locate entrances and exits opposite the corporation's apartment house; the onerous financial requirements for a probable outlay of $4,000,000, without right to mortgage; all of which, taken together with other allegations of the complaint, present triable issues as to whether the taking is primarily for a private, rather than a public, use.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  A use is not public where the public benefit is only incidental to a private benefit.  Moreover, the validity of a statute upon one set of facts is immaterial if in its application to another situation it results in invalidity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Other questions, such as the legality of the city's agreement to rezone the area for the purposes of the lease, or its power to lease its property for more than ten years (New York City Charter [1938], &sect; 384, subd. b), are not passed upon at this time.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the first judicial department (New York), which unanimously affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant, upon his guilty plea, of one crime of conspiracy N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 580, and of 59 crimes of book-making in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 986. His total sentence, on all 60 counts, was five years' imprisonment and $ 30,000 in fines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 986 penalized only the operating of a bookmaking business, and that, accordingly, the nonconspiracy counts in the information (numbers 2 to 60) charged not 59 crimes, but one crime, and could result in one sentence only. His second point was that if these were 60 different crimes, then N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2190, authorizing separate consecutive sentences on those 60 counts, was unconstitutional under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, and 6, and N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18. The court disagreed with defendant's arguments and held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 986 was a listing of a number of different kinds of acts or conduct, all of them related to &quot;book-making,&quot; each of which was a separate misdemeanor. Therefore, defendant was charged with 60 different crimes. The court also held that, under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2190, a number of related offenses could be covered by the same indictment or information, and that for each such count on which defendant was found guilty, he could receive a separate and cumulated sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment and defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - sentence - (1) one who pleaded guilty in court of special sessions to sixty counts of information, first of which charged conspiracy to violate section 986 of Penal Law (&quot;book-making&quot;) and remaining fifty-nine charged separate violations of same section, properly sentenced on all sixty counts to five years' imprisonment, last three being suspended, and $30,000 in fines - (2) section 986 which prohibits &quot;book-making&quot; lists number of different acts all relating thereto but each constituting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  separate misdemeanor - (3) information here charges one conspiracy to violate said section and fifty-nine separate violations thereof - (4) sentence not violative of State Constitution; statutes (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 279; Penal Law, &sect; 2190) when read together provide that number of related offenses may be covered by same information and, for each count on which defendant is found guilty, that he may receive separate and cumulated sentence; defendant's rights not invaded and constitutional jurisdiction of special sessions not enlarged by allowing such sentence under one, rather than under sixty, informations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In a court of Special Sessions of the City of New York defendant pleaded guilty to each of sixty counts of an information.  The first count charged a conspiracy to violate a statute which prohibited &quot;book-making&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 986) while each of the following fifty-nine counts alleged a specific violation of said section.  Defendant was thereafter properly sentenced on each of the first two counts to imprisonment for one year in a penitentiary and a $500 fine, the total sentence on all sixty counts being five years' imprisonment, with the last three years thereof suspended, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and $30,000 in fines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 986 is a long statute which makes guilty of a misdemeanor a person who is guilty of any one of a number of different kinds of activities and acts.  Defendant would construe the section as if it merely prohibited the engaging in book-making and as if all the rest of the statutory language were merely explanatory of what the Legislature meant thereby.  The statute, however, is rather a listing of a number of different kinds of acts or conduct, all of them relating to &quot;book-making&quot; but each separately made a misdemeanor. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a long period of federal rent regulation, the federal government passed an act that permitted the states to take over rent control within their boundaries. New York responded by enacting a law that stated that where the federal maximum rent differed from the local maximum rent, the latter prevailed. By reason of an unusual set of circumstances, the federal maximum on a particular apartment was lower than the local maximum. The state rent administrator fixed the rent at the lower federal maximum pursuant to a regulation that stated that the lower of the two applied. The landlord filed a protest with the State Rent Commission, which rejected it. The landlord then filed an Article 78 proceeding in the trial court. Both the trial court and the appellate division affirmed. The landlord appealed. The court affirmed. The court agreed that the statute, on its face, made no provision for when the local maximum rent exceeded the federal maximum. However, the court found that the legislature's intent in having enacted the statute was that the lower maximum should have applied. The court held that the legislature's intent prevailed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  When Federal control of residential rents in New York State was terminated (pursuant to Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amd.; U.S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect;&sect; 1893, 1894) the State Emergency Housing Rent Control Law (L. 1950, ch. 250, &sect; 4, subd. 1, par. [a] ) stated that the State Housing Rent Commission &quot;shall establish maximum rents * * * which shall be the same as those prescribed on March first, nineteen hundred fifty, pursuant to the federal housing and rent act * * * or local laws specified in chapter one of the laws of nineteen hundred fifty.  Where there were different maximum rentals prescribed pursuant to such laws on March first, nineteen hundred fifty, the maximum rental established hereunder shall be the same as that prescribed pursuant to the local laws&quot;.  One of such local laws (&quot;Sharkey Law&quot;, Local Laws, 1949, No. 73 of City of New York; ratified by L. 1950, ch. 1) undertook to forbid the collection of apartment rent increases in New York&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City granted by the Federal authorities after March 1, 1949, and to that extent had been held unconstitutional during Federal control (in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Teeval Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Stern</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 301 N.Y. 346). When the State took over rent control, its legislative act stated ( &sect; 14) that local laws were referred to therein solely for purposes of identification and that any invalidity of such local laws should have no effect on their use as points of reference.  The Legislature also stated ( &sect; 13-a, subd. 1) that it was acting to prevent tenants from being subjected to increases ordered by Federal law.  The intent of the Legislature was correctly and validly expressed by the State Rent Commission in a regulation (&sect; 21, subd. 1, eff. May 1, 1950) which provided that maximum rents prescribed by New York City local law should prevail only if lower than the Federally prescribed maximum on March 1, 1950.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In 1951 it was called to the Legislature's attention that its 1950 act, taken at its face could mean that the local law maximum was to prevail even in the very unusual cases (such as petitioner's case here) where it was higher than the Federal maximum. The Legislature was reminded that the Governor in signing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the 1950 bill had stated that it fixed rents at the Federal or local level &quot;whichever is lower&quot; and that the Attorney-General had rendered a similar opinion.  Thereupon the Legislature amended the 1950 act (by L. 1951, ch. 36) so as to show that locally prescribed maximum rents were not to prevail when higher than the Federal, and that &quot;It is the intent of the legislature by this act to clarify the provisions of&quot; the 1950 act.  Such a subsequent clarification and construction by the Legislature is entitled to great weight, and in this case avoids an unexpected result.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the orders confirming the determinations by the commission and the private corporation, which denied the owner's application for a license for two consecutive years. The court held that the delegation by the legislature of its licensing power to the private corporation was such an abdication as to be patently an unconstitutional relinquishment of legislative power in violation of N.Y.

It also was unconstitutional as a delegation of the power to &quot;fix&quot; the rates of taxes on owners, trainers, and jockeys, and therefore also to fix the taxing policy of the state.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Tax Law ( &sect; 187, as rewritten by L. 1937, ch. 530) provides that &quot;every&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  domestic life insurance corporation * * * shall, for the privilege of exercising corporate franchises * * * pay a tax of one and three-fourths per centum on all gross direct premiums * * * received in cash or otherwise on risks resident in this state&quot; (subd. 2).  It further provides that &quot;In ascertaining the amount of direct premiums * * * there shall be first determined the amount of total gross premiums * * * on all policies * * * insurance and reinsurance executed, issued or delivered on property or risks located or resident in this state, including premiums for reinsurance assumed, and also including premiums written, procured or received in this state on business which cannot specifically be allocated or apportioned and reported as taxable premiums on business of any other state or states.&quot; (Subd. 5.) Under the latter provisions, petitioner (a domestic life insurance corporation authorized by all but fifteen of the States to do business therein, and which pays to such authorizing States franchise taxes based on premiums on the lives of insured residents) must pay a tax on premiums which it received on the lives of residents of the fifteen States where it had not been authorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to do business and on which it had not paid taxes to any State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  It is settled by decisions of the United States Supreme Court that an insurance corporation like petitioner does not, merely by accepting premiums on the lives of residents of fifteen States where it has not been authorized to do business, transact such a business there as is taxable by those States.  Policyholders in such States pay their premiums, after the initial payment, either to petitioner's home office in New York or to an agent in a nearby State where petitioner is authorized to do business and said agents there deposit the premiums in bank accounts in petitioner's name, withdrawable only by petitioner.  From time to time petitioner draws checks on such out-of-State bank accounts and thereby withdraws the premiums to New York.  None of the authorizing States has attempted to tax those premiums and it is not clear whether they can.  Those premiums are &quot;received in this state&quot; by petitioner, and are reasonably and peculiarly attributable to its New York franchise, and are taxable to petitioner by New York &quot;for the privilege of exercising corporate franchises&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  In this State, domestic and foreign insurance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporations are taxed under provisions of the Tax Law and the Insurance Law.Such taxing statutes are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">in pari materia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and must therefore be read together and applied harmoniously.  The corresponding provision of the Insurance Law ( &sect; 550, subd. 2, as recodified and clarified in 1939 without intended change of substance from &sect; 34, which had been rewritten together with Tax Law, &sect; 187, as part of L. 1937, ch. 530) states that &quot;all such premiums * * * shall be deemed written on property or risks located or resident in this state&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Petitioner is a domestic, not a foreign, insurance corporation, and is, therefore, without standing to assert that the Tax Law provision as applied to a foreign insurance corporation might violate the due process clause of the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The tax is not an ad valorem tax on intangible personal property.  (N.Y. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 3.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The tax is not on the importation of the money into New York as though it were an article of interstate commerce. [See U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8.] Rather the tax is on the privilege of exercising a corporate franchise granted by New York and is measured by the premiums reasonably attributable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the exercise of that franchise. The tax is exactly the same as to domestic and foreign insurers. No question of multiple taxation, which might be conceived as a potential burden upon interstate commerce, can arise, because the statute by its own terms applies only where such premiums are not otherwise taxed anywhere.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  In any event, Congress, after investigating the effect of the commerce clause, has declared &quot;that silence on [its] part * * * shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business [insurance] by the several States.&quot; (U.S. Code, tit. 15, &sect; 1011; see, also, &sect; 1012.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  However, the Tax Law ( &sect; 187, subd. 5) does not tax reinsurance premiums which are received in this State by a domestic insurance corporation from another insurance corporation which is not authorized to do business here where the person originally insured by such other corporation is not a resident of this State.  Reinsurance premiums are taxed only &quot;on property or risks located or resident in this state&quot; (subd. 5) which, as to life insurance companies, can only mean &quot;risks * * * resident in this state&quot;.  In its context, ordinary meaning, and common&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  understanding in the insurance world, that means the residence of the insured person, not the place of contract of the reinsuring corporation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  This interpretation of the Tax Law ( &sect; 187, subd. 5) as to reinsurance premiums was adopted by the Legislature in 1939, when it recodified corresponding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">in pari materia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tax provisions which it had written in 1937 in the Insurance Law ( &sect; 34).  The provision as to premimus &quot;allocated or apportioned and reported as taxable premiums of any other state or states&quot; is now in a separate place and applies only to &quot;direct premiums&quot; (Insurance Law, &sect; 550, subd. 2).  Alien insurance corporations are taxed on reinsurance premiums only &quot;to the extent that the same covers property or risks located or resident in this state&quot; ( &sect; 552, subd. 4).  It is unlikely that the Legislature intended to discriminate in favor of alien insurers and against domestic insurers; rather the statutory provisions should be read together.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner appealed from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed the dismissal of his complaint challenging the validity of two amendments to the zoning ordinance of defendant village and seeking to enjoin defendant property owner from constructing multiple dwellings on her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Some years ago, the village enacted a General Zoning Ordinance dividing the village into seven districts or zones for single family dwellings, two-family dwellings, multiple dwellings and apartment houses, three business districts and an industrial zone. Plaintiff, who owned a residence on a six-acre plot, brought an action to have two subsequent zoning amendments declared invalid and to enjoin defendant property owner from constructing multiple dwellings on her property. The appellate court adjudged the amendments valid and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. The court found that, viewing the rezoning amendments in the present case in the light of the area involved and the present and reasonably foreseeable needs of the community, the conclusion was inescapable that what was done not only accorded with sound zoning principles, not only complied with every requirement of law, but was accomplished in a proper, careful, and reasonable manner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - zoning - (1) village board of trustees in 1947 amended zoning ordinance by creating new &quot;Residence B-B&quot; zone for garden apartments and for one- and two-family dwellings, such zone to be limited to ten-acre plots and to be fixed by later amendment of zoning map; defendant with ten and one-half acre plot later applied for creation of new &quot;Residence B-B&quot; zone and, by second amendment of ordinance, property was placed in such zone; in action to have both amendments declared invalid and erection of apartments enjoined, complaint dismissed - (2) village board may amend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  zoning ordinance to promote general welfare and its judgment therein is conclusive unless shown to be arbitrary as to which burden of proof rests on objecting party - (3) board had choice of methods of accomplishing zoning aim to promote garden apartments; necessity for separate legislative authorization for each project presents no obstacle - (4) restriction of such zone to plots of ten acres or more not unfair; board's grant or refusal to zone any such plot subject to review by courts - (5) amendments here not illegal as &quot;spot zoning&quot; since they gave each owner of ten acres identical rights and were not for benefit of particular owner alone - (6) amendments not device for creating variance; issue as to property zoned not question of hardship but desirability of location for garden apartments - (7) 1947 amendment not invalid for failure to set boundaries or make proper changes on zoning map - (8) amendments not invalid because board employed two steps to accomplish what it could have covered in one.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Years after enacting a general zoning ordinance dividing a village into seven zones including Residence &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; zones for single family, two-family, and multiple family&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dwellings respectively, as well as business and industrial zones, the board of trustees, by ordinance enacted in 1947, created a new class of zone to be called &quot;Residence B-B&quot; in which (besides one- and two-family dwellings) buildings for multiple occupancy of fifteen or fewer families were permitted - the boundaries thereof to be fixed by subsequent appropriate amendment of the building zone map. A minimum of ten acres of land for such zone was required by the ordinance. A year and a half after the 1947 enactment one of defendants sought to have her property, consisting of ten and one-half acres in a Residence A district, placed in the new classification and several months later, after approval by the village planning board, the board of trustees passed another ordinance which provided that such a district should be applied to her property and the official building zone map amended accordingly.  In this action brought by a nearby property owner to have the amendments declared invalid and to enjoin said defendant from constructing multiple dwellings on her property, the complaint was properly dismissed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Persons who own property in a particular zone enjoy no eternal vested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right to that classification if the public interest demands otherwise and a village may amend its basic zoning ordinance in such a way as reasonably to promote the general welfare. Decision as to how a community shall be zoned or rezoned and as to how various properties shall be classified or reclassified rests with the local legislative body and its judgment is conclusive unless shown to be arbitrary by one who so asserts it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Considering the zoning aim of the board of trustees of furnishing additional housing facilities, attracting business to the community and lightening the tax load of the small home owner, a choice of methods lay with the board.  It could either amend the general zoning ordinance so as to (1) permit garden apartments on any plot of ten acres or more in Residence A and B zones, or (2) invite, as it did here, owners of ten or more acres who might wish to build garden apartments on their properties to apply for a &quot;Residence B-B&quot; classification. The necessity of separate legislative authorization for each project presents no obstacle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  A requirement that the applicant own a plot of at least ten acres was not unfair to other owners.  Some definite acreage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had to be chosen and, so far as appears, the choice of ten acres as a minimum plot was well within the range of an unassailable legislative judgment.  The owner of a ten-acre plot is not entitled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ipso facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the new classification. It still remains for the board, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, to decide whether a particular application shall be granted or denied and recourse may be had to the courts to correct an arbitrary or capricious determination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  &quot;Spot zoning&quot; - defined as the process of singling out a small parcel of land for a use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area for the benefit of the owner of such property and to the detriment of other owners - is the very antithesis of planned zoning. An ordinance enacted in accordance with a comprehensive zoning plan is not illegal &quot;spot zoning&quot; even though it singles out and affects but one small plot, or creates in the center of a large zone small areas devoted to a different use.  In this instance the amendment of 1947 applied to the entire territory of the village and gave each owner of ten or more acres identical rights.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  There is no basis for an argument that what&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was done constituted a device for creating a variance. The board of trustees followed approved procedure by changing the general zoning ordinance itself and, when called on to consider the reclassification of defendant's property, it was concerned not with any issue of hardship but only whether the property constituted a desirable location for a garden apartment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  There was no need that the 1947 amendment should fix boundaries for the new district or make changes in the building zone map for until both conditions are met no new zone actually comes into being and no property is affected.  The amendment was merely the first step and provided for further action which, when taken in 1948, fixed the boundaries of the zone and amended the map accordingly.  Read together, the amendments fully complied with the requirements of the Village Law and properly accomplished a rezoning of village property.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  Had the board simply amended the general zoning ordinance so as to permit property in Residence A and B zones to be used for garden apartments, provided they were built on ten-acre plots, there would be no doubt as to the propriety of the procedure despite the same uncertainty as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the location of the various types of structures.  Therefore to strike down the ordinances in question merely because the board employed two steps to accomplish what usually is done in one would be to exalt form over substance.  </SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court affirmed the convictions. On further review, the court also upheld the convictions. In reaching its decision, the court held that &sect; 2147 did not impinge upon religious freedom because it was not a law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Also, the court determined that &sect; 2147 did not deny the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment by reason of being discriminatory class legislation.

The court rejected defendants' claim that the statute had been consistently enforced discriminatorily in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. According to the court, the offer of proof was not an offer to show a pattern of discrimination consciously practiced; it merely indicated some nonenforcement as to certain other business, many of which were allowed to remain open for the sale of permitted commodities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - sale of food on Sunday - (1) section 2144 of Penal Law exempting from prosecution for Sunday work and labor persons observing another Sabbath not to be read into section 2147 dealing with &quot;public selling&quot; on Sunday; conviction for sale of food on Sunday in violation of section 2147 of Penal Law, affirmed - (2) section 2147 not unconstitutional as infringement on religious freedom; Sunday&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  laws have long recognized necessity of setting apart day of rest for physical and moral welfare of individual members of community - (3) section 2147, as asserted discriminatory class legislation, does not deny equal protection of laws - (4) claim that statute has been enforced in discriminatory manner in violation of equal protection clause without merit - (5) plea that statute imposes hardship should be addressed to Legislature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 2144 of the Penal Law, which exempts from prosecution for work or labor on Sunday persons observing as a Sabbath another day of the week, may not be read into section 2147 dealing with &quot;public selling * * * upon Sunday&quot;.  For almost three quarters of a century the exemption clause has been interpreted as referring only to laboring or working and as excluding selling. Accordingly, a judgment convicting defendants of the crime of having publicly sold and offered for sale uncooked meats on a Sunday in violation of section 2147 of the Penal Law should be affirmed where the defense is the invalidity of said section or its discriminatory application.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 2147 is not unconstitutional because of infringement upon religious freedom. It&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  works no restriction upon the exercise of religion according to the dictates of one's conscience nor does it in any way enforce or prohibit religion.  Although the so-called Sunday laws may have had a religious origin, our statute has also recognized that the first day of the week by general consent is set apart &quot;for rest&quot;, in accord with the general experience of mankind that it is wise and necessary to set apart such a day for the physical and moral welfare of members of the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 2147 does not deny the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment by reason of being discriminatory class legislation. The statutory scheme is that of a general prohibition against specified activities on Sunday with some exceptions, many of which emphasize the day as one for rest, play, relaxation and recreation rather than merely a religious Sabbath.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  A claim that the statute has been consistently enforced discriminatorily in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and section 11 of article I of the State Constitution is without merit.  The proof offered merely indicated some nonenforcement as to certain other businesses many of which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were allowed to remain open for the sale of permitted commodities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  A plea that a statute imposes inconvenience or hardship upon a litigant should be addressed to the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff husband and defendant newspaper both appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the supreme court's denial of the newspaper's motion for dismissal of the libel action and the denial of the husband's motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband and his wife were involved in a separation action. The newspaper published in several editions of its papers an article concerning their separation action. Subsequently, the husband filed a libel action against the newspaper, claiming that it was in violation of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 278. The newspaper claimed that the article was privileged under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 337. On review, the court affirmed the denial of both motions. Denial of the husband's motion for judgment on the pleadings was proper because the newspaper had raised an issue of material fact, i.e., whether the husband had lost income as a result of the published article. On the newspaper's motion to dismiss, the court found that the article fell far short of the standard for privilege under Rule 337 because it was neither true nor fair. The article failed to make any mention of the fact that the charges were made as part of a motion, which had been withdrawn. Further, the article made a false assertion as to when the wife made her charges against the husband. Thus, the privilege declared by Rule 337 did not attach to the article.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a libel action, the court affirmed the orders that denied both the newspaper's motion for dismissal and the husband's motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libel and slander - privilege - fair and true newspaper report of judicial proceedings - (1) since answer contains denial (that plaintiff lost position because of defendant's newspaper publication) which raises issue of fact, plaintiff's motion for judgment addressed to entire answer must be denied - (2) defense of new matter is deemed controverted (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 243) and ordinarily not to be considered on defendant's motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for judgment on pleadings, but motion here is based also on admissions by plaintiff of genuineness of papers annexed to defense of privilege, consisting of plaintiff's wife's motion papers for temporary alimony in separation action against plaintiff and of order withdrawing her motion - (3) answer pleads defense of &quot;fair and true report of * * * judicial * * * proceedings&quot;; article not full, fair and impartial, and omitted fact that wife had withdrawn her motion; publication not privileged; order denying defendant's motion for judgment on pleadings affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A motion by a plaintiff for judgment on the pleadings, when addressed to the entire answer, will be denied irrespective of the merits of an affirmative defense, if the answer contains a denial which raises an issue of fact. In this libel action defendant's answer denies the allegation that plaintiff lost his employment because of defendant's publication.  Hence, the order denying plaintiff's motion should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  A defense consisting of new matter is deemed controverted (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 243) and ordinarily will not be considered on a defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings.  Nevertheless, the question&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  here presented is whether the defense of privilege pleaded by defendant newspaper is valid, because defendant's motion for judgment is made on the pleadings and on admissions which plaintiff made pursuant to section 322 of the Civil Practice Act. Those admissions establish the genuineness of the papers annexed to and made part of the plea of privilege in the answer - that is, copies of motion papers for temporary alimony filed by plaintiff's wife in her separation action against plaintiff and of an order under which her motion was withdrawn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The answer pleads that defendant's article was a &quot;fair and true report of * * * judicial * * * proceedings&quot; (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 337).  The article, in part, reads: &quot;That double-dealing husbands are a dime a dozen * * * .  But [plaintiff], $27,000-a-year treasurer of * * * Corp., does not fool around on so small a scale, his wife, Grace, charged yesterday in Supreme Court, Manhattan.  Bob, said Grace, is a triple-dealer. By this [she] explained in a suit for separation, she means that [he] not only has been double-dealing her with a lady in his employ but also is cheating on the co-respondent.&quot; No mention was made that such charges&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (which the article falsely said were made &quot;yesterday&quot;) were made as part of a motion which had theretofore been withdrawn. The article was neither true nor fair and consequently not privileged under section 337 of the Civil Practice Act. Accordingly, the order denying defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

The appeals court entered judgment finding that the transactions did not violate the law. The supreme court reversed the judgment. According to the court, when a consumer was accorded a discount, the consumer in reality paid that much less for the article that he purchased, and this was none the less true because the return was by way of merchandise rather than coin, which might purchase merchandise. The court held that when seller sold manufacturer's products at fair trade prices, and as a part of the same transaction gave their customers cash register receipts having a redemption value of two and a half percent of such fair trade prices, they, in effect, sold manufacturer's products at two and a half percent less than the prices fixed. The court concluded that such behavior was violative of the act and that manufacturer was entitled to an injunction upon proof that its products were willfully sold at a lesser price.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A manufacturer of drug and cosmetic products expended large sums of money in advertising and selling its products under distinctive trade-marks and established a valuable reputation and good will for them.  To protect that good will it established minimum retail prices for its products and fulfilled all the requisites to their trading pursuant to the Fair Trade Law (General Business Law, &sect; 369-a through&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &sect; 369-e).  In this action such manufacturer seeks to restrain defendants, who operate a retail drugstore where plaintiff's products are sold, from selling such products at less than the prices fixed in fair trade contracts made with dealers.  Defendants had no fair trade contract with plaintiff but knew that plaintiff's products were fair-traded. Some years prior to passage of the Fair Trade Law, defendants originated a merchandising plan under which their customers could redeem cash register receipts in specified articles of merchandise.Later, such cash register receipts were redeemable in trade from defendants' merchandise, whether fair-traded or not, at the rate of 2 1/2% of cash purchases, when they aggregated $10 or more.  Later, defendants and fourteen other merchants (not druggists) formed a &quot;Lynbrook Dividend Club&quot; plan, under which each store redeemed its own receipts as well as those issued by any other member store, and monthly adjustments were made.  The customer, upon accumulating $10 worth of the receipts from any of these stores, could redeem them in any of the stores for a great variety of merchandise, whether fair-traded or not, at a value of twenty-five cents for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  each $10 of receipts.  Such plan, &quot;whether the person so * * * selling is or is not a party to such [fair trade] contract, is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of any person damaged thereby.&quot; (General Business Law, &sect; 369-b.) Special Term properly enjoined defendants from advertising or selling plaintiff's trade-marked products at prices less than those fixed by plaintiff in contracts made under the Fair Trade Law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Congress has removed from the interdict of the Federal anti-trust and unfair competition laws resale price maintenance agreements which are valid in the State of resale.  (U.S. Code, tit. 15, &sect; 1.) In any event, the validity of the State statutes as against constitutional objections (U.S. Const., 14th Amendt.; N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6) is founded upon the protection thus afforded the manufacturer as the owner of the brand name and good will of trade-marked merchandise. Our Fair Trade Law constitutes a valid exercise of police power to protect such good will against assault and it is a lawful limitation upon freedom of contract to cut prices.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Defendants' plan constitutes price cutting. The Fair Trade Law makes no exception for, and does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not sanction, such discounts. (Cf. General Business Law, &sect; 369-a, subds. 2, 3; &sect; 369-c; Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 101-b, subd. 2, par. [b]. ) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Considered as a method of advertising, defendants' scheme must be differentiated from types of service such as free parking, self-service, care of infants, entertainment, free delivery and the like, which have no direct relation to the article purchased or the price paid and which are too remote from the pricing element to come within the statute's prohibition.  Under defendants' plan, the benefit to the customer is directly, proportionately, inseparably and specifically related to the article purchased and its price.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The Fair Trade Law provides that cutting prices of fair trade articles is unfair competition. The base of unfair competition is an assault upon good will.  Such injury to good will, actual or threatened, may be enjoined, even though proof of specific money damages is not supplied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The weight of the evidence lies with the finding of Special Term that defendants' practice does constitute price cutting, and the Appellate Division was in error on the law when it held that such practice is not within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the prohibition of our Fair Trade Law. The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and that of Special Term affirmed.  [Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 605.] </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In 1917 the Legislature added to the Education Law present section 3021 directing the removal of superintendents, teachers and employees in the public schools for treasonable or seditious acts or utterances. In 1939 there was added to the Civil Service Law section 12-a which provided, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that no one should be appointed to or continued as superintendent or teacher in a public school who advocated or taught that the Government of the United States or of any State or political subdivision should be overthrown by force or who organized or became a member of any society or group teaching such doctrine.  One so dismissed or declared ineligible was entitled to a hearing on such charges and the burden of sustaining the order by a fair preponderance of credible evidence was on the person making the order.  Ten years later by section 1 of chapter 360 of the Laws of 1949, the Legislature found that members of subversive groups and &quot;particularly of the communist party&quot; had infiltrated into the public schools&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  despite the statutes designed to prevent such action and that members of such groups advocating violent overthrow of the Government used their position to advocate and teach subversive doctrines and, further, that to avert such infiltration the Board of Regents should be directed to meet the menace by affirmative action.  To meet such conditions section 3022 (known as the Feinberg Law) was enacted by said chapter.  It provides that the Board of Regents shall adopt and enforce rules and regulations for the disqualification of superintendents, teachers or employees in the public schools who violate the provisions of section 3021 of the Education Law or who are ineligible on any of the grounds set forth in section 12-a of the Civil Service Law. Subdivision 2 directs the Board of Regents to list the organizations which it finds to be subversive for teaching the violent overthrow of Government and provides that it may utilize similar listings promulgated by any Federal agency and that it shall provide that membership in any such organization shall constitute prima facie evidence of disqualification for appointment to or retention in any position in the public schools. Judgments and orders&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upholding the constitutionality of said section should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The Feinberg Law serves to implement section 12-a of the Civil Service Law in manner found by the Legislature to be expedient in view of the circumstances set forth in its preamble. It provides a basis of disqualification for employment by State or municipal agencies of personnel essential to a constitutional function of the State, the education of its children.  The judgment of the Legislature as expressed in the restrictive provisions of the statute bears a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose to safeguard the public school system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The freedoms of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution and those guaranteed by section 8 of article I of the State Constitution are not absolute and do not deprive the State of its primary right of self-preservation.  Those freedoms do not sanction unbridled license.  By enacting the Feinberg Law, the Legislature - acting within its province - has found and has declared that conditions - referred to in the preamble - did exist and required the adoption of statutory measures to protect public school children from subversive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  influences.  Whether the danger envisaged was &quot;clear and present&quot; is answered by the Legislature's factual finding that an infiltration of members of subversive groups into employment in the public schools has occurred and that the consequence thereof is that subversive propaganda can be disseminated among children of tender years and that members of such groups use their office to teach such doctrines.  The Feinberg Law is neither an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the police power nor does it unwarrantably infringe upon any constitutional right of free speech, assembly or association.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  It is contended that the statute is a bill of attainder violative of section 9 of article I of the Federal Constitution, in that its preamble states that members of subversive groups &quot;and particularly of the communist party&quot; have infiltrated into public employment in the public schools. The preamble, however, enacts nothing, contains no directive and, indeed, was not made part of the Education Law. Provision is made for a hearing to be afforded any organization as to which an inquiry shall be instituted and no punishment is inflicted on any organization which, after hearing, the board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall find advocates the overthrow of Government by force or unlawful means.  Any organization aggrieved by the board may, under the statute, bring a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  There is no lack of clarity in the operative clause of subdivision 2 of said section 3022 which directs the board to list organizations found to be subversive for teaching the overthrow of Government by force.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Under subdivision 2 no organization may be listed as subversive until after inquiry and appropriate hearing.  While knowingly holding membership in such an organization shall constitute &quot;prima facie evidence of disqualification&quot; fortion disappears and thus the quoted phrase imports a hearing at which one who seeks appointment or retention is afforded an opportunity to present such evidence.  Once such contrary evidence has been received, the official who made the order has the burden of sustaining the validity thereof and provisions for review are prescribed by section 12-a of the Civil Service Law. Consequently, there is no question of procedural due process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  There is no restriction in the statute which exceeds the Legislature's constitutional power.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation, which owned a Russian Orthodox cathedral, filed suit against defendants, schismatics who occupied the cathedral, and sought to prove they were not the proper parties to administer the religious trust. The trial court dismissed the complaint after trial, and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church in North America held a sobor in 1924 at which it was determined that local administration was called for in light of the repression of the church in the Soviet Union. However, the schismatics, who were credentialed with a variant church that had some governmental support in the Soviet Union, had filed actions in New York to establish the validity of their appointments and had obtained an injunction to occupy the cathedral. They claimed that they were properly occupying the cathedral. The corporation claimed that the beneficial use of the cathedral properly belonged to the Russian church in America, which was forced to declare its administrative autonomy at the 1924 sobor. The court held that N.Y. Relig. Corp. Law &sect; 5 provided for denominational control and administration of church properties and temporalities, so that the corporation could not simply evict the schismatics. However, N.Y. Relig. Corp. Law &sect; 107 provided that every New York Russian Orthodox church was to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church in North America. Therefore, the lower courts erred in finding for the schismatics.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower courts' rulings in favor of the schismatics and directed judgment for the corporation, reinvesting the corporation and the autonomous metropolitan district that it represented with the possession and administration of the cathedral.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious corporations and associations - title to church property - constitutionality of legislative determination of beneficiaries for whom church property is held - (1) in ejectment action for possession of cathedral in New York of North American diocese of Russian Orthodox Church, wherein title was proved by plaintiff corporation which represents autonomous North American district created after Russian Government had subjugated central church authority, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgments of trial court and Appellate Division in favor of defendant bishop appointed by subjugated central church authority, reversed and judgment directed for plaintiff - (2) courts below could have found that autonomous North American district is proper trustee of cathedral for benefit of faithful of diocese - (3) article 5-C of Religious Corporations Law is construed as legislative determination that autonomous North American district of church is trustee of purposes for which cathedral was originally dedicated - (4) such legislative determination, as exception to general provision of section 5 of Religious Corporations Law for denominational control of church property, is constitutional; facts of subjugation of central church are deemed found by Legislature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In this ejectment action for possession of a building in New York City which, since 1905, has been the cathedral of the North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church, the defendants are the ruling bishop of the diocese appointed by the purported head of the church in Russia and a priest ordained by said bishop. Plaintiff, a New York religious corporation, has proved (1) that the church has been subjugated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Russian Government and has not had an independent existence in Russia since at least 1923, (2) that an American convention of the church in 1924 created an autonomous North American district under an archbishop who had been designated to rule the North American church by the last free act of the head of the church in Russia, (3) that most of the parishes adhere to such autonomous North American district, (4) that plaintiff corporation, composed of said archbishop and other members of such Russian Orthodox Church in North America, was created by a special act of the State Legislature (L. 1925, ch. 463, confirmed by L. 1945, ch. 817), (5) that plaintiff corporation has a deed from the religious corporation in whose name the title to the cathedral was originally held, executed in 1925 by the Russian Consul General as one of the two incorporators of the grantor but not executed by the Ambassador as the other incorporator of the grantor, and that such defect was cured by an act of the Legislature (L. 1942, ch. 206).  Judgments of the trial court and the Appellate Division, dismissing the complaint, should be reversed and judgment directed for plaintiff.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Since 1875, the Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has provided for the denominational control of church properties (Religious Corporations Law, &sect; 5).  The corporate owner thus holds the property in a trust dedicated to the religious uses of the church. On the evidence, the courts below would have been warranted in exercising the discretionary power of the Supreme Court over the conduct of trustees and in determining that the leaders of the North American autonomous district are the trustees who may be relied upon to carry out the purposes of this religious trust for the benefit of the faithful for whose use the cathedral was originally dedicated. The courts below failed to exercise that discretion, because they believed that the appointees of the nominal church authorities in Russia were legally entitled to possession of the cathedral. This was error.  The determinative issue in this case is whether the central organization of the church in Russia is a free religious body or a mere organ of an antireligious government.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  By article 5-C of the Religious Corporations Law (added by L. 1945, ch. 693; amd. by L. 1948, ch. 711) the Legislature has conclusively determined, in effect, that the autonomous North American district (the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Russian Church in America&quot;) is the trustee which may be relied upon to carry out more effectively and faithfully the purposes of this religious trust.  This is the only construction which gives effect to all the language of sections 105 and 107 of article 5-C.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The general rule of section 5 of the Religious Corporations Law is that the trustees of a religious corporation must administer the temporalities in accordance with the discipline of the ecclesiastical body to which the corporation is subject, irrespective of the wishes of the majority of the local congregation. But the Legislature may constitutionally modify this rule in a case where its literal enforcement would be unreasonable.  The Legislature, in the exercise of its extensive power to act for the common welfare, may find as a fact that a situation has arisen of such novelty that existing law is incapable of performing its avowed function - preservation of religious temporalities for the use of their original and accustomed beneficiaries.  In such case, there can be no constitutional objection to a legislative tracing and identification (as in article 5-C) of the authentic group entitled to the administration of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such properties.  The facts as to the subjugation of the church in Russia must be deemed to have been found by and to have been within the knowledge of the Legislature when it decided to act in 1945 and 1948.  Even assuming that courts are prevented from recognizing these facts, the Legislature is not under such an unrealistic handicap.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant brokerage firm appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's order denying the brokerage firm's motion for summary judgment dismissing the action brought by plaintiff, the administrator of the client's estate, to recover the value of the client's securities that were sold by the brokerage firm without authorization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The client, who was a resident of the Netherlands, entered into an agreement with the brokerage firm whereby the brokerage firm agreed to buy and sell securities for the client. Subsequently, the brokerage firm without the client's knowledge or authorization sold the major portion of the securities held for the client's account. Thereafter, World War II began, and the client was arrested and deported to a concentration camp where he died. After the war, the administrator filed the action on the client's behalf to recover the value of the securities sold without authorization. The brokerage firm alleged that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court denied the brokerage firm's motion to dismiss, and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court also affirmed, holding that the administrator's action commenced the period permitted by the statute of limitations. The court concluded that the Civil Practice Act was applicable in favor of the client, who was a citizen of an enemy-occupied country, and that &sect;&sect; 27 and 28 of the Civil Practice Act applied to the administrator's cause of action and effectively tolled the statute of limitations during the war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  On April 30, 1940, pursuant to an agreement made by decedent, a citizen and resident of the Netherlands, and defendant, a New York broker, for the purchase and sale of securities, defendant held for decedent's account securities subject to an indebtedness of about $24,000.  On the following May 10th, the Netherlands was invaded by the German Army and during the occupation, decedent was arrested and deported to a concentration camp. It has been established that he died in May, 1944.  Between May 14 and May 22, 1940, defendant, contrary to law and in violation of the agreement, sold the major portion of the securities and reduced decedent's indebtedness thereby.  In October, 1946, plaintiff was appointed ancillary administrator of decedent's estate and in 1948 brought this action to recover the value of the securities with dividends and interest.  Defendant asserts that since the action accrued not later than May 22, 1940, it was barred by the Statute of Limitations. Summary judgment dismissing the complaint was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  After leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals had been granted and on April 17, 1950, the Civil Practice Act was amended by adding a new&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  section 28-a (L. 1950, ch. 759, &sect; 1) which provided that if one entitled to maintain an action was a resident or sojourner in a foreign country with which this country or its allies were at war between September 1, 1939, and August 14, 1945, or any territory occupied by the Government of such foreign country, the period during which such territory was so occupied should not be part of the time limited for commencing an action provided that the period for commencement should not extend more than one year from the date of the statute.  The same chapter further provided that, except in cases of actions involving title to property, the new section should apply to causes of action theretofore accrued and barred.  In a case such as this, the Court of Appeals will apply the law as it exists at the time of its decision.  The new section applies to decedent who was a resident or sojourner in a territory occupied as described.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Legislature may constitutionally revive a personal cause of action where the circumstances are exceptional and such as to satisfy the court that serious injustice would result to plaintiffs not guilty of any fault if the intention of the Legislature were not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  effectuated.  The court is free to approach each revival statute on its individual merits in the light of its own peculiar circumstances and setting.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Robinson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 238 N.Y. 271, followed.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  In this case a situation is presented in which revival - even if considered an extreme exercise of the legislative power - is entirely proper.  World War II resulted in a complete and thorough disruption of communication by those on the mainland of Europe with the outside world.  Aside from the question of legal disability to sue, the citizens and residents of occupied territory were, during such occupation, under a practical and total inability to commence actions in the courts of this State to protect and effectuate their rights.  To permit the Statute of Limitations to run against their claims during the continuance of such inability would not accord with elementary notions of justice and fairness.  The facts of the instant case illustrate the type of injustice this legislation was intended to remedy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Chapter 759 of the Laws of 1950 is constitutional and under the terms thereof the period of decedent's residence or sojourn in territory occupied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Germans is not a part of the time limited for commencing the action.  Deducting that period from the normal time, the action was brought within six years from the time it accrued. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant nonprofit corporation sought review of a judgment from Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), which affirmed an order denying the nonprofit corporation's application for a mandamus order directing respondent building superintendent to issue a building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nonprofit corporation sought an order in mandamus that would direct the building superintendent to issue a building permit. The lower court affirmed the dismissal of the nonprofit corporation's case and the denial of the building permit. On appeal, the nonprofit corporation challenged the constitutionality of the zoning amendment upon the ground that it was arbitrary, unreasonable, and confiscatory in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court reversed the lower court judgment because it found that the amendment to the zoning ordinance was invalid. The provisions of the zoning amendment withdrew the unrestricted permission to use property in the residential district for educational purposes, but authorized permission with the consent of adjoining property owners. The court held that the amendment was invalid because the nonprofit corporation and building superintendent would both be powerless in that adjoining property owners could prevent authorized uses of property. The court concluded that the zoning amendment was invalid because it violated due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - municipal corporations - zoning - school buildings - (1) amendment to village zoning ordinance which provided for granting of variance in residence district by board of appeals to permit erection of building for educational purpose upon filing of consent of 80% of owners of adjoining property, invalid; no triable issue of fact presented; application for order directing issuance of permit for erection of school buildings granted - (2) effect of ordinance would be that adjoining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property owners could determine petitioner's use of property - (3) no standards or guides for exercise of discretion of board of appeals provided - (4) not necessary to seek relief under invalid amendment or to show hardship under section 179-b of Village Law - (5) provisions of prior ordinance permitting erection of buildings for education purposes restored. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A village, in which an educational institution had continuously owned and operated its property as a school and campus site for about forty years, in 1938 enacted a zoning ordinance which placed the school's property in a residence district where educational buildings were expressly permitted (art. 3, &sect; 1, subd. [b] ).  In 1941 this provision was repealed and the zoning ordinance amended to provide (art. 12, &sect; 7, subd. [f] ) that a variance might be permitted in a residence district by the board of appeals for the erection or alteration of a building for educational purposes provided consents were filed of 80% of the owners of property fronting on the streets enclosing the block within which lies the property intended for such use.  This amendment is invalid. It violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Federal Constitution and section 6 of article I of the State Constitution.  Since no triable issue of fact is presented, petitioner's application for an order directing that a building permit for the erection of additional school buildings be issued should be granted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The effect of the amendment would be that school buildings could not be erected as a matter of right in any of the residence districts, comprising 97% of the village territory.  The remaining 3% is not only not available for such use but would be impractical for it.  A small number of adjoining property owners could thus determine, by dissent or indifference, and with no guides or standards, the kind of use petitioner might make of its property.  Consent provisions may be proper when dealing with offensive uses of property, but an educational use furthers the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The ordinance is invalid also in that it provides no standards or guides for the exercise of the discretion of the board of appeals in approving or rejecting educational uses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Petitioner was not required to seek relief under the 1941 amendment, nor was it required to attempt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to show hardship under section 179-b of the Village Law. The restriction of the ordinance is an invasion of petitioner's property rights, and it need not seek as a matter of grace and special privilege what it should have as a matter of right. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The provisions of the 1938 ordinance permitting the erection of buildings for educational purposes are restored, insofar as petitioner's use is concerned, upon the determination that the amendment is invalid. There was no intention, in adding the amendment, to bar permits for educational buildings.  The permits were merely subjected to limitations, which are here declared to be invalid. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landlord appealed a decision from the Municipal Court of the City of New York (New York), granting defendant tenant's motion for an order dismissing the landlord's complaint for insufficiency in law, on the ground that both the Sharkey Law and the state rent control statute were constitutional and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The collection in the City of New York of any rent higher than that payable on March 1, 1949 was prohibited by the validated Sharkey Law for the period ending April 30, 1950, and for that beginning May 1, 1950, by the terms of the state rent control statute. In issue was whether the state rent control statute was invalid because thereby rents payable on and after May 1, 1950, in the city were rolled back to the March 1, 1949, levels. The court concluded that the state rent control statute was valid. Also in issue was whether the landlord was entitled to collect the arrears of rent for the period from October 1, 1949, to April 30, 1950, a period prior to the effective date of the state rent control statute. The Municipal Court of the City of New York had jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim for arrears of rent. Section 13-a of the state rent control statute attempted to abolish or at least to suspend that jurisdiction solely in respect of claims for arrears of rent that had accrued by operation of an act of Congress. The court found the legislature did not have the power to do so, thus the provisions of &sect; 13-a were wholly void. The landlord could claim the arrears.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed, without costs, the judgment below, and remitted the action to the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - landlord and tenant - rent regulation - appeal - (1) State Emergency Housing Rent Control Law (L. 1950, ch. 250), terminating Federal residential rent control as of May 1, 1950, and imposing State rent control, is constitutional - (2) Federal act expressed willingness of Congress to withdraw from field of rent control; State acted in exercise of police power reserved to States by Tenth Amendment of Federal Constitution - (3) State act need not closely follow pattern of Federal act - (4) State freezing of Federally controlled rents in New York City as of March 1, 1949, and elsewhere as of March 1, 1950, is justifiable classification - (5) Legislature enacted three rent control bills and Governor had legislative power to veto two and approve one (N.Y. Const., art. IV, &sect; 7) - (6) though emergency law may now and then compel owner to suffer loss, it is not arbitrary exercise of police power - (7) so much of New York City Local Law No. 73 of 1949 (as ratified by L. 1950, ch. 1) as forbade collection of rent increases granted by Federal Housing Expediter unless authorized by temporary city housing rent commission, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was void (U.S. Const., art. VI, &sect; 2) - (8) section 13-a of State rent control law, purporting to suspend jurisdiction of courts as to claims based on increases granted by Federal Housing Expediter, is likewise void - (9) but section 13-a is separable from rest of statute; landlords may maintain summary proceedings for nonpayment of arrears of rent consisting of increases granted by Federal Housing Expediter for period up to April 30, 1950, and may recover such increases - (10) where complaint of landlord seeking to recover such increases plus entire rent of May, 1950, was dismissed and landlord did not seek partial judgment for rolled-back amount of May rent, direct appeal lay to Court of Appeals but sole question was constitutionality of statute; hence, although dismissal reversed, no recovery may be had for rent of May, 1950 - (11) since Federal rent control in this State has been terminated, those appeals which involve only questions of conflict between local law and Federal act as to landlords' right to possession, are academic and must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The State Emergency Housing Rent Control Law (L. 1950, ch. 250) (1) terminated as of May 1, 1950, Federal rent control in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this State, (2) froze at the levels of March 1, 1949, residential rents in the city of New York that had theretofore been controlled either by the Federal acts or by New York City local laws, and (3) froze as of March 1, 1950, residential rents that elsewhere in the State had been controlled by the Federal acts.  These provisions are constitutional and valid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Congress had expressed its willingness to withdraw from the field of rent control in the States and to permit them to occupy that field.  (Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amd.; U.S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 1894, subd. [j], par. [1]. ) On the strength of that declaration, the Legislature of this State passed the rent control statute in the exercise of the inherent police power reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The State rent control statute (&sect; 1) indicates the dissatisfaction of the Legislature with some of the results of Federal rent control. The Legislature had reasons of its own for not following more closely than it did the pattern of the Federal system of rent control and, this being so, it is not for this court to say that the Legislature was bound to take&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a different course.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The freezing of rents in the city of New York as of one date (March 1, 1949) and elsewhere in the State as of another date (March 1, 1950) is not an arbitrary classification.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The Legislature did not delegate its powers when it enacted three different rent control bills, of which the Governor approved one and vetoed two.  In exercising his power to approve or veto legislation the Governor performs a legislative function (N.Y. Const., art. IV, &sect; 7).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  It cannot be said that the State rent control statute will deprive landlords of a fair return on their investment.  The State statute was enacted to meet a passing emergency. It does not contemplate a taking of the property of any landlord. Even though it may, now and then, compel an owner to operate his real property at a loss, the statute is not for that reason to be condemned as an arbitrary use of the police power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  So much of New York City Local Law No. 73 of 1949 (Administrative Code, &sect; U41-7.0, purportedly validated by L. 1950, ch. 1) as undertook to forbid collection of rent increases granted by the Federal Housing Expediter was void. It was not consistent and concurrent with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal act, but was rather an attempt to override the Federal rent-fixing formula.  It was in conflict with the supremacy clause of the Federal Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 2) which states: &quot;This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof * * * shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.&quot; In actions or summary proceedings based on nonpayment of such increases, it was, therefore, not necessary to allege compliance with the local law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  Section 13-a of the State rent control law (L. 1950, ch. 250), which attempts to abolish or at least to suspend the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of claims for arrears of rent consisting of rent increases in the city of New York granted by the Federal Housing Expediter after March 1, 1949, is void. Such arrears of rent have accrued by operation of an act of the Congress of the United States and the Federal law is supreme.  The question is not one of degree or of reasonableness of the State statute.  The power which the Legislature assumed to exercise in enacting section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  13-a does not exist.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  But the invalidity of section 13-a of the State rent control statute does not vitiate any other provision thereof.  Section 13-a has been plainly treated by the Legislature as a distinct and separable part of its statutory plan.  Landlords may therefore recover, and may maintain summary proceedings for nonpayment of arrears of rent consisting of increases granted by the Federal Housing Expediter for the period prior to the effective date of State rent control, May 1, 1950.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.  In those cases where landlords sought a judgment for both (a) the amounts of increases granted by the Federal Housing Expediter and unpaid by the tenants for the period up to April 30, 1950, and (b) the entire rent for May, 1950, dismissals by the Municipal Court should be reversed.  However, as to the amount of unpaid rent for May, 1950 (but without the Federal increase), recovery could have been had in the Municipal Court.The landlords were nevertheless content to have such complaints dismissed unless the tenants were to be held liable for the full sum demanded.  Thus, the landlords' appeals were rightly taken directly to the Court of Appeals, upon the ground that the only question&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  involved was the constitutionality of a State or local law; and, although the dismissals should be reversed, such landlords appellants can have no recovery of rent for the month of May, 1950.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.  Since Federal rent control in this State has been terminated, questions now presented upon reargument of the appeals in another action and in a summary proceeding - whether the Federal act was unconstitutionally interfered with by the requirements of New York City Local Law No. 73 of 1949 as to the eviction of tenants (a) where the Federal Housing Expediter had decontrolled an apartment in order to permit the landlord to subdivide it into smaller units, and (b) where the Federal Housing Expediter had authorized the landlord to institute proceedings to regain possession of an apartment for the immediate purpose of permanently withdrawing it from the rental market - have become academic, and accordingly those two appeals must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial District (New York) affirmed a filiation order of a trial court to the extent that it determined that the father was the father of the mother's child, reversed the order to the extent that it ordered the father to pay the mother's counsel fees, and modified the order by reducing child support payments. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the mother claimed that the appellate division erred in reversing the award of counsel fees. The father claimed that the award of counsel fees was properly reversed because there was no specific provision in the New York City Criminal Courts Act for the awarding of counsel fees in a paternity proceeding. He also alleged that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 120, which allowed for counsel fees, did not apply to a proceeding in New York City. The court noted that &sect;61(4) of the New York City Criminal Courts Act and N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 120 were identical except the words &quot;including counsel fees&quot; was inserted in the Domestic Relations Law whereas the Criminal Courts Act referred to &quot;expenses.&quot; The court held that the Domestic Relations Law was not by its provisions or otherwise, limited to any particular portion of the State. Further, the court held that it specifically vested jurisdiction over paternity proceedings pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 122(3), &sect; 135. Also, the court held that because a harmonious construction could be had of the Domestic Relations Law and the Criminal Courts Act, they were to be construed together.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the Sanitary Code of the City of New York had within that city the force and effect of state law.

Further, &sect; 33 made a confidential medical report open to inspection only for scientific purposes approved by the New York City Board of Health. The court found that no provision of the state sanitary code related to the city of New York and every provision of the state sanitary code applied to and was effective in all portions of the state except the city of New York unless stated otherwise pursuant to N.Y.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence - privileged communications - confidential medical report of cause of death - health - municipal corporations - statutory construction - (1) New York City Sanitary Code (&sect; 33), which provides for certificate of death from natural causes, validly further provides that separate confidential medical report is privileged communication&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not subject to subpoena - (2) application for warrant in aid of subpoena duces tecum to compel city health department to produce confidential medical report before workmen's compensation referee, properly denied - (3) whether reasons for enactment of section 33 of Sanitary Code outbalanced by reasons which might be urged against it is legislative question not to be reagitated in courts - (4) privileged communication under section 33 consistent with subpoena provisions of Workmen's Compensation Law ( &sect; 119) - (5) city itself not given access to confidential medical reports, since they are open to inspection only &quot;for scientific purposes approved by the Board of Health&quot; - (6) policy of section 33, adopted in 1938, tacitly approved by amendments of section 2-b of Public Health Law in 1946 and 1947.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A certificate of death filed with the department of health of the city of New York by a physician set forth the name and residence of the decedent, the time and place of death, that the decedent was a white man sixty-two years old who had been under medical care since December, 1946, and further certified that the &quot;death was not caused, directly or indirectly, by accident, homicide, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  suicide, acute or chronic poisoning, or in any suspicious or unusual manner, and that it was due to NATURAL CAUSES more fully described in the confidential medical report filed with the [city] Department of Health.&quot; The Sanitary Code of the city (&sect; 33) provides, as to deaths from natural causes, that a certificate of death and a separate &quot;confidential medical report&quot; shall be filed.  The section further provides that the latter report &quot;shall be deemed not a part of such certificate&quot; of death, but, on the contrary, &quot;shall be regarded and treated as a confidential and privileged communication, and shall not be subject to subpoena or open to inspection for any reason whatsoever, other than for scientific purposes approved by the [city] Board of Health.&quot; This provision is valid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The city department of health properly refused to produce the confidential medical report upon a subpoena duces tecum returnable before a workmen's compensation referee (Workmen's Compensation Law, &sect; 119) upon a claim for death benefits.  A warrant to compel its production was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Whether the reasons in favor of such a privileged communication in the city of New York, as created&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by section 33, outbalance the reasons that may be urged against it was a legislative question which has been settled by the authorities having jurisdiction.  The matter cannot be reagitated in the courts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 33 of the Sanitary Code is consistent with the subpoena provisions of section 119 of the Workmen's Compensation Law and does not conflict with subdivision b of section 558 of the New York City Charter which authorizes the board of health to (1) add to, amend or repeal the Sanitary Code, (2) publish additional provisions for security of life and health in the city, and (3) confer additional powers on the city department of health not inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the State.  Persons subpoenaed may assert against the compulsion of such process whatever privileges they enjoy under the common law or by statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Since the confidential medical reports are open to inspection only &quot;for scientific purposes approved by the Board of Health&quot;, it cannot be said that section 33 gives to the city, as an employer of labor, unequal and unrestricted access to such reports.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Under the Public Health Law ( &sect;&sect; 2-b, 4, 38, 394) the New York City Sanitary Code has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the effect of State law within the city.  Since section 33 was adopted in 1938, the Legislature has twice declared that no provision of the State Sanitary Code shall relate to the city of New York (Public Health Law, &sect; 2-b, as amd. by L. 1946, ch. 166, L. 1947, ch. 293).  This tacit statutory sanction of the policy of section 33 leaves no room for judicial consideration of any contrary policy.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landlords and appellee tenants were involved in a dispute over whether the landlords were entitled to a retroactive rent increase granted by the Federal Office of Rent Control. The landlords appealed judgments of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), finding that the landlords were only entitled to the increases prospectively from the date the increase was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord filed summary proceedings against four tenants seeking to evict them for nonpayment. At the time of the landlords' applications to the Federal rent officials, all four tenants were occupying their respective apartments under unexpired written leases, but before the date of the orders increasing the maximum rents allowable, all four leases had expired by their terms, and none of them had been renewed, so that, when the federal orders came through, all four respondents were statutory tenants. The landlords demanded payment at the increased rents: prospectively, to which tenants agreed, and also retroactively back to the application dates, as the orders provided. Each tenant denied any obligation to make good the added amounts of rent for the period elapsed from the application date to the order date. On appeal, the court held that the rent increases became effective on the respective dates of expiration of the four leases and the landlords were entitled to the increased rent from that date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the lower court was modified to provide that the landlords were entitled to rent increases from the date of expiration of each tenants' lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - landlord and tenant - Federal rent regulation - retroactive rent increases without notice to statutory tenants - (1) under Federal rent regulation, Federal Housing Expediter validly ordered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rent increases retroactive to date of landlords' petitions, without notice to tenants whose leases had meantime expired; but, under provision in leases that if, during term of lease or any renewal or extension thereof, increase were Federally allowed tenant should pay increased rental on first day of following month, such increases are collectible only back to expiration dates of leases - (2) such provision in leases not carried over into statutory tenancies - (3) fixation of maximum emergency rents of statutory tenants is not judicial but legislative act, and was validly delegated by Congress to administrative agency without requirement of notice - (4) State courts may not overrule Federal Housing Expediter's determination - (5) omission from Federal Housing and Rent Acts of 1947 and 1948 of provision of Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 giving exclusive jurisdiction to Federal Emergency Court of Appeals to determine validity of Federal rent regulations, did not give State courts such power - (6) during pendency of petitions landlords had to accept rents theretofore fixed and are not thereby estopped from collecting retroactive increases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Under the provisions of the Controlled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Housing Rent Regulations, the Federal Housing Expediter, on petition of landlords for increases in the maximum allowable rents on the ground of hardship, may authorize rent increases retroactively to the date of the petitions.  Notice of such application was not required by the regulations. In this case, the tenants had leases when the applications were filed in September, 1947, but by the time the retroactive orders were made in April, 1948, all the leases had expired. It was stated in the leases that: &quot;The rent herein provided for is the maximum rent which the Landlord may collect under the O.P.A. [predecessor of the Expediter] rent regulations in force at the time of the execution of this lease. In the event that at any time during the term of this lease, or any renewal or extension thereof, such regulations * * * are cancelled or modified, or if the O.P.A. grants an increase * * * the tenant will pay a rental of [$] per month or as much thereof as is legally permissible or allowed, commencing the first day of the calendar month following the cancellation or modification of such regulation, or the allowance of an increase&quot;.  The retroactive increases are valid and collectible, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but not further back than the expiration dates of the leases - November 1, 1947, December 1, 1947, and April 1, 1948, respectively - since such lease-fixed rentals controlled until expiration. Final orders of dispossess in summary proceedings should be modified accordingly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  After the leases expired, the above-quoted provision was not carried over into the ensuing statutory tenancy. Each tenant remained in the landlord's property, not by virtue of any agreement, but by virtue of the compulsion which the rent law and regulation exerted on the landlord to allow the tenant to remain.  Some provisions of a lease are read into a statutory tenancy, so as to work out a complete relationship, but not a provision which the parties themselves specifically restricted to the term of the lease and any renewal or extension thereof.  This provision, therefore, has no effect, except to prevent any increase from reaching back earlier than the expiration dates of the leases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Their leases having expired, the tenants became statutory tenants; that is, tenants who hold over not because they have any property right or estate in the premises but because emergency laws forbid their eviction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as long as they pay the rent. The orders for retroactive rent increases without notice to them did not unconstitutionally deprive them of property or due process.  Fixation of the maximum rent to be paid by a statutory tenant during his emergency occupancy is not a judicial, but a legislative act, and the actual computation thereof was validly delegated by Congress to an administrative agency, the Housing Expediter.  Congress itself could have fixed emergency rents without any hearing or notice to landlords or tenants, and Congress need not make that requirement when it delegates the task to an administrative agency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Moreover, the State courts, when shown the Federal Housing Expediter's determination, may not overrule it for supposed invalidity.  Indeed, under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (art. VI), the State courts, in appropriate proceedings, are under a positive duty to enforce an administrative order by which a Federal agency performs the functions assigned to it by Congress.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Congress omitted from the Housing and Rent Acts of 1947 and 1948 the provision of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 which had conferred exclusive jurisdiction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the Federal Emergency Court of Appeals and on the United States Supreme Court to determine the validity of Federal rent regulations. That deletion left the law where it had been before - that State courts have no jurisdiction to review Federal administrative orders.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  During the pendency of their petitions to the Federal Housing Expediter for rent increases, the landlords were forbidden to accept more than the rents theretofore fixed, and, therefore, there is no basis for charging them thereby with waiver or estoppel as to the collection of the retroactive rent increases.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord brought a petition in summary proceedings to recover possession of the tenant's apartment for nonpayment of rent. The trial court denied the petition without prejudice because the landlord did not comply with Local Law No. 73, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; U41-7.0. The landlord appealed from that decision and claimed that the local law was not valid under the state constitution. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that the local law was not consistent with the Civil Practice Act, the state statute that regulated summary proceedings, because it imposed prerequisite &quot;additional restrictions&quot; upon the right of the landlord to evict the tenant from the apartment. The court ruled that the inconsistency violated the language of the Home Rule Amendment of the state constitution that limited the city's power to only adopt local laws that were not inconsistent with the laws of the state.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - landlord and tenant - local law fixing rents and restricting evictions - separability - (1) direct appeal may be taken to Court of Appeals from final order of Municipal Court which dismissed summary proceedings for nonpayment of rent without prejudice to new proceedings after landlord shall have complied with local law; local law is &quot;statutory provision of the state&quot;, constitutionality of which is only question to be considered on appeal (N.Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 7, subd. [2] ) - (2) Local Law No. 73 of 1949 of City of New York, which declares&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  emergency, fixes maximum rents of apartments, and requires certificate from city commission before commencement of any summary proceedings, is invalid as &quot;inconsistent with the * * * laws of the state&quot; (N.Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 12; Civ. Prac. Act, art. 83); order of Municipal Court reversed - (3) in view of separability clause in local law, question whether rent-fixing portion is separable from invalid restrictions on summary proceedings does not turn on division into sections but on whether city council would have enacted one part if aware other was void; entire text shows that city council regarded both parts as essential to declared purpose; severance and remodeling beyond judicial power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A local law of a city is a &quot;statutory provision of the state&quot; within the meaning of the State Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 7, subd. [2] ) which allows an appeal to the Court of Appeals &quot;as of right, from a judgment or order of a court of record of original jurisdiction which finally determines an action or special proceeding where the only question involved on the appeal is the validity of a statutory provision of the state or of the United States under the constitution of the state or of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the United States&quot;.  A direct appeal may thus be taken from a final order of the Municipal Court of the City of New York - a court of record (Judiciary Law, &sect; 2) - which, in summary proceedings for nonpayment of rent, had dismissed a landlord's petition &quot;without prejudice&quot; to a new proceeding after compliance by the landlord with the requirements of Local Law No. 73 of 1949 of the City of New York (Administrative Code, &sect; U41-7.0), since the only question to be considered on appeal is the validity of the local law under the Federal and State Constitutions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Local Law No. 73 declares that an emergency exists within the city by reason of a shortage of apartments and demands for excessive rent increases, fixes maximum rents of apartments at the amounts payable on March 1, 1949, authorizes a commission to make reasonable rent adjustments consistent with the emergency, requires that a certificate be obtained from the commission before an action or proceeding is commenced for collection or nonpayment of a rent greater than that payable on March 1, 1949, and before a tenant is excluded from possession, and further requires that before commencement of any summary proceedings other than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for nonpayment of a rent no greater than that of March 1, 1949, application for a certificate be made to the commission, setting forth in detail the facts upon which such action or proceeding is based.  The prerequisite restrictions thus imposed on a landlord's right under State law to maintain summary proceedings and obtain judgment for rent in arrears (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 83, &sect;&sect; 1410, 1425; &sect; 1; N.Y. City Mun. Ct. Code, &sect; 15; Judiciary Law, &sect; 2) are &quot;inconsistent with the * * * laws of the state&quot; (N.Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 12; see, too, City Home Rule Law, &sect;&sect; 11, 12) and render the local law unconstitutional and void. Final order of the Municipal Court should be reversed and the matter remitted to it for further proceedings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The local law has a separability clause.  The question whether the rentfixing provisions are separable from the restrictions on summary proceedings does not turn upon the law's division into sections or subdivisions, but upon whether the city council would have enacted the law if aware that the eviction provisions were invalid. An examination of the entire text shows that the city council regarded the rent and the eviction restrictions as equally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  essential to the declared purpose of the law.  Hence, the one set of restrictions cannot be separated from the other except by a remodeling on a scale which would be beyond the judicial power. </SPAN></P>

Essentially, the landlord claimed that the questioned provision deprived him of his property by preventing him from withdrawing from the business of renting. The court affirmed. The court found that under its police power New York had the authority to cut down the landlord's property rights without paying him just compensation. The court reasoned that the restriction imposed on the landlord was designed to meet a pressing and immediate exigency, namely, it prevented chaos and confusion. Under &sect; U41-7.0(g) the landlord was restricted from evicting the tenants until he found them another suitable place to live.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, commissioner and Public Service Commission of the State of New York, challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that annulled a commission order fixing temporary rates to be charged by petitioner utility for electrical service. The utility asserted that the commission violated the mandate of N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 114 (1934).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission appealed, as of right, the order of the appellate court annulling the commission's order fixing temporary electric rates for the utility. In setting the rates, the commission acted under N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 114 (1934) and ordered a 10 percent reduction in the total charges made to every consumer for electric service until final rates were determined. Although the appellate court thereafter annulled the commission's order, the rates continued in effect through stays of the appellate decision pending the court's review. The utility asserted that the commission violated the mandate of &sect; 114 that the temporary rates be fixed and determined so as to yield a return of not less than five percent upon the original cost, less accrued depreciation, of the physical property of the utility. It urged that the commission erred by estimating the accrued depreciation, rather than using the reserves accumulated for retirement or replacement, as shown in the utility's books. The court disagreed and held that the commission had authority to estimate the accrued depreciation. The recoupment provisions of &sect; 114 applied to prevent injustice if a temporary rate order was set too low.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate order annulling the decision of the commission and confirmed the commission's order setting a temporary rate for the electric service provide by the utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public utilities - temporary rates - statutory construction - (1) temporary rate order properly made by Public Service Commission after close of hearings on permanent rates - (2) temporary rates must yield not less than 5% return upon original cost of property &quot;less accrued depreciation&quot; ( Public Service Law, &sect; 114); commission properly made its own estimate of accrued depreciation - (3) corporate books which, under first paragraph&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of section 114 must &quot;show currently * * * reserves accumulated * * * for the retirement or replacement of * * * property&quot;, are merely presumptive evidence of actual &quot;accrued depreciation&quot; under second paragraph of section; commission lacks power to compel corporation to accumulate reserves in amounts other than corporation's own judgment dictates - (4) such construction gives full play to all requirements of statute and is consistent with all of its objectives as to promptness, accuracy and effect of temporary rates in determining permanent rates; if temporary rates too low, section provides for recoupment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 114 of the Public Service Law authorizes the Public Service Commission to fix temporary rates to be charged by a public utility corporation &quot;pending * * * final determination&quot; of a permanent rate proceeding. It is no objection to the validity of such an order that it was made after the close of hearings and pending final determination of permanent rates.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Under the second paragraph of section 114, the temporary rates shall be sufficient to yield a return of not less than 5% &quot;upon the original cost, less accrued depreciation, of the physical property of said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  public utility company&quot;.  The utility corporation's books listed $160,000,000 as a reserve for depreciation, but a witness for the corporation indicated that the actual depreciation exceeded that figure by some $40,000,000.  Other and variant figures are in the record.  An engineer employed by the commission testified that $95,000,000 was the amount of the deficiency in the reserve for depreciation. On all the evidence the commission was authorized to make its own estimate, which is not a final determination, that the accrued depreciation was actually $255,000,000, or $95,000,000 more than the book reserve of $160,000,000.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The provision as to &quot;accrued depreciation&quot; in the second paragraph of section 114 is not the same as the provision in the first paragraph of the section that the commission may require the corporation to keep records which &quot;show currently * * * the reserves accumulated * * * for the retirement or replacement of * * * property.&quot; In fixing permanent rates, the amount of accrued depreciation would have to be ascertained and reserves shown on the books, no matter how denominated, would not be controlling.  The commission may require that information as to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amount of accrued depreciation shall be preserved somewhere in the books and records of the corporation, but the commission lacks power to require the corporation to accumulate reserves in any amount other than the corporation's own judgment dictates. The relationship between the first and second paragraphs is given effect if it be presumed, as would ordinarily be the case, that, for purposes of a temporary rate order, the reserves under the first paragraph represent the accrued depreciation specified in the second paragraph - for such reserves unquestionably constitute some evidence of accrued depreciation. But this presumption is not made conclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  This construction gives full play to all of the statutory prescriptions and is consistent with all of its objectives.  Promptness will be achieved for reliance will continue to be placed upon the amount actually accumulated by the corporation rather than upon an estimate by the commission, except where the former is known to be misleading.  Substitution of a more accurate figure in the latter case would seem to be demanded if meaning is to be given to the direction of the third paragraph of the statute that &quot;the effect&quot; of temporary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rates is an element to be weighed and considered in determining permanent rates.  The value of experience under temporary rates is naturally increased in proportion to the correspondence between the base for such temporary rates and the base for permanent rates.  If a temporary rate is later found to have been placed too low, the recoupment provisions of section 114 apply to prevent any injustice to the corporation.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 435-7.0.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a clergyman who was arrested after he conducted a public meeting in which he disparaged two religions. Defendant was convicted by the magistrate court of violating &sect; 435-7.0 because he conducted the meeting without a permit. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's conviction. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. Section 435-7.0, which made it unlawful for a clergyman to preach on a public street without first obtaining a permit from the police commissioner, was a valid, constitutional time, place, and manner restriction. First, the police commissioner gave a permit to almost every applicant and only allowed police control of such meetings to the extent of ensuring that traffic flow would not be impaired. Second, it was within the police commissioner's power under &sect; 435-7.0 to revoke defendant's permit and to refuse to issue him a new one because defendant was engaging in behavior that incited riots. Such &quot;fighting words&quot; were not constitutionally protected speech. Thus, defendant was properly convicted of violating &sect; 435-7.0 because he had no defense for conducting his religious meeting without a permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court which affirmed the magistrate court's judgment convicting defendant of unlawfully conducting a religious meeting without a permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - municipal ordinances - meetings for religious purposes on city streets - police regulation - validity of requirement for permit - (1) clergyman convicted of violating ordinance forbidding preaching of religion on streets of New York City without permit; permit granted defendant had been revoked for denunciation of religions contrary to ordinance; conviction affirmed - (2) ordinance requires issuance of permit to clergyman and certain others and regulations give police control only&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by requiring advance notice of meeting and approval of location subject to traffic conditions; ordinance necessary street regulation; requirement of permit not unconstitutional here - (3) revocation of permit reviewable under article 78 of Civil Practice Act; impropriety of such revocation no defense here - (4) since defendant used permit to utter insults tending to incite disorder, public order and decency required that meetings be stopped.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A clergyman has been convicted of violating section 435-7.0 of the New York City Administrative Code which forbids any person to be instrumental in collecting an assemblage of persons for public worship or to ridicule religion or to preach atheism or agnosticism on the streets of the city, but authorizes preaching or expounding by one who has obtained a permit as an authorized representative of a religious, atheistic or agnostic group.  When arrested, defendant was conducting a religious meeting but without the required permit.  Upon this appeal he contends that the statute is unconstitutional on its face.  The conviction should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  As construed by the police department and as here applied, the ordinance is not unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  either as allowing the police commissioner to determine as a censor who may address the public on the streets or as prohibiting ridicule of religion. Reading into the ordinance the governing police regulations, it is clear that, merely upon application therefor, such a permit is granted for one year to any of the persons listed in the ordinance. Police control of meetings is allowed only to the extent of requiring advance notice to a police captain who must approve of the location requested unless traffic conditions make it inexpedient to use that site for such purpose.  So read, the law is no more than a necessary and reasonable regulation of the use for public meetings of the crowded streets of a great city.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  After a hearing on charges, defendant's permit to speak was revoked because &quot;contrary to the provisions of law under which the permit was issued&quot; he had &quot;ridiculed and denounced religion&quot;.  Subsequent applications by defendant for permits were denied and at the time of his arrest for speaking without a permit, he was again delivering denunciations against the same religions. Power to revoke such a permit for cause, while not specifically mentioned, is implied and, in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any case, alleged illegality of a revocation is reviewable by proceedings in the nature of certiorari (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78).  Moreover, impropriety of the revocation of a former license in this case was no defense.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) reversed a decree of the trial court insofar as it directed respondent insurance carrier to pay petitioner executors' proportionate share of federal and state taxes on certain life insurance policy proceeds allocated in accordance with N.Y. Decedent Estate Law &sect; 124. The executors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured died, and his beneficiary collected $ 50,000 in life insurance proceeds. Three years later, the treasury department increased the gross estate by including the policy proceeds and assessed a deficiency. Because the beneficiary had spent all of the proceeds and then died, the executors brought an action against the insurance carrier to recover its alleged proportionate share of the taxes due on the policy proceeds under &sect; 124. The trial court entered judgment in the executors' favor, but the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the reversal, finding that the insurance carrier was not liable for any portion of the taxes due on the policy proceeds because it was not &quot;an interested person&quot; under &sect; 124 as it had no beneficial interest in the estate and did not expect to receive a share of the decedent's assets. The court found that the carrier was not &quot;one in possession of estate property&quot; under &sect; 124 because it had long since distributed the entire amount of the policy's proceeds to the policy's beneficiary. The court also found that 26 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 826, 827 did not provide any basis on which to hold the insurance carrier liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the reversal of the trial court's ruling that the insurance carrier was liable for some portion of the estate taxes and declared that the insurance carrier was not liable for any portion of the estate taxes associated with the disbursement of the life insurance policy proceeds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - apportionment of estate taxes - (1) beneficiary of life insurance policy died destitute three years after receipt of proceeds of policy; executors of insured's estate which paid deficiency in Federal estate taxes seek reimbursement from insurer of portion of tax allocable to policy; petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  properly dismissed - (2) executor's right to reimbursement dependent on section 124 of Decedent Estate Law authorizing recovery by executor of proportionate amount of tax from &quot;whomever is in possession&quot; of taxable property or from &quot;persons interested&quot; in estate; insurer in neither class - (3) &quot;possession&quot; to be determined as of time reimbursement sought; insurer not party &quot;in possession&quot; since entire proceeds already paid over - (4) insurer not person &quot;interested in estate&quot; since term means one who has beneficial interest therein - (5) insurer not liable under Internal Revenue Code which authorizes proportionate recovery of taxes from &quot;beneficiary&quot; of insurance and also from &quot;transferee&quot; or &quot;trustee&quot; of property not coming to executor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Shortly after the death of one who was insured under a policy of life insurance issued by respondent the entire proceeds of the policy were paid to the beneficiary. Three years later a deficiency of Federal estate taxes based on such payment was assessed by the Treasury Department and the claim paid by the executors. Meantime the beneficiary had died destitute after dissipating the funds received.  In this proceeding by the executors to have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that portion of the Federal estate tax allocable to the policy of insurance charged against the insurance carrier, an order of the Appellate Division dismissing the petition should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The executor's right to seek reimbursement from the insurance carrier under section 124 of the Decedent Estate Law which provides for the apportionment of estate taxes depends upon whether the insurance carrier falls within one of the two classes of persons named in the statute.  Section 124 states that where property to be taxed does not come into the possession of the executor, he shall recover the proportionate amount of the tax from &quot;whomever is in possession&quot; of the taxable property or from the &quot;persons interested in the estate&quot; as defined in section 249-m of the Tax Law. Under the facts of the instant case, the insurance carrier cannot be said to fall in either class.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Since the insurer paid out the entire proceeds of the policy to the beneficiary in 1937, it is not now in fact &quot;in possession&quot; of any of the proceeds of the policy.  The period for determining &quot;possession&quot; is at the time when the executor seeks reimbursement. On the theory that the proceeds were segregated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into two separate funds, one for taxes which should have been paid over, the insurance company would be made a withholding agent for the tax authority.  Section 124 is an apportionment statute, not a tax statute.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Scott</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 249 App. Div. 524, affd.  274 N.Y. 538, distinguished.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Liability may not be imposed on the insurer as a &quot;person interested in the estate&quot; on the ground that it &quot;received&quot; the property, and obtained a &quot;benefit&quot; on discharge of its obligation.  A &quot;person interested in the estate&quot; can only mean a person who has a beneficial interest in the estate and who expects to share or has received a share of the assets left by the decedent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Nor may sanction for the executor's action be found in the Internal Revenue Code (U.S. Code, tit. 26, &sect; 826, subd. [c]; &sect; 827, subd. [b] ) which makes no general provision for apportionment of taxes.  The statute - which provides for recovery by the executor of taxes paid on proceeds of insurance receivable by a beneficiary - directs recovery from &quot;such beneficiary&quot; of the proper portion of the total tax but a beneficiary of the proceeds is the only one on whom liability is cast.  Under another provision, personal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  liability for the proportionate share of unpaid taxes attributable to property not coming into the hands of the executor is imposed on the transferee, trustee or beneficiary. An insurance company is not a transferee or trustee and is, therefore, not covered by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the stockholders of the merged company, appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendant surviving corporation dismissing the first cause of action in the complaint, and granted the motion dismissing for insufficiency, but with leave to amend, the second, third, and fourth causes of action alleged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholders attacked the constitutionality of N.Y. Stock Corporation Law &sect; 85(1), (5), (7), which authorized the merger of electric, gas, or steam corporations if approved by the public service commission. The merging or taking corporation had to own 95 percent or more of the stock of the merged, or taken, corporation. Following the procedures set out in N.Y. Stock Corporation Law &sect; 85, the company was merged into the corporation. The stockholders refused the appraisal proceedings and never accepted the price offered by the corporation for their stock. The stockholders claimed that their constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 were violated. The court affirmed the judgment below, holding that all causes of action were properly dismissed for insufficiency of law. The court found that N.Y. Stock Corporation Law &sect; 85 was not unconstitutional. The remedy available to the stockholders once the merger took place was an appraisal. As minority stockholders, they had no constitutional right to deliberate, consult or vote on the merger, to have prior notice thereof, or prior opportunity to object.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgement below, which affirmed the grant of summary judgement in favor of the surviving corporation dismissing on the merits, the first cause of action set forth in the complaint, and granted a motion by the surviving corporation dismissing for insufficiency, but with leave to amend, the second, third and fourth causes of action alleged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations - merger of public utility corporations - rights of dissenting stockholder - (1) utility corporation, of which defendant utility held 99.6% of stock, was merged into defendant under section 85 of Stock Corporation Law; plaintiffs, holders of few shares in merged corporation, neither took price offered by defendant for shares nor sought judicial appraisal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereof; in action to have merger declared invalid, complaint properly dismissed - (2) first cause of action alleges unconstitutionality of merger statute for lack of due process, equal protection of laws and impairment of contract rights; further causes allege ownership by merged corporation of choses in action against defendant; latter causes not available to individual stockholders nor actionable here by merged corporation since it no longer exists - (3) by virtue of power to amend charters of corporations (N.Y. Const., art. X, &sect; 1) Legislature may make nonconfiscatory provision for merger of corporations - (4) on merger dissenting shareholder's only remedy is appraisal of stock (Stock Corporation Law, &sect; 21); disabilities involved in merger constitute no deprivation of due process or contract rights - (5) where appraisal provided dissenting stockholder may not reject merger on assertion of injustice involved in appraisal - (6) statute permitting merger by utility corporations in case of less than 100% ownership not improper since applicable to all public utilities as class; such class may be differentiated from other corporations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In 1945, following the procedures set out&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in section 85 of the Stock Corporation Law, there was merged into defendant another utility corporation of which defendant had held 99.6% of the stock for more than ten years.  The resolution of merger provided for payment by defendant of $135 per share for such shares of the merged corporation as were not already owned by defendant, the surviving corporation.  Plaintiffs, who held 59 shares of stock in the merged corporation, neither accepted the price offered nor took appraisal proceedings in accordance with a letter from defendant pointing out that, under section 21 of the Stock Corporation Law, stockholders unwilling to accept the offered price might have appraisers appointed to value their stock. In this action plaintiffs attack the merger as illegal on the ground that the statute is unconstitutional.  All the causes of action set forth in the complaint were properly dismissed for insufficiency in law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The first cause of action alleges that section 85, permitting a merger without notice to or consent of the minority, deprives plaintiffs and the merged corporation of their property without due process of law, denies them the equal protection of the laws and impairs the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contract rights of plaintiffs and of their corporation.  The second, third and fourth causes of action, similarly brought by plaintiffs for themselves and for all other stockholders who would join, set out transactions between the two corporations before the merger in which it is said that the surviving defendant took advantage of its position to benefit itself to the detriment of the other corporation.  Insofar as these three counts are pleaded by plaintiffs individually, they are not maintainable since no individual stockholder has any such right of action.  Insofar as they are set forth on behalf of the merged corporation, the alleged wrongs are actionable only if the merged corporation still exists and, since section 85 and its application to this merger are not unconstitutional, the sufficiency of these causes need not be further examined.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Under the express reservation of power therefor in the State Constitution (art. X, &sect; 1), the Legislature may alter, suspend and repeal the charters of corporations and this provision is part of the contract or charter of every domestic corporation.  It authorizes the Legislature to make appropriate non-confiscatory provisions for mergers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4.If a merger is duly consummated in accordance with the statutes, the remedy of appraisal and payment is the only one available to a dissenting shareholder entitled to receive full compensation for his rights.  His disabilities with respect to voting on the merger and lack of prior notice or opportunity to object are the result of his status as a member of a minority and there is no deprivation therein of due process or of contract rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Every right of a dissenting shareholder is to be appraised and paid for but, where such an appraisal and judicial control and review thereof have been provided, plaintiffs may not refuse it and upset the merger merely on their assertion that the appraisal would not have done them justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Amendments to section 85 permitting merger of public utility corporations in case of less than 100% ownership - alleged by plaintiffs to be a special privilege to a special class - apply to all corporations of the particular class.  Public utility corporations may be subjected to treatment differing from that applied to other kinds of corporations and in this instance the Legislature had and stated a reason for the differentiation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother sought review of the decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the first judicial department (New York), which affirmed the trial courts grant of appellee putative father's motion to quash summons in the filiation action instituted by the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother was a resident and national of Germany and instituted a filiation action against the father. The father filed motion to quash summons and asserted that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the mother and child were not United States residents. The trial court granted the motion and the appellate court affirmed. The mother challenged the decision and the court affirmed. N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 135 (L. 1925, ch. 255) controlled all matters dealing with paternity actions and stated that it was not a bar to an action if the mother or child resided in another county or state. The language &quot;or state&quot; was limited to meaning other states of the United States and did not encompass other countries. Section 64 of the New York City Criminal Courts Act (L. 1910, ch. 659, as amd. by L. 1930, ch. 434, and as renumd. by L. 1933, ch. 746), was not controlling because as a local law it could not supercede jurisdiction as provided by state statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grant of the motion to quash the summons issued to the father in the filiation action brought by the mother.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children born out of wedlock - paternity proceedings - jurisdiction where mother and child reside in foreign country - (1) complaint in paternity proceeding brought in Court of Special Sessions of New York City by mother, resident of Germany, against putative father in New York City, properly dismissed - (2) appeal to Court of Appeals properly taken as from final order in criminal proceeding - (3) section 135 of Domestic Relations Law controls all paternity proceedings and defines jurisdiction of courts therein; residence of mother&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or child in &quot;another * * * state&quot; no bar to jurisdiction if defendant resides here but word &quot;state&quot; in statute does not include foreign country - (4) section 135 derived from Uniform Illegitimacy Act which relates only to States of Union; requirement that complaining mother be resident of United States jurisdictional limitation - (5) section 64 of New York City Criminal Courts Act which provides that birth of child outside State shall not bar proceeding against putative father resident in New York City not to be construed as exception to jurisdictional requirements of section 135.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A paternity proceeding instituted in the Court of Special Sessions of New York City by a mother who is a national of Germany and who resides in that country, charging a resident of New York County with having fathered her child while he served in the occupation forces, was properly dismissed on defendant's challenge to the court's jurisdiction.  The courts of this State lack jurisdiction to entertain a filiation proceeding if the mother and child reside in a foreign country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Following unanimous affirmance by the Appellate Division of the dismissal of the proceeding the matter is properly before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court of Appeals (by permission of the Presiding Justice of the appellate court) as an appeal from a final order in a criminal proceeding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Paternity proceedings are creations solely of the Legislature and section 135 of the Domestic Relations Law is controlling in all suits involving such proceedings and defines the jurisdiction of every court hearing such matters.  Although the statute provides that it shall be no bar to the jurisdiction of any of the courts enumerated that the complaining mother or child &quot;resides in another county or state&quot; if the defendant be a resident of this State, it was not intended that a foreign country - in this case, Germany - should be included within the term &quot;another * * * state&quot;.  By coupling that phrase with the words &quot;this state&quot;, it was demonstrated that the word &quot;state&quot; refers only to other States of the United States including, perhaps, its territories and possessions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 135 was taken almost verbatim from the Uniform Illegitimacy Act, a statute concerned exclusively with the problem of filiation and support in the various States of the Union and referring only to subdivisions of this country.  The requirement that the complaining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mother be a resident of the United States is thus a jurisdictional limitation on any court petitioned to hear the paternity proceeding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 64 of the New York City Criminal Courts Act, cited by complainant, provides, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the birth of a child outside this State shall not bar proceedings against the putative father in the city of New York if he resides or is found therein.  However, even if, insofar as the courts of New York City are concerned, section 64 were to be considered as creating an exception to the jurisdictional prerequisites demanded by section 135 of the Domestic Relations Law, the Constitution of this State would probably intervene to stamp such a construction as invalid because of the distinction granted in favor of the courts in New York City.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants contended that the town was subject to the restraints of the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions and that it could not lawfully discriminate against the tenants in renting apartments. The town was a private corporation organized as a redevelopment company under the Redevelopment Companies Law. The city granted it tax exemption for 25 years only to the extent of the enhanced value to be created by the project. The court noted that tax exemption was given to many organizations, which necessarily limit their benefits to a restricted group, and that it had not yet been held that the recipients were subject to the restraints of the U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court found that the legislature deliberately and intentionally refrained from imposing any restriction upon a redevelopment company in its choice of tenants. The court held that the town could not be held to answer for its policy under the equal protection clauses. The court dismissed the tenant's appeal, concluding that the aid, which the state had afforded to the town, was not sufficient to transmute its conduct into state action under the constitution.</SPAN></P>

XVIII) of State Constitution and Redevelopment Companies Law, low-rent housing for persons of low income is government function, but rehabilitation and redevelopment of substandard areas is function of private enterprise aided by government; entire cost of acquisition and construction here borne by redevelopment corporation and insurance corporation - (5) Public Housing Law ( &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  223) prohibits discrimination, but Redevelopment Companies Law Does not - (6) city granted partial tax exemption though it knew corporation would not rent to Negroes; local law prohibiting tax exemption in future cases of discrimination expressly excludes projects already contracted for - (7) public purpose was fulfilled by rehabilitation and redevelopment of substandard area; corporate owners' private rental policy is not State action or governmental function - (8) city's contract of tax exemption and use of its power of eminent domain to assemble land for construction do not subject redevelopment corporation to Fourteenth Amendment, in absence of restraints derived from statute or common law - (9) appellant taxpayer does not have status to challenge as unconstitutional acts of corporation and of city in granting tax exemption; therefore his appeal, on consolidated record, from unanimous affirmance by Appellate Division of dismissal of his complaint presents no constitutional question to Court of Appeals and must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Under the circumstances of this case, the exclusion, by a corporation organized under the Redevelopment Companies Law, of Negroes from consideration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as prospective tenants of apartment houses owned by it, is not State action or discrimination in civil rights and is not prohibited by the provision of the United States Constitution (14th Amendt.) that &quot;No State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws&quot; or by the section of the State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 11, adopted in 1938) which reads that &quot;No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws of this state or any subdivision thereof.  No person shall, because of race, color, creed or religion, be subjected to any discrimination in his civil rights by any other person or by any firm, corporation, or institution, or by the state or any agency or subdivision of the state.&quot; The complaint in an action against the corporation and an insurance corporation which owns its stock, seeking an injunction against such discrimination, was properly dismissed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The first sentence of section 11 of article I of the State Constitution is no broader in coverage than the above-quoted language of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The second sentence of section 11, although applicable to private persons and private&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporations, protects only against &quot;discrimination in * * * civil rights&quot;.  It was stated in the proceedings of the 1938 Constitutional Convention that this provision was not self-executing and that the civil rights protected by it were those already denominated as such in the Constitution itself, in the Civil Rights Law or in other statutes.  No statute in New York recognizes the opportunity to acquire interests in real property as a civil right.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The housing article of the State Constitution (art. XVIII, adopted in 1938) is instinct with the theory (a) that low-rent housing for persons of low income is to be a function of government, but (b) that the rehabilitation of substandard areas is to be a function of private enterprise aided by government.  The latter is the situation in this case.  The entire cost of acquisition of the land and of the demolition and construction has been advanced by defendant insurance corporation which owns all the stock and debentures of defendant redevelopment corporation.  Under article XVIII, a redevelopment corporation is not a public corporation, but is a corporation regulated by law as to rents, profits, dividends and disposition of its property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or franchises and engaged in providing housing facilities.  There is nothing in the Constitution or Redevelopment Companies Law enacted pursuant thereto indicating that the State is to have any part in the operation of dwellings resulting from the rehabilitation of substandard areas.  Section 10 of the constitutional article seems to provide expressly to the contrary.  Section 21 of the statute provides for visitation and control of a redevelopment corporation by a &quot;supervising agency&quot; which means the Superintendent of Insurance as to this corporation all of whose stock and debentures are owned by an insurance corporation (&sect; 3); but where, as here, a contract is entered into by a municipality, a redevelopment corporation and an insurance corporation, the superintendent has no power of supervision since he has approved the contract (&sect; 15).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The Legislature intentionally refrained from imposing any restriction upon a redevelopment company in its choice of tenants. Repeated attempts in the Legislature to alter that policy of the statute have failed.  On the other hand, the Public Housing Law ( &sect; 223), which is applicable to State-constructed, lowcost housing projects, expressly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prohibits discrimination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The contract, under which the city granted tax exemption for twenty-five years only to the extent of the enhanced value to be created by the redevelopment, was approved by the board of estimate of the city of New York despite a minority of the board who were against approval on the ground that it was expected that the redevelopment company would not rent to Negroes.  Thereafter the city council passed legislation withholding tax exemption from any subsequent redeveloment company unless it gave assurance that no discrimination would be practiced in its rental policies, but expressly excluding any project &quot;hitherto agreed upon or contracted for&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; J41-1.2).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The discrimination practiced by the redevelopment corporation would violate the equal protection clauses of the Constitutions if it were done by or under the constraint of a governmental body, or if the corporation were performing functions of a governmental character in matters of great public interest, or if the State had lent its power in support of the corporation's private rental policy.  But the twenty-five-year tax exemption which the city contracted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to give the corporation, the aggregation of eighteen city blocks through use of the city's power of eminent domain and through exchange of bordering tracts for streets which the city closed, and the size of the building project which forms a community of 25,000 people within the city, are not sufficient to transmute the corporation's rental policy into State action or governmental function.  The public purpose has been fulfilled by the rehabilitation of a substandard area.This conclusion is reinforced by the provision of the State Constitution which specifically negates any authorization to State or city to engage in any private business or enterprise in connection with the rehabilitation of substandard areas (art. XVIII, &sect; 10).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  The fundamental policy implicit in our Federal system indicates that political processes must furnish the means for extension of the rights defined in the Fourteenth Amendment to areas wherein they have not heretofore been asserted.  Though tax exemption and power of eminent domain are freely given to many organizations which necessarily limit their benefits to a restricted group, it has not yet been held that the recipients are subject to the restraints&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such restraints as have been imposed upon their freedom of action are most appropriately derived from statute or common law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  In another action on appeal, presented upon a consolidated record, plaintiff-appellant is a taxpayer who seeks to enjoin not only the redevelopment corporation and the insurance corporation but also to enjoin the city from granting tax exemption to and further performing its contract with the corporations unless they cease discriminating against Negroes.  Defendant's motions for judgment on the pleadings were granted at Special Term and judgment of dismissal was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division.  Since the appellant's status as a taxpayer does not support an action to challenge as unconstitutional the acts of respondent companies and officials, his appeal does not present the constitutional question essential to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 588, subd. 1, cl. [a] ) and must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the first judicial department, which unanimously affirmed a judgment of the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York convicting them of violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 965, entitled &quot;Excessive charges in connection with rental agreements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that that &sect; 965 was not a rent control statute and did not purport, singly or in conjunction with other statutes or regulations, to prescribe or limit the amount of rent that they could have charged. The court held that there was no incorporation of any other laws by reference as prohibited by N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 or an unlawful delegation of legislative powers in N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The court held that no extra premiums were tolerated, and the fees collected had to have represented the charges for actual services. The court affirmed, holding that the N.Y. Real Property Law &sect;&sect; 442-d, 440 et seq., in permitting a broker to collect commissions for legitimate services, gave defendants no general license to exact tribute from a prospective tenant, and the trial court's findings were supported by overwhelming proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed each judgment, holding that the evidence supported the convictions and the statute under which they were convicted in no way violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - excessive charges in connection with rental agreements - (1) defendants, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon proof that goods or money were exacted by them in return for offering housing preferences, properly convicted of violation of section 965 of Penal Law prohibiting acceptance of excessive charges in connection with rental agreements - (2) statute not unconstitutional by reason of incorporation of other laws by reference (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 16) or unlawful delegation of legislative power (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 1) - (3) statute not vague and uncertain or lacking ascertainable standards - (4) whether defendants licensed real estate brokers or not, issue on trial is whether payment exacted was of type condemned or for legitimate service; evidence shows violation of statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Defendants, each of whom exacted from apartment seekers goods or money on the strength of representations that such contributions would facilitate and influence the securing of housing accommodations, were properly convicted of violating section 965 of the Penal Law which makes it a misdemeanor for anyone to request or accept from another &quot;any donation, gratuity, bonus, emolument, gift, payment or thing of value, in addition to lawful charges&quot; on the understanding that &quot;compliance * * * will facilitate, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  influence or procure an advantage over others&quot; as to rental of real property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.Section 965 is not a rent control statute nor does it purport singly or in conjunction with other statutes to prescribe or limit the amount of rent that may be charged.  Therefore, defendants' claim that there was either an unconstitutional incorporation of other laws by reference (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 16) or an unlawful delegation of legislative powers (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 1), cannot be sustained.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The statute is not vague and uncertain or lacking an ascertainable standard.  It meets the constitutional tests by giving reasonable notice of what must be done and what must be avoided and as to how the charge may be defended.  Acceptance of donations and gratuities in connection with arranging leases is prohibited by the statute.  The phrase &quot;in addition to lawful charges&quot; defines no essential element of the crime, simply serving to limit the preceding words &quot;payment or thing of value&quot; and to assimilate their meaning to that of the operative and controlling words - donation, gratuity, bonus or gift. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  In permitting a broker to collect commissions for legitimate services the Real Property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law ( &sect; 440 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) gives no general license to exact tribute on the strength of a representation of an advantage to be gained thereby in securing a lease. The question presented upon the trial of a defendant who is a licensed real estate broker is no different from that involved in the case of an unlicensed person. In each the issue is - was the payment in fact exacted as a special premium of the type condemned or was it received in payment of some legitimate service.  In these prosecutions the People more than met the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants, licensed or not, exacted large sums, not in return for legitimate services, but in manifest violation of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator inmate pleaded guilty in a county court to first-degree robbery. Two years before his sentence was due to expire the inmate filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in a supreme court. He appealed after the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Fourth Judicial Department (New York), reversed the supreme court's order, which had sustained the habeas application and had ordered respondent warden to release the inmate from prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Seventeen years after he was sentenced, the inmate filed a motion in the supreme court to vacate and set his conviction aside on the ground that, at the time he entered his guilty plea, he had been deprived of his constitutional right to counsel. After the motion was denied, the inmate filed the habeas application asserting the same grounds as the basis for relief. Although the application was initially granted, the appellate court reversed, holding that the inmate had failed to overcome the presumption of regularity surrounding his conviction and that a writ of habeas corpus was not a proper remedy. In affirming, the court agreed that habeas corpus was not a proper remedy under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1231. There were no exceptional circumstance that would justify the supreme court, as another and different court without appellate jurisdiction, in setting aside the inmate's judgment of conviction. The inmate should file a motion in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis in the county court to vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction. Coram nobis was the proper remedy for any prisoner who claimed to have been unconstitutionally deprived of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - coram nobis and habeas corpus - (1) coram nobis motion in court in which conviction was obtained is exclusive remedy of prisoner who claims he was deprived of constitutional right to counsel; writ of habeas corpus properly dismissed - (2) prisoner, convicted in 1927, whose coram nobis motion was denied in 1945 when no appeal lay, may apply for leave to renew motion, and appeal will now lie if leave be refused or motion is again denied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The exclusive remedy of a prisoner who claims that he was deprived of his constitutional right to counsel is a proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the nature of a writ of error </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the court which convicted him to vacate its judgment of conviction. Under our statute (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1231) and cases, a writ of habeas corpus is not the proper remedy. In this instance such a writ was properly dismissed, because the court wherein the judgment of conviction was rendered is a competent tribunal which had jurisdiction of the person of the accused and general jurisdiction of criminal offenses.  There is no exceptional circumstance in this case which would justify another and different court, without appellate jurisdiction, in setting aside such a judgment of conviction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In 1945, by writ of error </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the prisoner moved in the County Court wherein he had been convicted in 1927 to vacate his sentence and that motion was denied.  At that time the statute had not been enacted which now permits an appeal to be taken from such a determination (L. 1947, ch. 706).  However, the prisoner is not now precluded from obtaining leave to move again by way of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the County Court.  If leave be refused or the motion again denied, the correctness of such determination may be reviewed on appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State challenged an order in favor of appellee claimant by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which dismissed the State's appeal as untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State claimed that the dismissal of its claim was in error because the merits should have been determined by the appellate court. The claimant paid unemployment insurance contributions as it was compelled to do so; however the claim had long been barred as the court of claims held below. The court held that the payments were illegally compelled by the State, and additionally, they were barred by the time limitations prescribed by the Legislature. The court held that the court of claims was bound to accept the opinion of the appellate court as the law of the case. But it held that the final judgment for the claimant was occasioned by the parties themselves through their stipulation of agreed facts, and, therefore, &sect; 590 of the Civil Practice Act had no application to this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - restitution of taxes - limitation of actions - appeal - (1) claim against State, for restitution of unemployment insurance contributions paid under statute subsequently declared unconstitutional, barred by six months' limitation in Court of Claims Act ( &sect; 10, subd. 4) applicable to &quot;claim for breach of contract, express or implied&quot; - (2) unemployment insurance contributions are excise tax on employer, in which statutory trust has no settlor; Statute of Limitations commenced to run when employer paid tax - (3) remedy prescribed by Labor Law (art. 18, &sect; 570, subd. 6) is no bar to right to restitution of taxes paid under compulsion of void statute - (4) Appellate Division reversed dismissal of claim by Court of Claims and remitted case for hearing on merits; such order decided only that claim was sufficient on its face; parties then stipulated facts and Court of Claims gave claimant judgment; no direct appeal lay therefrom to Court of Appeals - (5) when Appellate Division, by divided court, dismissed appeal of State, judgment for claimant was entered in Court of Claims; claimant thus had equivalent of final judgment of affirmance from which State properly appealed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Court of Appeals as of right.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Collection of unemployment insurance contributions from state banks for the period between August 10, 1939, and December 31, 1939, was declared unconstitutional in 1944 for the reason that national banks had not been subjected to such an exaction during the same period.  A claim against the State filed in 1945 by a State bank for restitution of unemployment insurance contributions paid by it for the same period, is barred by a requirement of the Court of Claims Act ( &sect; 10, subd. 4) that &quot;A claim for breach of contract, express or implied * * * shall be filed within six months after the accrual of such claim&quot;.  The claim accrued immediately on payment of the tax.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Unemployment insurance contributions are an excise tax on an employer and such contributions are trust funds under the jurisdiction of statutory trustees.  Unlike trusts set up by wills or deeds, however, statutory trusts are enactments of the Legislature in which no &quot;settlor&quot; plays a part.  It cannot be said that the illegally enforced payment of the tax resulted in a trust for the benefit of the payer as &quot;settlor&quot; and that the Statute of Limitations did not commence to run against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such &quot;settlor&quot; until demand for a refund had been made upon the State as a statutory trustee.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Labor Law (art. 18, &sect; 570, subd. 6), does not establish an exclusive remedy for obtaining a refund of taxes paid under compulsion of a void statute, and claimant, therefore, had the right to seek restitution in this proceeding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  A dismissal of the claim by the Court of Claims as barred by the Court of Claims Act ( &sect; 10, subd. 4) was reversed by the Appellate Division and the case remitted &quot;for a hearing on the merits.&quot; Thereupon, in the Court of Claims, the parties entered into a stipulation of agreed facts and the court awarded judgment to claimant. An appeal therefrom by the State was dismissed by the Appellate Division, apparently on the erroneous theory that its earlier order had been a mandate for recovery by the claimant, and that therefore only a direct appeal lay to the Court of Appeals (under Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 590, subd. [1] ).  The earlier order decided only that the claim on its face was sufficient and not barred by the Statute of Limitations, and it was the parties themselves who occasioned the final judgment of the Court of Claims through their stipulation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of agreed facts.  Consequently, subdivision (1) of section 590 of the Civil Practice Act did not apply to this case and the dismissal by the Appellate Division of the State's appeal to that court was unjustified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Upon the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the appeal, judgment in claimant's favor was entered in the office of the clerk of the Court of Claims.  At that stage, claimant had acquired the equivalent of a final judgment of affirmance by the Appellate Division.  Hence the State properly appealed from that judgment to the Court of Appeals as of right, two Justices of the Appellate Division having dissented (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 588, subd. 1, cl. [b] ).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant vendor sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which found in favor of respondent city comptroller and affirmed the decision of the special term, which struck out appellant's second cause of action for insufficiency in law and ordered that appellant's petition should thereafter consist only of the first cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The proceeding in the nature of certiorari was brought by appellant vendor against respondent city comptroller. Two actions were set forth in the petition. The first cause requested a review of a determination of respondent which assessed against appellant a deficiency of city sales taxes for the period of September 1, 1935 to December 31, 1940. The second cause requested review of respondent's determination that denied a claim made by appellant for a refund of city sales taxes that it paid to respondent in the period of April 1, 1936 to September 30, 1940. The refund claim asserted by appellant was filed more than three years after the one-year statute of limitations had run against that claim. Because of that delay, the special term struck out the second cause of action for insufficiency in law and ordered that the petition should thereafter consist only of the first cause. The appellate division affirmed and the court reversed. Because respondent opened the question of appellant's sales tax liability, appellant should have been entitled to set off, against any deficiency finally determined, the amount of any overpayment of sales taxes made during the period under review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court in favor of respondent city comptroller and against appellant vendor because appellant should have been given an equitable right to plead against respondent a recoupment claim for taxes of the same type that the vendor, as it alleged, had erroneously paid to respondent for the same period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Setoff and counterclaim - taxation - New York City sales tax - recoupment arising out of same transaction - limitation of time to claim refund - appeal - finality of determination - (1) city having assessed deficiency of sales taxes, vendor has equitable right to seek recoupment of sales taxes erroneously paid in same period, even though claim for such refund was made after expiration of period&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fixed by local law; recoupment process permits whole transaction to be examined in all its aspects - (2) dismissal, in article 78 proceeding, of cause of action to review city comptroller's denial of refund, severed it from cause of action to review comptroller's assessment of deficiency; affirmance of such order by Appellate Division, by divided vote, appealable as of right to Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A vendor paid sales taxes imposed by the City of New York and the city subsequently reopened the matter of the amount of the liability for a specified period and assessed a deficiency.  The vendor was thereby given an equitable right to plead against the city a claim for recoupment of taxes of the same type - erroneously paid by the vendor within the same period.  This is so even though the vendor's claim for a refund of such payments was made after the expiration of the period limited for sales tax refunds by the Administrative Code (&sect; N41-8.0, subd. a).  By means of recoupment a deduction may be made from a money claim arising out of the same transaction and the balance only recovered. Such a process permits a transaction which is made the subject of suit to be examined in all its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aspects and a judgment rendered that does justice in view of the one transaction as a whole.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In this proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act petitioner sought, by a first cause of action, to review the comptroller's determination assessing the deficiency and by a second cause of action to review the denial of a refund. Special Term struck out the second cause of action for insufficiency in law, thus severing the second cause of action from the first.  A subsequent order of affirmance by the Appellate Division was a final determination of the insufficiency of the second cause of action and said order having been made by a divided court an appeal therefrom was properly taken to the Court of Appeals as of right.  Upon such appeal the orders should be reversed and the matter remitted to Special Term for further proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed his conviction after trial by jury in the trial court for assault in the second degree. After affirming the conviction, the appellate division certified the matter to the court because defendant had raised a question of law in his appeal from the trial court's order denying his motion to vacate the indictment on grounds of discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to trial, defendant, who was African American, filed a motion to vacate the indictment on the grounds that the grand jury was unconstitutionally formed based on the alleged systematic and intentional exclusion of African American persons from the grand jury. The trial court held a hearing on defendant's motion. The New York Commissioner of Jurors testified that when he filled the vacancies on the grand jury list, he did not know the race of the persons selected. The trial court found that no African American persons had been selected for grand jury service in the county for a period of 10 years &quot;or so.&quot; The trial court credited the Commissioner's testimony and denied defendant's motion. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses. The court noted that the trial court found that according to a census, there was one African American person to every 33 persons in the county. The court determined that under the circumstances, the trial court's conclusion that defendant had not established a prima facie case of discrimination was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - grand jury - asserted exclusion of Negroes - (1) no prima facie case of discrimination against Negroes in selection of grand jurors established on hearing on motion to vacate indictment; judgment affirmed - (2) appellate court has no power to deny right of trial court to believe testimony of creditable witness, commissioner of jurors, that his questionnaire of prospective grand jurors as to color, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sex, weight, etc., was to identify criminal records - (3) trial court found that for ten years no Negro had been selected for grand jury list but that Negroes were serving on petit juries, and credited testimony of commissioner that he did not know color of persons selected; selections certified by board of judges who are not charged with discrimination - (4) in year of indictment, 45 persons were added to grand jury list to replace those dead and disabled; on basis of census of county, naming of only 1 Negro would have afforded proportionate representation among persons added that year; but qualifying statutes do not require racial representation - (5) contentions involving sufficiency of proof, breadth of prosecutor's cross-examination, and regularity of verdict, without merit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  After a hearing on a motion to vacate an indictment, made on the alleged ground that Negroes in the county were unconstitutionally discriminated against in the selection of grand jurors, the County Judge denied the motion on the ground that no prima facie case of discrimination had been established and the defendant was thereafter found guilty of assault by a trial jury as charged in the indictment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed.  The Court of Appeals cannot announce a contrary decision as matter of law on this record and, accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The County Judge credited testimony of the commissioner of jurors of the county that his reason for requiring prospective jurors to answer a questionnaire as to their color, sex, weight, height and color of eyes and hair, was to identify police department criminal records of persons of the same names as prospective jurors. An appellate court has no power to deny the right of the trier of the facts thus to believe a creditable witness.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The County Judge found that for &quot;ten years or so&quot; no Negro had been selected to serve on a grand jury, but that Negroes were constantly serving on petit juries, and he credited testimony of the commissioner of jurors that the latter did not know the color of the persons whose names he selected.  Under the statute (McKinney's Unconsol. Laws, &sect;&sect; 3802, 3813), there has long existed in the county a grand jury list of 600 names, selected by the commissioner from a petit jury list of approximately 18,000 names, and certified by a board of judges consisting of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the County Judge and the Supreme Court Justices resident in the county.  Additional names are selected by the commissioner every year to replace depletions by death, disability, or removal from the county; and over the years, the names of some trial jurors have been added to the grand jury list by the board of judges of their own motion.  Certification of the list has been the responsibility of the judges alone and no charge of discrimination (N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 11; U.S. Const., 14th Amendt.; cf. Civil Rights Law, &sect; 13) has here been made against them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  In 1946, when defendant was indicted, 45 grand jurors were added to replace that number who had died, become disabled, or removed from the county.  According to the 1940 census, there was 1 Negro to every 33 white persons in the county, so that the naming of only 1 Negro would have afforded proportionate representation to his race among those persons added to the grand jury list that year, assuming that all Negroes then resident in the county were duly qualified.  The relevant statutes, however, required no fixed representation of racial or other groups but authorized the board of judges to certify as grand jurors persons&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found by them to be &quot;Free from all legal exceptions; of fair character; of approved integrity; of sound judgment; and well informed.&quot; (Judiciary Law, &sect; 502, subd. 5; Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 223, 229-b; McKinney's Unconsol. Laws, &sect; 3813.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.Other points on appeal, involving the sufficiency of proof of the assault, the breadth of the prosecutor's cross-examination, and the regularity of the verdict, have been examined and found to be without merit.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholder filed a derivative action against the corporation, officers, and directors and to recover for alleged waste and mismanagement. The corporation filed a motion under N.Y. Gen. Corp. Law &sect; 61-b to require the stockholder to post collateral to secure the corporation's reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees. The stockholder objected on the basis that he did not have sufficient security to post such collateral and the trial court dismissed the action.

It must be assumed that the Legislature inquired and found (a) justification for making special provision as to derivative suits brought by holders of relatively small amounts of a corporation's stock and (b) occasion for requiring plaintiffs in such suits to give reasonable security for litigation expenses of defendants therein.  The section is not so palpably arbitrary or unduly discriminatory as to be obnoxious either to the due process clause or to the guarantee of equal protection of the laws.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  For many years plaintiff has conducted a private nonsectarian school consisting of nursery or preschool, kindergarten, elementary or primary and high school or secondary departments, as well as a two year junior college.  In this submission of a controversy, plaintiff seeks a declaration of unconstitutionality of a statute (Education Law, former &sect; 625, subd. B, par. 5, now &sect; 3210, subd. 2, par. e) which provides that no person other than the public school authorities or an established religious group shall establish or maintain a nursery school, kindergarten or elementary school giving certain instruction unless the school is registered under regulations prescribed by the Board of Regents. The statute is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  It is an attempted delegation of legislative power in violation of section 1 of article III of the State Constitution which states that the legislative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power of the State shall be vested in the Senate and Assembly.  The statute attempts to empower an administrative officer, the State Commissioner of Education, to register and license or to refuse to register and license private schools, under regulations to be adopted by him, with no standards or limitations of any sort.  The Legislature has not only failed to set out standards or tests by which the qualifications of the schools might be measured but has not specified even in most general terms what the subject matter of the regulations is to be.  There must be a clearly delimited field of action and also standards for action therein.  Here there is neither.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Nor can the field and limits of action, while not immediately expressed, be found elsewhere in the law.  The article of the Education Law (former art. 23, now art. 65) in which this law is found deals with &quot;compulsory education&quot;, as its title showed, and the section of which this particular paragraph is a part (former &sect; 625, now &sect; 3210) has to do, as the heading shows, with &quot;amount and character of required attendance&quot; but it cannot be that the Legislature was instructing the commissioner to make regulations concerning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attendance only, since the character and amount of compulsory attendance in both private and public schools was already minutely regulated in other parts of the section and elsewhere in said article.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Private schools have a constitutional right to exist and parents have a constitutional right to send their children to such schools.  The Legislature, under the police power, has a limited right to regulate such schools in the public interest. Such being the fundamental law of the subject, it would be intolerable for the Legislature to hand over to any official or group of officials an unlimited and undefined power to make such regulations as he or they should desire and to grant or refuse licenses to such schools depending upon their compliance with such regulations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a municipal court justice and a court clerk, appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court order in a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 granting petitioner landlords' motion for an order directing defendants to issue a warrant for the eviction of their tenants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlords brought the N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 proceeding after the municipal court dismissed their action. The landlords refused to obtain an eviction certificate from the Temporary City Housing Rent Commission as required under a newly enacted local law, New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 66 (1947). The landlords had obtained an eviction certificate from the Rent Control Division of the Federal Office of Price Administration before instituting their summary proceeding in the municipal court. The law was nullified because a local law changing a legislative act was prohibited by N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12; New York City, N.Y., Home Rule Law, &sect; 11(2), but the legislation enacted 1948 N.Y. Laws ch. 4. Reversing, the court concluded that the curative law should be given effect on appeal. The landlords' summary proceeding was still pending when the statute was enacted. 1948 N.Y. Laws ch. 4 did not exceed the jurisdiction of the legislature and was valid. The local law was not preempted by federal law. Under New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 66, the landlords had to obtain an eviction certificate from the local agency before they could obtain a warrant for eviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - landlord and tenant - rent regulation - (1) Local Law No. 66 of 1947 of City of New York (Administrative Code, &sect; U41-7.0), as validated by State (L. 1948, ch. 4), requires landlords to obtain certificate from city rent commission in &quot;all pending and future eviction proceedings&quot;; petition of landlords, who had obtained final order of dispossess, for order under article 78 of Civil Practice Act to compel Municipal Court to issue warrant should be dismissed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  - (2) validating act constitutional - (3) eviction certificate issued to landlords by former Federal Office of Price Administration merely license to resort to remedies in State courts - (4) Federal Housing and Rent Acts of 1947 and 1948 do not prohibit local complementary legislation; State-adopted local law's requirement of certificate does not conflict with, but aids, Federal act - (5) order of Special Term, affirmed by Appellate Division, directing issuance of warrant, reversed on basis of such subsequent enactment; since no warrant issued when validating act passed, summary proceedings still pending.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Local Law No. 66 of 1947 of the City of New York (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; U41-7.0, eff. Sept. 17, 1947) bars removal, except for nonpayment of rent, of an apartment tenant in the city unless a certificate of the existence of one or more specified grounds for eviction is obtained from the temporary city housing rent commission.  The local law has been validated by a State statute (L. 1948, ch. 4, eff. Feb. 3, 1948) and expressly applies &quot;to all pending and future eviction proceedings&quot;.  Landlords in summary proceedings have been granted a final order of dispossess&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with issuance of warrant stayed.  In the present proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, the landlords' petition for an order to compel the Municipal Court to issue a warrant of dispossess should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Even if the local law were not a legitimate exercise of city power, the curative statute (L. 1948, ch. 4) is constitutional.  It validates what the Legislature might have authorized in the first place and it does not incorporate by mere reference one statutory provision into another (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 16) nor is it contrary to the principle of city home rule (art. IX, &sect; 11).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  An eviction certificate which the landlords had formerly obtained from the Federal Office of Price Administration, pursuant to the then existing requirement of Federal statute, merely authorized resort to any remedies open to them in the State courts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 (U.S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 1881 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) and that of 1948 (Public Law 464, 80th Cong.) contain no prohibition against local complementary legislation, though such a prohibition formerly appeared in the Price Control Extension Act of 1946 (60 U.S. Stat. 664, 671). &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The requirement of the State-adopted local law, that a landlord submit to the local administrative body the question of his right to possession, does not conflict with the letter or the policy of the Federal act but rather aids in its enforcement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Special Term granted the landlords' petition to compel issuance of a warrant, and the Appellate Division affirmed; but at that time the curative statute (L. 1948, ch. 4, eff. Feb. 3, 1948) had not yet been enacted.  The statute may be given effect, at least as of its effective date, on this appeal and the orders below reversed.  The summary proceeding was still pending on February 3, 1948, since no warrant was ever issued.  </SPAN></P>

The milk dealer sought to establish an additional site and claimed that the denial violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Respondent Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York issued the denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealer, whose products were sold in interstate commerce, owned three milk distribution plants within the State. Its application for a license to construct a fourth facility was denied under N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 257. The Commissioner concluded that the plant would have tended to destroy competition. The supreme court upheld the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the Commissioner's decision did not violate the Commerce Clause because it did not constitute a prohibited interference with interstate commerce. It did not prevent, obstruct, or burden interstate commerce. Rather, the license denial was an incidental burden on a local business and did not essay to regulate or restrain the shipment of the dealer's products into other states or the price at which it was sold. The Commissioner's decision was permissible regulation of local business within the residuum of power in the State to make laws governing matters of local concern which in some measure affected interstate commerce. The court also held that the decision did not conflict with regulations promulgated under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 671 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture - milk control - (1) petitioner milk dealer having two receiving plants in State for milk which it sold outside State, sought license for third plant in same vicinity; Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets concluded new plant might tend to deprive local market of milk, lead to destructive competition and would be contrary to public interest; denial of license proper - (2) commissioner in denying license dealt with situation essentially local and any burden therefrom on interstate commerce&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deemed only incidental - (3) no conflict between licensing of local dealers and Federal control under Federal milk order No. 4 governing petitioner in foreign State - (4) Agriculture and Markets Law (&sect; 258-c) forbids such license if it would tend to destructive competition and be contrary to public interest; sufficient basis for findings of commissioner to that effect.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Petitioner, operating milk receiving plants at two places near the eastern border of New York State, applied for an extension of its milk dealer's license so as to operate a third plant in the same vicinity. It was shown that petitioner receives milk from producers, tests, cools and ships it, without processing, to the Boston marketing area and the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets has found that the new plant would serve the convenience of petitioner and its suppliers and would enable petitioner to divert from its other plants milk arriving there which has been found difficult to handle; that it would enable petitioner to take on new producers, but that other dealers nearby have facilities for handling more milk than they are getting.  The commissioner concluded that the opening of another plant and taking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of milk now delivered to other dealers would tend to reduce the volume of the other dealers, thus increasing milk handling costs there, that there would be a tendency to deprive local markets of their milk, that all producers had outlets for their milk, and that it would tend to destructive competition in a market adequately served and would not be in the public interest. A determination denying petitioner's application was proper.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Petitioner's whole business, present and proposed, is interstate in character and it insists that the commissioner's order constitutes a prohibited interference with interstate commerce since it obstructs or burdens the transmission of goods.  The determination here does not, as petitioner contends, prohibit, but is merely a permissible regulation of local business with which the State is authorized to deal and any interference with the free flow of interstate commerce is only incidental. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  There is no conflict between the order and the Federal control set up by Federal milk order No. 4, issued under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, which regulates milk sold in interstate commerce in the Boston area and which is valid as to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioner and its business.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  An argument that the determination is unreasonable and unsupported by evidence is without merit.  The statute (Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 258-c) forbids the issuance of a license unless the commissioner is satisfied that it will not tend to destructive competition in a market adequately served and that the issuance of the license is in the public interest. There was a basis for the commissioner's findings.  </SPAN></P>

Laws 314, of the space in the landlord's office building at an amount 17 1/2 percent above the June 1, 1944, rental value of such space.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal involved the construction and application of the Business Rent Law, 1945 N.Y. Laws 314, which fixed rents within certain parameters as a response to a housing and office shortage because of the war. The landlord attempted to increase his rents by almost 50 percent and the supreme court at special term allowed a uniform rent increase of 17 1/2 percent, which was affirmed on appeal. The court agreed and stated that property owners might suffer unfairly if rents were frozen in a period when costs of goods and services were rising. Accordingly, provision was made for revising rents upward to meet those exigencies. But such increases were to be limited to compensating landlords for increased costs of operation resulting from war conditions. Here, the landlord charged an item of depreciation, but could not prove such depreciation. The court found that the conclusion was clear that depreciation could not be considered a cost within the meaning of the Business Rent Law. The phrase &quot;cost of maintenance and operation&quot; in that statute was confined to sums actually paid out or incurred.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and tenant - rent regulation - reasonable rent - (1) depreciation properly excluded in determining &quot;reasonable&quot; rent of business property under Business Rent Law - (2) &quot;cost of maintenance and operation&quot; must be considered but specific items included and excluded by statute suggest restrictive content for phrase - (3) such phrase to be confined to sums actually paid out or incurred - (4) no actual depreciation shown here; allowance for theoretical depreciation unwarranted - (5) in absence of actual depreciation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no constitutional question as to confiscatory nature of statute exists - (6) same is true as to claim of discrimination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Pursuant to the Business Rent Law (L. 1945, ch. 314) petitioner landlord sought an order of the Supreme Court authorizing such further increase in rentals of its business property in the city of New York as is &quot;reasonable&quot; according to the formula provided by the statute (&sect; 4) which sanctions a net annual return equal to 6% of the &quot;fair value&quot; of the property.  In the determination of such reasonable rental, annual depreciation of the property was properly excluded as an item of petitioner's costs of maintenance and operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The statute provides that in such determination &quot;due consideration shall be given to the cost of maintenance and operation of the entire property * * * including amount paid for taxes * * * but excluding amortization or interest paid or accrued on any incumbrances&quot;.  The explicit inclusion of taxes as an item of cost and the express exclusion of continuing fixed charges, such as interest and amortization, suggest a restrictive content for the phrase &quot;cost of maintenance and operation&quot;.  Depreciation not specifically included as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such a cost should not be so treated unless, having in mind the basic anti-inflationary aim of the statute, a reasonable construction requires that result.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The increases authorized by the statute were intended to be limited to compensating landlords for increased costs of operation resulting from war conditions and however depreciation may be treated as an accounting item in other situations, it may not be considered a cost within the meaning of the statute.  The phrase &quot;cost of maintenance and operation&quot; is to be confined to sums actually paid out or incurred.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Petitioner offered no evidence of actual depreciation, none being available, and an allowance for theoretical depreciation would not be warranted.  One of petitioner's own witnesses testified that there had been no depreciation in value of petitioner's building since 1942.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The statute is not confiscatory and, therefore, unconstitutional, if it fails to give the landlord the benefit of theoretical depreciation even though actually there be none.  A contention that in such case the return on the property is only 5.23% instead of the 6% allowed by statute is answered by the fact that, since depreciation is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not to be treated as a cost, the determination actually allows petitioner a return of 6%.  Moreover, until petitioner can show that 5.23% is so low a return as to be beyond the power of the Legislature to authorize, no constitutional problem arises.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Nor is there anything discriminatory in the fact that fully depreciated property derives a full return of 6% while property not fully depreciated receives less.  It may not be held as a matter of constitutional law that a landlord is entitled to have an otherwise reasonable rent increased by an allowance for theoretical depreciation. </SPAN></P>

Prior to the time when the president became a principal of the company, the owner's equipment was intermingled with equipment used in other productions. At trial, there was a discrepancy as to whether the owner requested that his equipment be segregated at some point. Eventually, the owner demanded his equipment, which he was unable to take possession of because the company was using it in other productions. The owner filed a complaint seeking the return of his equipment and damages. A hearing was held pursuant to an order to show cause why an order of seizure should not have been entered. An order of seizure was entered. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. Procedural due process was followed in the case because the owner furnished adequate security and a showing of the validity of the claim was made. Therefore, a prompt subsequent adversary hearing after sequestration would have been sufficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant filed an application for benefits and was ruled ineligible by the Commissioner. That decision was reversed by a referee and the claimant received benefits retroactive to the initial decision and continued to draw benefits thereafter. The Board reversed the referee's decision and sustained the ineligibility determination. The claimant did not appeal from the Board's decision. The Commissioner then issued a determination that the claimant had been overpaid all the benefits received and that he had to repay those benefits. The referee sustained this determination, and the Board adopted this decision. On appeal, the court reversed the Board's decision. The court held that pending an appeal to the Board, the Commissioner could not have withheld benefits from the claimant because there was no enforceable statutory provision allowing it. Also, there was no effective statutory provision which would directly permit recoupment of benefits paid pending an appeal to the Board. N.Y.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Industrial Commissioner has no right under the Labor Law to recover unemployment benefits which were paid to claimant prior to reversal by the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board of a referee's decision awarding such benefits.  A Federal court has declared unconstitutional subdivision 1 of section 598 of the Labor Law, which suspends payment of benefits awarded by a referee pending appeal to the board within 20 days and, upon reversal by the courts of a board decision, allows recovery of any benefits paid thereunder. Subdivision 2 of section 598 of the Labor Law becomes operative to allow recovery of benefits which have been paid upon a referee's decision notwithstanding subdivision 1, only where such payment has resulted from a determination by the Secretary of Labor that subdivision 1 is unlawful.  Accordingly, the commissioner could neither suspend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  benefits pending appeal of the referee's decision nor recover payment of such benefits absent a determination by the Secretary of Labor, which determination has not been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a common-law right of action exists in favor of the State to recover erroneously paid benefits and although the claimant has not shown that such action would constitute a denial of equal protection or violate Federal statute, no return of benefits awarded by a referee should be required, as in the case of benefits awarded by the commissioner and recovered under section 597 of the Labor Law, where there is no bad faith, false representation or concealment of facts.  To require recovery of nonfraudulently obtained benefits awarded by a referee, while disallowing recovery of such benefits if awarded by the commissioner, would constitute a class preference and, in any event, would constitute a denial of equal protection if ordered without a fact-finding hearing equivalent to that provided under section 597.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, the decision of the board ordering recovery of benefits paid to the claimant is arbitrary and capricious, since it is erroneously based upon subdivision 2 of section 598 of the Labor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The claimant may not now appeal from the decision of the board that the original payment of benefits was erroneous.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, school districts and city boards of education, disputed decisions of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Ulster County (New York), which converted a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 into an action for a declaratory judgment and granted various relief declaratory of the rights and relationships among 17 school districts and social services agencies. The issue was who had to pay for education of children transferred to foster homes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One school district refused to admit foster children into its schools until their tuition was paid either by the school district where each child resided before he was removed to the school district or by the welfare agency responsible for his support and maintenance. On appeal, the court held that under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3202(5), as amended by 1973 N.Y. Laws 867 and 1974 N.Y. Laws 919, liability for tuition costs was imposed upon welfare agencies only when they had been directly subjected to such costs prior to January 1, 1974. The intent was to provide relief to those districts receiving the foster children. The court construed the word &quot;pupil&quot; in &sect; 3202(5) to mean &quot;child&quot; in fixing a school district's liability. A denial of summary judgment in one school district's case was proper, because the lower court's judgment did not fix the tuition liability of any party. Although boards of education had standing to challenge the enforceability of &sect; 3202(5), the statute was not unconstitutional. However, because the lower court improperly read into &sect; 3202(5) a rebuttable procedural presumption, the judgment had to be modified to eliminate that part of the judgement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 3202 (subd 5, par a) of the Education Law provides that &quot;The cost of instruction of pupils placed in family homes at board by a social services district or a state department or agency shall be borne by the school district in which each such pupil resided at the time the social services district or state department or agency assumed responsibility for the support and maintenance of such pupil; provided, however, that such cost of instruction shall continue to be borne while such pupil remains under the age of twenty-one years, by any social services district or state department or agency which assumed responsibility for tuition costs for any such pupil prior to January one, nineteen hundred seventy-four.&quot; Special Term properly determined that, under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this statute, social services agencies are responsible for all tuition costs if they had assumed responsibility for such costs prior to January 1, 1974; and where there has been no such assumption, the school district in which such pupil resided at the time he became a public charge is ultimately liable for the tuition costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A declaration that, as to any child who became a foster child prior to January 1, 1974, tuition costs are to be borne solely by the appropriate welfare agency responsible for the general support of the infant prior to that date would be an improper interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That there had been no assumption of tuition costs by welfare agencies prior to 1974 is not established in the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statute does not impose liability for tuition upon the school district of residence at the time the child first became a pupil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A declaratory judgment action is proper here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A class action was also properly maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Yonkers Board of Education and New York City have standing to challenge the validity of the statute.  Subordinate governmental entities may challenge the enforceability of State statutes that directly affect the private property or tax funds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The statute does not result in an arbitrary allocation of the fiscal burdens of educating foster children with no rational relationship to a legitimate State interest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Vlandis v Kline</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 412 U.S. 441, distinguished.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The failure of the Legislature to provide a mechanism whereby school districts which must ultimately bear the educational costs would have an opportunity to be heard on the issue of where an infant will be placed in foster care does not violate concepts of procedural due process and there has been no denial of equal protection.  Boards of education and school districts are agents of the State for the raising of funds to provide for education and those funds are public funds collected for the State-wide interest in education and become public property for that purpose and subject to the will of the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Special Term erred in declaring that it would be presumed that the school district in which the infant resided immediately before his transfer to the receiving district is the entity responsible for tuition payments to such receiving district.  The appropriate tuition is to be determined pursuant to a formula to be established&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Commissioner of Education.  In establishing such formulas, the Commissioner of Education would also have the jurisdiction necessary to determine which governmental entities should bear the tuition costs.  There is, therefore, no necessity to impose a procedural presumption.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants physicians sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York) in favor of respondents, state official and others, in an action to declare that the Medicaid reimbursement allowance paid to methadone maintenance clinics for methadone maintenance treatments of indigent patients was constitutionally confiscatory and discriminatory and to enjoin the enforcement of certain regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Methadone administration by physicians for the treatment of heroin addiction was subject to Medicaid allowances in New York State and city. The maximum amount of such payments was determined by state and city health departments in collaboration with social service agencies of the city and state. The physicians alleged in the instant action that they were discriminated against because the Medicaid allowance of $ 4 per visit was less than the $ 6 per visit paid to privately owned clinics outside of New York City. The trial court held that the methadone maintenance rate paid by New York City violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and enjoined the state official and others from enforcing certain regulations. On appeal, the court found that the lower payment did not constitute unconstitutional discrimination because the city's health agencies had the right to fix what they deemed to be a reasonable Medicaid allowance in the light of the services rendered by the physicians. The court also found that the appropriate remedy for review of Medicaid allowances claimed to be unreasonable or contrary to law was a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher was charged with insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher based upon physical abuse of students. A hearing was held by a hearing panel pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3020-a, which found the teacher innocent of all charges except the use of excessive force. The hearing panel recommended that the teacher be reinstated to his position immediately, subject to the loss of five days' pay. The board, upon its review of the hearing of the transcript, found the teacher guilty of excessive use of force and insubordination in violating district policy regarding corporal punishment of students. The board dismissed the teacher. On appeal, the court modified the board's determination by annulling so much of it as found the teacher guilty of offenses in addition to those recommended by the hearing panel, and remitted the matter with directions to reinstate the teacher with appropriate back salary, subject to the loss of five days' pay. The court held that the charge of excessive force could not be relied upon under N.Y. Educ.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- insubordination -- use of excessive force -- decision of board of education did not properly set forth reasons and factual basis for its determination dismissing tenured teacher for insubordination -- in addition, decision was not supported by substantial evidence, but was silent as to proceedings before hearing panel despite requirement that it must be based solely on record of those proceedings</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- there was substantial evidence to support charge that teacher used excessive force on student; since petitioner might not be removed for use of such force, matter is remitted to board to reinstate teacher with back pay, subject to loss of five days' pay for use of excessive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The decision of respondent board of education did not properly set forth, as required by the regulations (8 NYCRR 82.11), the reasons and the factual basis for its determination dismissing petitioner, a tenured teacher, for insubordination. The board had stated its own conclusory observations in finding petitioner guilty of using excessive physical force on students on two occasions thereby violating the board's policy regarding corporal punishment of students although petitioner had been warned with respect thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In addition, the board's decision of guilt of insubordination was not supported by substantial evidence. The decision is silent as to the proceedings before the hearing panel despite the requirement that it must be based solely on the record of those proceedings.  While the findings of the panel are not conclusive on the board, its report is part of the record and is entitled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to some weight on the question of substantial evidence in the light of the record as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There was substantial evidence to support the charge that petitioner had used excessive force when he pulled a strip of hair from the head of a student.  Since petitioner might not be removed for the use of such force (Education Law, &sect; 3012, subd 2), the matter is remitted to the board to reinstate petitioner with back pay, subject to a loss of five days' pay as a penalty on the finding of guilt on the charge of the use of excessive force. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the sixth degree, which was a Class D felony. The court sentenced defendant as a second felony offender. Defendant appealed, contending that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06, as applied to him, was an ex post facto law and, therefore, unconstitutional, because he received a heavier sentence as a second felony offender and his predicate felony conviction was obtained prior to the enactment of &sect; 70.06. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) these circumstances did not render the statute an ex post facto law as applied to defendant because the increased punishment was imposed for the present crime only and was not an additional penalty for the prior offense; (2) the legislature had the power to define criminal offenses and to prescribe the punishment therefor; and (3) the legislature was justified in not differentiating between more and less serious felonies in defining a &quot;predicate felony.&quot; The fact that defendant may have been unaware of the provisions of &sect; 70.06 did not excuse him from the sentence of imprisonment imposed pursuant thereto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, the People of the State of New York, challenged judgments from the Supreme Court, Onondaga County (New York), which dismissed indictments against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After indictments against defendants were returned by a grand jury, defendants moved, among other things, for a declaration that N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 70-a under which the indictments were found was unconstitutional and a determination that the subpoenas issued by the People were invalid for failure to comply with N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 73. Under stipulation between counsel and the court only the constitutionality of N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 70-a and the question of compliance with N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 73 were argued and decided, and the remaining aspects of the several motions were reserved for later consideration. On appeal, the court held that since the arguments on the motion regarding N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 70-a focused on the constitutionality of the statute and not on the facts, which could have supported its application, the matter was remitted to afford the parties an opportunity to develop jurisdictional facts. Likewise, the court reversed the order of the trial court regarding the fair procedure rights granted by N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 73 and remitted the matter for further proceedings after the People conceded that an Organized Crime Task Force did not comply with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant railroad appealed from the order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which enjoined a taking of the city's property without just compensation, based on a finding that the Landmark Preservation Law (LPL), N.Y. City Admin. Code ch. 8-A, was unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroad sought to preserve a historic railroad terminal as a landmark. The city prevailed on objections that the application of the LPL was unconstitutionally applied. On appeal, the court found that the city failed to meet the burden of showing that the LPL was not valid or that there was a compensable taking. The city's exercise of the police power to regulate the private use of property was not unlimited. In the instant case, the disputed landmark property was not devoted to a charitable purpose, and the city did not claim it could not be used for its prime function as a railroad terminal. The validity of the LPL, as applied to the disputed terminal did not depend on a showing that the landmark parcel would be undiminished in any degree by the resulting restrictions. The test was whether it would deprive the individual property owner of all beneficial use of his property, which did not occur here.</SPAN></P>

The denial by the Landmarks Preservation Commission of the City of New York of a certificate of appropriateness for construction of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tower over Grand Central Station is not an unconstitutional application of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Law (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch 8-A), since the regulation is important to the public good, reasonably related to such end and the plaintiffs have not shown that such a burden has been imposed as would constitute a compensable taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of establishing, not hardship, but, that there will be a deprivation of all beneficial use of the property.  There is no claim that the property cannot be used for its prime function as a railroad terminal. The financial statements submitted by the plaintiffs, which show an operating deficit, fail to segregate railroad operating expenses from real estate operating expenses and there is no imputation therein of rental value to the space used for railroad purposes.  There is no satisfactory showing of an inability to increase commercial income by putting underutilized space to productive use or that unused development rights could not have been profitably transferred to nearby sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Landmarks Preservation Law does not unconstitutionally discriminate against the plaintiffs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by rendering them ineligible for hardship relief by virtue of their partial tax exemption, since the statute authorizes relief in some cases without precluding judicial relief in others.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff inmates brought an action under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, that sought equitable remedies for the failure of defendants, county officers, sheriff and prison doctor, to provide adequate or any medical treatment to them during the period of their incarceration. The Supreme Court at Special Term in Monroe County (New York) granted the doctor's motion for summary judgment and the inmates appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmates' complaint set forth several allegations of inadequate medical treatment of female inmates as a class and individual allegations as to the six named inmates. The trial court granted summary judgment to the doctor and held that the claim against the doctor failed to state a cause of action under &sect; 1983 and that the inmates' failure to file a notice of claim under the N.Y. General Municipal Law was a fatal defect. On appeal, the court found the notice of claim was not necessary to bring the action because the complaint sought primarily equitable relief. The court found the allegations of inadequate medical treatment stated a cause of action pursuant to &sect; 1983. The complaint alleged a clear pattern of delayed treatment, callous disregard of severe physical symptoms, failure to conduct physical examinations or other tests, and general indifference to requests of medical care sufficient to establish a claim for relief under &sect; 1983. The inmates' allegations established a pattern of conduct that could demonstrate a willful refusal or failure to provide adequate medical care to the inmates incarcerated in the jail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- notice of claim -- class action -- treatment of prisoners -- inmates of Monroe County Jail commenced class action alleging lack of adequate medical treatment at jail and liability of defendant physician, employed by county as official physician of jail -- action brought under United States Code (tit 42, &sect; 1983), not tort action -- notice of claim provisions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Municipal Law ( &sect; 50-e</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) not applicable -- cause of action stated under Federal Civil Rights Act (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983) -- record insufficient to determine whether physician has right to indemnification and defense by county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Six female inmates in the Monroe County Jail commenced a class action, alleging a lack of adequate medical treatment at the jail and the liability therefor of the defendant physician, employed by the County of Monroe as the official physician of the County Jail. The complaint sets forth numerous allegations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of inadequate medical treatment or facilities which affect all members of plaintiffs' class similarly situated.  Additionally, each of the plaintiffs has alleged individual facts to show the inadequacy of medical treatment. Plaintiffs seek equitable remedies of injunction and affirmative relief for the class as well as monetary damages for the named plaintiffs.  The instant action was commenced pursuant to section 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code, which does not describe a tort action. Where the relief demanded is primarily equitable in nature and the monetary relief demanded is merely incidental to the equitable relief sought, the notice of claim provisions of the General Municipal Law ( &sect; 50-e) do not apply.  A notice of claim is not a necessary condition precedent to bringing this suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Applying the standards applicable in determining whether a cause of action under the Federal Civil Rights Act (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1983) is stated establishes that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient.  Plaintiffs have alleged conduct on the part of defendant physician and other prison officials which raises questions as to the adequacy and willfulness of the treatment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  afforded the female prisoners at the County Jail. A pattern of delayed treatment, callous disregard of severe physical symptoms, failure to conduct physical examinations or other tests and general indifference to requests of medical care establish a claim for relief under the Federal statute.  The complaint states a claim for relief under the above section 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The record before the court is insufficient to rule on the question of whether the physician has a right under the General Municipal Law to indemnification and a defense by the County of Monroe against the claims arising out of the complaint.  </SPAN></P>

After the wife rejected defendant, defendant went home to obtain his shotgun and returned to the ball park where he shot his wife twice at close range. On appeal, defendant argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25, which defined the affirmative defense of extreme emotional distress, was unconstitutional. The court concluded that defendant was not injured by the alleged unconstitutional provision of the statute because he was successful in his affirmative defense. The jury found defendant guilty of murder reduced to manslaughter in the first degree because defendant was acting under extreme emotional disturbance. Consequently, the court did not reach the constitutional question raised by defendant. There was no error in the trial court's refusal to charge the jury on manslaughter in the second degree because the evidence did not support the charge. There was substantial evidence to support the jury's findings that defendant's shots caused the wife's death and that defendant was sane when he shot her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant cable company sought review from judgments of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), which dismissed an application by the cable company to annul a regulation promulgated by respondent, the New York State Commission on Cable Television, and granted a cross motion by the commission for summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action and declared N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 817(2) to be constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cable company brought this action for a declaratory judgment attacking the constitutionality of &sect; 817 and to enjoin the commission from enforcing said statute, to declare the cable company entitled to a refund of moneys paid under General Orders Nos. 3 and 4 and to order the commission to refund such moneys. Special Term granted the commission's cross motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action declaring that &sect; 817 was constitutional and granted their motion to dismiss. The cable company's primary contention was that the assessment imposed by &sect; 817 on the entire gross receipts derived from its operations within the State violated U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, in that such assessment failed to allocate between the interstate and intrastate aspects of cable television operations. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the cable company was in operation prior to the start of the applicable time and they could not challenge the validity of General Order No. 3 since the time to have done so had long since expired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder. In its charge to the jury, the trial court instructed on murder, manslaughter, first degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.20, and manslaughter second degree as defined by &sect; 125.15. The trial court instructed that extreme emotional disturbance was an affirmative defense and that the burden of proving such a defense by a preponderance of the evidence rested upon defendant. On appeal, the court found that under the instructions, defendant was required to establish extreme emotional disturbance, and that defendant bore the risk of nonpersuasion. Based upon a United States Supreme Court holding that due process required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of heat of passion when the issue was properly presented, the court reversed the conviction. The court held that the decision applied retroactively, and that the statute under which defendant was convicted was unconstitutional because defendant bore the burden to establish the existence of extreme emotional disturbance. Thus, defendant was entitled to a new trial. The court also found that the evidence did not fit into the elements of criminally negligent homicide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mullaney v Wilbur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (421 U.S. 684), holding that, where a defendant in a homicide prosecution asserted that the homicide was committed in the heat of passion, due process required that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not committed in the heat of passion, the provision of the New York murder statute (Penal Law, &sect; 125.25, prior to L 1974, ch 367, eff Sept. 1, 1974) which makes the claim that a killing was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance an affirmative defense, with the burden of proof upon the defendant to establish the existence of extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence, is unconstitutional as violative of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decision in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mullaney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case must be given fully retroactive effect, and, therefore, applies to the trial of a defendant who was tried and convicted prior to the date it was rendered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the instant case, involving a defendant convicted of murder under section 125.25 (subd 1) of the Penal Law, prior to its September 1, 1974 revision, the evidence relating to his mental state at the time of the killing required a charge by the court that, to establish his guilt of murder, the People had the burden of proving he was not acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance. Furthermore, the court, which had charged manslaughter in the first degree under subdivision 1 of section 125.20 of the Penal Law, should also have charged manslaughter in the first degree under subdivision 2 of that section.  However, it is not conceivable that defendant, who plunged a 7-inch dagger into the deceased five times, at least twice in vital areas, failed to perceive the risk of death which might ensue from his conduct, and, therefore, there was no error in a refusal by the court to charge criminally negligent homicide under section 125.10 of the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Immediately following the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prosecutor's cross-examination of a defense character witness, defense counsel asked her if she had ever heard anything bad about defendant, and the court refused to allow her to answer.  Her testimony concerned defendant's reputation in his local community for peaceableness, a relevant and proper query in a homicide trial.  The court was in error in ruling that a question concerning prior bad acts with respect to peaceableness was not permissible.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 149, N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 63(2), and N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 27.</SPAN></P>

The landowner commenced a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding challenging the validity of the fee schedule. The trial court determined that the proceeding could continue in the form of an action for a declaratory judgment, but denied the application. On appeal, the court modified the order, and, as so modified, affirmed it. The court held that the trial court properly determined that the action could continue as a declaratory judgment action. The court further held that the village board had the power to supervise and regulate connections into its water mains under N.Y. Village Law &sect; 11-1112. It could require the obtaining of a permit and could impose a fee as a regulatory measure. However, to the extent that fees charged were exacted for revenue purposes or to offset the cost of general governmental functions, they were invalid as an unauthorized tax.

Moreover, the exclusive means to recoup the cost of improving the water system are general taxation, special benefit assessment and water rents (Village Law, &sect;&sect; 11-1108, 11-1118) and the fees charged herein do not come within those charges.  Accordingly, the fee schedule violates section 2 (subd [c]) of article IX of the State Constitution as a local ordinance which conflicts with a State statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A hearing must be held to determine, on all relevant evidence, whether the fee schedule may be upheld as a regulatory measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fixing of fees for municipal services is a legislative act, particularly where no provision has been made for notice and a hearing, and, accordingly, an article 78 proceeding was an inappropriate vehicle to test the constitutionality of the enactment.  However, the proceeding can continue as an action for a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>

Part 2 of the plan pertained to incumbents with 1 year or more of permanent service in a grade 14 position. The plan provided that such an incumbent may have been advanced in a direct line in the discretion of the appointing officer, without examination. The employees' principal contention was that the latter part of the plan was constitutionally prohibited. The court held that part two of the plan was an impermissible method of promoting civil service employees without examination under the guise of reclassification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A teacher was discharged allegedly for restraining a student, fighting with a student, writing a letter to a newspaper, failing to answer the board of education's questions about the letter, and failing to prepare permanent lesson plans. A hearing panel found no evidence of crimes or misconduct and recommended against discharge. The board discharged the teacher, relying on the five-year limitations period in &sect; 3020-a to consider the fight with the student. The court found that the limitations period was discriminatory because a similar period found in &sect; 2573(8) was only three years. The court thus applied only a three-year period to considering whether the earlier fight constituted conduct unbecoming a teacher and found it to be barred. The court further found (1) that writing a letter to the newspaper was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, (2) that the teacher had not failed to respond to questions about his letter, (3) that the teacher had not failed to prepare lesson plans, (4) that the board's written policy allowed teachers to use corporal punishment on students, and (5) that the teacher did not strike the student that he was restraining.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In February, 1974 a tenured teacher was charged with using excessive physical force on students, insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher, based on incidents which occurred in October, 1969 and December, 1973, when he applied physical force to students, despite warnings from his building principal not to physically discipline students, and with insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher, based on his writing a letter to a newspaper and his alleged delay in answering a superior's questions in regard to the letter, and based on his failure to prepare permanent lesson plans for a substitute.  The matter was submitted to a hearing panel pursuant to section 3020-a of the Education Law, and it found that all charges and specifications should be dismissed.  In its decision, the board of education referred to the transcript of the record and the hearing panel's report, and found the teacher guilty of all charges, upon findings that all of the factual specifications were established.  The board's determination is annulled and the matter is remitted to it, with directions to reinstate the teacher with appropriate back salary less a credit to the board for all&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  earnings he may have had from other employment during his period of suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 3012 (subd 2) of the Education Law controls as to causes for removal in this case, and excessive force is not listed therein.  Assuming that the charge of excessive force might be an allegation of a crime, and thus a valid, independent charge, the record is devoid of substantial evidence that the teacher committed such a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the charges of insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher might be based on excessive use of force, there is no substantial evidence that either the October, 1969 incident or the December, 1973 incident involved conduct on the part of the teacher which constituted insubordination, nor any substantial evidence that the December, 1973 incident involved conduct on his part unbecoming a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The October, 1969 incident occurred over four years before the charges against the teacher were instituted.  Under section 2573 (subd 8) of the Education Law, which is applicable to teachers in city school districts, no charges of misconduct may be brought pursuant to that section more than three years after the occurrence of the misconduct, except in the case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a crime, while section 3020-a (subd 1) of that law, which is not upon its face concerned with any particular section pursuant to which charges might be filed and is simply a time limitation, provides that, except as provided in section 2573 (subd 8), no charges shall be brought more than five years after the occurrence of the alleged misconduct, except when the charge is of misconduct constituting a crime when committed.  There is no apparent reason for having a three-year limitation in regard to teachers in city school districts and not imposing the same limitation in regard to teachers of large central school districts.  The limiting language of section 3020-a should be strictly construed and, given such a strict construction, a limitation of time as affected by the importation in section 3020-a (subd 1) of section 2573 (subd 8) is, in fact, three years from the date the alleged incident occurred, except when the charge constituted a crime when committed.  Accordingly, the board erred, as a matter of law, when it rejected a claim by the teacher of laches or staleness, and the 1969 incident may not be considered substantial evidence of conduct unbecoming a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The record&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contains no substantial evidence which would support a finding of insubordination in regard to lesson plans, nor could this specification rationally support a conclusion of conduct unbecoming a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. As to the specification relating to the letter which the teacher wrote to the newspaper, the record does not contain substantial evidence to sustain a finding that the proof as to that specification constituted proof of insubordination or conduct unbecoming a teacher. And, as a matter of law, that specification would constitute an indirect attempt by the board to abridge the teacher's freedom of speech.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon application of respondent district attorney, the family court signed an ex parte order directing the district attorney to employ an assistant county attorney to provide representation to persons petitioning in the family court and which further ordered the county auditor and the chief fiscal auditor to pay compensation to such assistant out of county funds. The family court denied the motion filed by the county auditor and the chairman on the ground that they were not proper parties. On appeal, the court found that the family court did not have the authority to order the hiring of an assistant county attorney. In any event, the fact that the county auditor and the chairman were not parties to the original application was not controlling. The challenged order purported to bind the county auditor in his official role. It was of no consequence that he might not have been civilly liable for compliance with the family court order since he had been ordered to perform an act that he contended he did not have the authority to perform. Thus, he had the responsibility with respect to the disposition of county funds, and was sufficiently interested in the case to attain standing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was not violative of the equal protection clause because it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state objective. However, the court found that the trial court erred in holding that it was compelled to award counsel fees to the ex-wife without regard to the financial circumstances of the parties, as required under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant town sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court in Monroe County (New York) adjudging that the Town of Brighton, N.Y., Sign Ordinance and the Town of Brighton, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 42.29 were void and unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff advertising company's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The advertising company successfully challenged a sign and zoning ordinance, the application of which gave the advertising company a period of 34 months during which it was permitted to maintain a non-accessory outdoor advertising billboard after adoption of the ordinance which prohibited such billboard. The evidence established that the billboard that was the subject of the action was located 25 feet from the pavement of a heavily travelled four-lane highway that was the major route for traffic going south from the town. The billboard was 600 feet from one traffic control signal and 150 feet from another signal. There was testimony by an experienced police officer that the billboard created a traffic safety hazard by virtue of its location. Under those circumstances, the application of the ordinances represented a permissible exercise of the police power in the protection of the public safety. The court concluded that the 34-month period during which the billboard was permitted to have remained as a nonconforming use represented a reasonable reconciliation of the public and private interests and an adequate time for amortization of the advertising company's investment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dog owners paid the fee required by N.Y., Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 109 to license their dogs, but did not pay the additional 10 cents required by N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 109-b. The Town Clerk imposed a civil penalty of $ 10 and the dog owners appealed. The town court held that &sect; 109-b was unconstitutional and the State appealed. The trial court reversed the town court and remanded the matter. The dog owners appealed on the basis that the purpose of the statute, to provide funds for the research of dog diseases, violated the Equal Protection Clause.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 109-b of the Agriculture and Markets Law which adds 10 cents to all fees for dog licenses to be used for research into diseases of dogs, does not violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.  Dogs are a specific species of animal which presumably have particular immunities and susceptibilities to various diseases. The Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has found that some diseases affect both men and dogs (&sect; 109-b, subd 1).  Research into dog diseases will benefit dog owners although such research may incidentally benefit owners of other animals. Accordingly, it does not appear that there is any unreasonableness in the classification of dogs as an appropriate base for the tax and, where defendants had tendered the license fee without the additional 10-cent tax, the Town Clerk was empowered to collect a $ 10 civil penalty for harboring an unlicensed dog (&sect; 113).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06.

Penal Law &sect; 70.10 which dealt with persistent felony offenders. Defendant claimed that it was theoretically possible for a second felony offender to receive a longer term of imprisonment than a third or fourth felony offender. The court stated, however, that the legislative scheme was clear. A reasonable construction of the statute did not permit the unconstitutional result defendant posited. Since the only available sentences for a persistent felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.10 were the same as or longer than those imposed upon a second felony offender N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sued to recover damages for personal injuries he suffered in an automobile accident. Defendant moved for summary judgment of dismissal of the complaint upon the ground that under New York's no-fault insurance law, plaintiff had no cause of action against defendant but had to resort solely to a claim against his own insurance carrier. The motion was denied. The court affirmed the denial holding that, although plaintiff did not fall within the purview of N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 673 because his medical expenses did not meet the statutory minimum to maintain an action, plaintiff's allegation in his complaint, supplemented by his bill of particulars and the affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment--that he suffered serious permanent injury to his knee--brought him expressly within N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, health care applicants, brought a proceeding under N.Y.C.P.L.R. art. 78, transferred by order of the Supreme Court, Monroe County (New York), to review an administrative determination that denied an application for medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petitioners, husband and wife, came to New York from Puerto Rico because the wife was suffering from an illness that could not be treated properly in Puerto Rico. The couple brought many of their personal belongings with them to their daughter's home in New York, but at the time of their original application for medical assistance and at the time of the hearing, they still owned a home in Puerto Rico. The wife's treatment was to be for a long and indefinite time. At the hearing, the husband stated that he would prefer to live in Puerto Rico if his wife were not ill. Assistance was denied pursuant to N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 366(1)(b) on the ground that the couple had entered New York for the purpose of obtaining medical assistance. The court reversed and remanded, holding that residence depended upon the applicants' intent to make New York their place of residence, regardless of whether the move was motivated by health reasons. The court noted that the husband's preference as to where he would live under hypothetical circumstances was not determinative of whether he actually intended to remain in New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the denial of medical assistance and remanded for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social services -- medical assistance -- application by petitioners for medical assistance was denied, after hearing, on ground that they were residents of Puerto Rico and had come to New York for purpose of receiving medical assistance -- determination is annulled and matter remanded for new hearing -- primary focus of inquiry at hearing should have been their intent to make New York their place of residence, rather than, as it was, motivation behind their intention -- in view of remand, it is unnecessary to reach question of constitutionality of provision of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 366 of Social Services Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, applicable to persons temporarily in State and not to residents, which prohibits medical assistance to persons who enter State to obtain medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At a hearing held on an application for medical assistance, made by petitioners husband&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and wife within one month of their arrival in Rochester from Puerto Rico, testimony was elicited that they came to New York because petitioner wife was suffering from an illness which could not be properly treated in Puerto Rico; that they owned a home in Puerto Rico but had brought all the personal belongings they could with them, and moved in with a daughter and son-in-law; that, on the day after their arrival, petitioner wife entered a hospital, and that, although she had been discharged from it, they intended to remain and make their home in Rochester because she required continuing treatment for an indefinite time, although, if she was not ill, they would return to Puerto Rico.  Their application was denied on the ground that they were residents of Puerto Rico and had come to New York for the purpose of receiving medical assistance. This determination was centered on their continued ownership of property in Puerto Rico and the admission that they were motivated to move to New York because of petitioner wife's poor health. However, in view of the short time sequence between their arrival in Rochester and the hearing, it is not surprising that they still owned a home in Puerto&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rico, nor was any evidence adduced at the hearing on the issue of what was to become of the home.  And, since the proviso in section 366 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Social Services Law which prohibits medical assistance to persons who enter the State to obtain medical care applies only to persons temporarily in the State and not to residents, the primary focus of inquiry at the hearing should have been petitioners' intent to make New York their place of residence, rather than, as it was, the motivation behind their intention.  The determination is annulled and the matter remanded for a new hearing as to their intent to make Rochester their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the matter is being remanded for a new hearing, it is unnecessary to reach the question of the constitutionality of section 366 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Social Services Law. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff public employee brought a cause of action against defendant state alleging that a provision of a collective bargaining agreement was unconstitutional. The agreement provided for binding arbitration as the method of disposing of challenges to disciplinary action. The Supreme Court of Monroe County (New York) entered a judgment in favor of the employee. The state sought review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The collective bargaining agreement in question was entered into between the state and the representative of the negotiating unit to which the employee belonged. A provision of the agreement provided that arbitration would be the binding method of disposing of challenges to disciplinary action addressed to an employee. The provision removed the employee's option of resorting to the Civil Service Commission or filing a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding in a court. The public employee was a childcare worker at a state training school. The employee filed the action after he was notified of charges and prospective termination of employment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and entered a judgment in favor of the state. The court found that the agreement was voluntarily entered into by the employee's representative and the fact that the employee disagreed with the agreement made it no less binding upon him. If the employee was unsatisfied with his representation, he could have changed his representation or certification. The court found that the employee's waiver of his individual constitutional rights did not violate public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the court entered a judgment in favor of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- disciplinary proceedings -- binding arbitration of disciplinary disputes -- public employee who is in negotiating unit for which Civil Service Employees' Association (CSEA) is designated bargaining agent may not challenge, as violative of his rights to due process and equal protection of laws, collective bargaining agreement executed by State and CSEA, providing for binding arbitration as method of disposing of challenges to disciplinary action and removing, even as option, resort to Civil Service Commission or to court through article 78 proceeding -- CSEA was acting as agent for him, its assent to agreement, voluntarily entered into, was his assent, and, accordingly, he has waived his rights -- such waiver of individual constitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> rights incidental to procedure for removal from employment does not contravene any public policy such that waiver should not be given effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Following the passage of an amendment to section 76 of the Civil Service Law which permitted sections 75 and 76 of that law, prescribing the procedures and remedies available to covered public employees to challenge disciplinary action taken against them, to be replaced by agreements negotiated between the State and employee organizations, the State and the Civil Service Employees' Association (CSEA) executed a collective bargaining agreement which provided for binding arbitration as the method of disposing of challenges to disciplinary action, removing, even as an option, resort to the Civil Service Commission or to the court through an article 78 proceeding.  A public employee who is in a negotiating unit for which CSEA is the designated bargaining agent may not challenge these arbitration provisions on the ground that they violate his rights to due process and equal protection of the laws.  CSEA, as designated bargaining agent for the group of employees in which he was included, was acting as agent for him, its assent to the agreement, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which was voluntarily entered into, was his assent, and, accordingly, he has waived his statutory and constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Such a waiver of individual constitutional rights incidental to a procedure for removal from employment does not contravene any public policy such that the waiver should not be given effect.  On the contrary, the binding arbitration procedures provided for in the agreement advance the public good by providing for resolution of disciplinary disputes in a simpler, more prompt manner than would attend their disposition by one of the methods provided by sections 75 and 76 of the Civil Service Law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), convicting him, after he entered a plea of guilty, of possession of a weapon as a felony subsequent to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant's automobile was pulled over by a police officer for a &quot;routine&quot; license and registration check, defendant handed over to the officer a forged driver's license and was unable to produce a registration for the vehicle. He was subsequently arrested. A loaded revolver was found on his person and drugs were discovered in the vehicle. He filed a motion to suppress the forged license, drugs, and revolver, but the motion was denied. The Court of Appeals subsequently delivered an interpretation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 390 that mandated that the citizenry had the right to not be subject to stops merely at the whims of the police authorities. Defendant contended that this interpretation of the law should be applied retroactively, while the prosecution argued it should have only prospective effect. The court agreed with the prosecution and determined that the new standard should not be applied retroactively because it had no relation to whether or not defendant was in fact guilty of a criminal offense. Therefore, reversal and dismissal of defendant's indictment for failure to suppress the seized evidence was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The 1975 decision of the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ingle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (36 NY2d 413), holding that section 390 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law may not be read to authorize the stopping of a vehicle for a routine traffic check if such stop is gratuitous, arbitrary and without justification or excuse, will not be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applied retroactively. The new standard announced in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ingle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has no relation to the truth-determining process and in no way involves the question of whether a defendant is guilty of a criminal offense, but is designed to safeguard the right of the citizenry not to be subjected to stops at the whims of the police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, town and town board, sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which reversed the town board's decision denying petitioner developer's application to rezone land and remitted the developer's application to the town board for further factual development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding to (1) annul the town board's decision denying the developer's application to rezone land for a shopping center and (2) secure an order requiring the rezoning of the land. The lower court determined that the town board's factual findings were conclusory statements that were arbitrary and unreasonable. It reversed the decision and remitted the developer's application to the town board for further factual development. The town and the town board appealed. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the developer's petition because there was no evidence to support the lower court's determination that the town board's action was arbitrary or discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the developer's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- in article 78 proceeding brought to annul decision of Town Board which refused to rezone petitioner's property to that of shopping center district, petition is dismissed; determination to approve or reject planned unit development (PUD) is legislative, rather than administrative determination -- although board restricted its discretion to approve shopping centers only within previously set up districts, decision to rezone or not to rezone was not, therefore, administrative -- town's PUD procedures not analogous to application for special use permit -- board's determination did not deprive petitioner of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to the Town of Webster Zoning Ordinance and Official Map, land owned by petitioner, a developer of retail&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shopping centers, was placed in a district limited to single family dwellings and various public, religious and agricultural uses.  The Town Board was given authority to establish a planned shopping center district within that district, and petitioner went through the procedure outlined in the ordinance to have the property rezoned.  Ultimately, the Town Board denied the request for intent to rezone. In an article 78 proceeding brought to annul this decision, the petition is dismissed.  The determination to approve or reject a planned unit development (PUD) is a legislative, rather than an administrative determination, and judicial review may only ascertain whether the local legislative body had authority to act as it did under its zoning enabling statute or whether the action is an unconstitutional taking or deprivation of due process or equal protection.  Inasmuch as the Town of Webster ordinance states that the Town Board shall enact the legislation to create the appropriate PUD district, the intent to rezone is a legislative act and must be performed by the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the board restricted its discretion to approve planned shopping centers only within districts set up&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in 1969, it does not follow that the board's secondary decision to rezone or not to rezone was administrative.  The Zoning Ordinance and Master Plan did not limit the district use to shopping centers only since other residential and commercial uses were permitted, as well as public uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The town's PUD procedures are not analogous to an application for a special use permit, which involves only administrative action.  Special use permits usually seek approval for a specified single use on a small parcel, whereas PUD is a multi-use proposal for large scale developments.  The proposed shopping center has a greater impact on the body politic and the community, and a broad determination by the town's legislative body is more appropriate for this task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The board's determination did not deprive petitioner of due process of law by virtue of being an unreasonable exercise of zoning powers.  The burden of proving the legislative zoning decision unreasonable is upon petitioner, and no evidence was produced to support a judicial determination that the board's action was arbitrary or discriminatory. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother challenged an order of the Family Court, Schenectady County (New York), which determined that her minor child was permanently neglected and permanently terminated the mother's custody of the child pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 611, 614.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A child was placed in the care of the county social services department at age two when his mother became a heroin addict. Afterwards the mother was incarcerated most of the time and had no regular contact with the child. She contended that the evidence before the trial court was insufficient to prove permanent neglect under &sect; 611 of the Act or sustain the findings required under &sect; 614 of the Act to justify termination of parental custody. She also claimed that article 6 of the Act was unconstitutional because it did not define the parental conduct that justified termination of custody. In affirming, the court held that the record established that the department had tried to strengthen and encourage the parental relationship but that the mother had not maintained contact with the child or formulated or seriously contemplated any plans for the child's future. Although there was some evidence that the mother had rehabilitated herself and wanted the child, she was arrested between the date of the decision finding the child permanently neglected and the date of the disposition hearing. The statutory requirements for termination did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the finding that the child was permanently neglected and the order terminating permanently the mother's custody of the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and child -- custody of children -- permanently neglected child -- appellant's conduct toward her child has met definition of &quot;permanently neglected child&quot; and Agency carried out its responsibility (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Family Ct Act, &sect; 611</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">); accordingly, appellant's custody of child was properly terminated permanently -- failure of appellant to provide for child physically and financially was result of her own transgressions and purpose of section 611 should not be defeated by negative action -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sections 611, 614 and 622 of Family Court Act</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> are not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The conduct of appellant toward her child has met the definition of a &quot;permanently neglected child&quot; and the Agency, in whose care the child has been, has carried out its responsibility as required by section 611 of the Family Court Act.  Appellant, a heroin addict, has been incarcerated for most&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the time since the child came into the care of the Agency.  Although she overcame her addiction, her incarceration has continued.  While she has been on furlough, parole or not yet convicted, she only had three visits with the child and the record establishes that she has not kept regular contact with the child or the Agency.  The Agency gave her as much encouragement to enter into a continuing parental relationship as her way of life permitted.  Accordingly, appellant's custody of the child was properly terminated permanently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The record does not establish affirmatively that appellant was physically or financially able to provide for the child.  Such failure was the direct result of her own transgressions. Therefore, the purpose of section 611 of the Family Court Act, which speaks affirmatively with respect to the mother's physical and financial ability to provide, should not be defeated by negative action.  The intent of the statute was satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Sections 611, 614 and 622 of the Family Court Act are not unconstitutional because of a failure to define the conduct of a parent and because section 622 does not require adequate weight of the evidence.  The proof required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the statute is for the court to decide.  Due process infirmities are not established.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation (commissioner) appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted plaintiff turtle raiser's motion for a preliminary injunction in his action seeking a declaration that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkt. Law &sect; 358-a did not apply to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The turtle raiser had a farm out of the country where he raised a particular type of turtle and offered their shells and other parts for sale within the State of New York. The raiser brought an action seeking a declaration that &sect; 358-a did not apply to him because he did not sell &quot;wild animal&quot; parts. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction against the commissioner's enforcement of &sect; 358-a against him pending the outcome of the action. The commissioner sought review of that order and the court modified the order by vacating the preliminary injunction. The court held that it was error to have granted the injunction upon a finding that the turtle raiser's interpretation of &sect; 358-a was &quot;not unreasonable&quot; and that therefore he had a fair possibility of success. The court held that the turtle raiser had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, which was essential to the granting of a preliminary injunction. The court noted that the raiser's threat of financial injury was not sufficient to warrant preliminary injunctive relief where the injury was measured against the threat of injury to a public interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's order by vacating the preliminary injunction granted to the turtle raiser pending the outcome of his declaratory judgment action against the commissioner, wherein he sought a determination that a statute prohibiting the sale of certain turtles was not applicable to him.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff, a foreign corporation that raises marine turtles of the family Cheloniidae, was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement of section 358-a of the Agriculture and Markets Law, which states that no part of the skin or body of such wild animals may be sold within New York.  Taking into account plaintiff's interpretation of the statute, that since it expressly prohibits the sale of &quot;wild animal&quot; parts, the sale of turtles raised from eggs is not prohibited, the injunction was granted upon the trial court's finding that plaintiff's interpretation was &quot;not unreasonable&quot; and therefore plaintiff had a &quot;fair probability of success&quot; in the main action. The court failed to adopt the correct standard, which is that before an injunction will issue there must be shown a clear legal and equitable right to the relief demanded, especially where the enforcement of law is involved.  Since defendants' interpretation of the statute, that &quot;wild animals&quot; was not meant to exclude the sale of animals which are by their nature wild merely because they are raised in a man-controlled environment, appears to be more reasonable, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The threat of financial injury to plaintiff is not alone sufficient to warrant preliminary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  injunctive relief where the injury is measured against the threat of injury to a public interest which the Legislature has determined to outweigh commercial interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although it is unlikely that plaintiff will be able to show that its activities are not in violation of the statute, defendants are not entitled to a preliminary injunction against plaintiff since they have an adequate remedy at law pursuant to the enforcement provisions of section 358-a and the penal sanctions of section 41 of the Agriculture and Markets Law.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, tenured teachers of defendant school district, were properly suspended pending the final determination of disciplinary proceedings ( Education Law, &sect; 3020-a) charging them with unwarranted and excessive use of physical force against students.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor and the corporation entered into an agreement whereby the creditor acquired a security interest, later perfected, in all inventory sold to the corporation, including the proceeds realized from any resale.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attachment -- constitutional law -- conversion -- where security agreement imposed upon debtor obligation to hold specific moneys for creditor and barred debtor from disbursing those moneys for general corporate purposes, and diversion of proceeds occurred, debtor and individual corporate officers who participated in misconduct are liable -- ex parte order of attachment based upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 6201</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (subd 8) is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for failure</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to afford defendants notice and opportunity for hearing prior to seizure of their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff obtained an ex parte order of attachment against the property of the corporate defendant and all the individual defendants.  The complaint contained a cause of action for damages from all of the defendants for the alleged conversion by them of the proceeds of the sale of inventory acquired by the corporate defendant pursuant to a security agreement. Plaintiff's papers sufficiently established the existence of a security interest in the collateral and in the proceeds of any sale thereof, the sale of the collateral, the failure by two of the defendants to pay over the proceeds on behalf of the corporate defendant upon proper demand therefor and the diversion of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Additionally, the express terms of the security agreement created an immediate right to possession of specific moneys, since under its terms the debtor covenanted to account to the plaintiff for the proceeds of any goods upon request.  A prima facie cause of action for conversion was spelled out against two of the defendants, but not against two others.  The security agreement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  imposed upon the debtor the obligation to hold specific moneys for the creditor and barred the debtor from disbursing those moneys for general corporate purposes.  In this context, where a diversion of the proceeds occurs, the debtor and the individual corporate officers who participated in the misconduct are personally liable.  There was ample proof in the pleadings that two of the defendants were corporate officers and knowingly participated in the prohibited conduct.  However, the pleadings are insufficient to establish that either of the other two was an officer of the corporate defendant or anticipated in the conversion of the proceeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An ex parte order of attachment based upon CPLR 6201 (subd 8) is not unconstitutional for failure to afford the defendants notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to the seizure of their property.  The CPLR provisions regarding attachment are closely analogous to the Louisiana statute which was held constitutional in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mitchell v W.T. Grant Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (416 U.S. 600), since: there is judicial scrutiny over the application; the creditor must show that there is a cause of action, that grounds exist and the amount demanded; the creditor is required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to post a bond to protect the debtor from damages; the debtor may regain possession and discharge the attachment by posting a bond; and any person claiming an interest in the debt or property may move for an order to vacate or modify the attachment. Nor is CPLR article 62 defective for failure to provide an immediate postseizure hearing at which the creditor has the burden of proving the grounds upon which the writ issued.  The fact that the burden of proof is placed upon the debtor to establish the order's invalidity is not a ground upon which the entire statutory scheme must fall.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer arrested defendant in a hospital for loitering. After the arrest, the officer noticed a bulge in defendant's pocket which, upon examination, proved to be money. When a gas station attendant identified the money as having been stolen in a robbery by a man wearing clothing similar to defendant's and of similar build who ran in the direction of the hospital, the loitering charge was dismissed and defendant was indicted for robbery. Reversing defendant's conviction, the court determined that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the warrantless search made as an incident to the arrest under the loitering statute, which had been declared unconstitutional prior to defendant's trial, was illegal since the statute plainly undercut the requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution that arrests were lawful only on a showing of probable cause. The court further determined that without the evidence seized in the unlawful search there was no probable cause to support defendant's arrest for robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner bus authority sought review of a judgment by respondent New York Public Employment Relations Board (board), which held that dispatchers and foremen employed by the bus authority did not meet the criteria for management status within the meaning of the Taylor Law, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law, &sect; 201(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board found that the dispatchers and foremen employed by the bus authority did not come within the definition of managerial employees under the Taylor Law, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law, &sect; 201(7)(a), and, accordingly, were not exempt from coverage under the Taylor Law. The bus authority appealed. The court held that the determination of the employees' status under the Taylor Law required a consideration of whether the activities of the dispatchers and foremen had a major role in the administration of agreements or in personnel administration, provided that such roles were not of a routine or clerical nature and required the exercise of independent judgment. The court held that the employees clearly had no power to resolve actual grievances beyond initial claims. The court concluded that the employees did not warrant a designation as managerial because the employees had no role in establishing the standards for terminating employees and could only discharge subordinate employees for conduct which would immediately affect their capacity to perform their duties without danger to the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court confirmed the decision of the board and dismissed the bus authority's petition challenging the board's ruling that the authority's dispatchers and foremen did not meet the definition of managerial employees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- Public Employees' Fair Employment Act -- determination of Public Employment Relations Board that dispatchers and foremen employed by bus authority are not managerial employees, and, therefore, are not excluded from Taylor Law coverage, is confirmed -- they act in supervisory capacity but do not have major nonroutine role in administration of collective bargaining agreements or in personnel administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A determination of the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) that dispatchers and foremen employed by the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority are not managerial employees, and, therefore, are not excluded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from Taylor Law coverage, is confirmed. While these employees act in a supervisory capacity, that fact alone is not sufficient to exclude them from being organized into a bargaining unit, but they must also &quot;have a major role in the administration of [collective bargaining] agreements or in personnel administration provided that such role is not of a routine or clerical nature and requires the exercise of independent judgment&quot; ( Civil Service Law, &sect; 201, subd 7, par [a]).  The record here establishes that, while these employees are involved in the administration of collective bargaining agreements to the extent that they are the ones to whom subordinates would first make their complaints known, they would merely be ascertaining factual matters at that stage, not making any major interpretation of the agreements, and, although they might later be involved as witnesses to factual matters, they clearly have no power to resolve actual grievances once the grievance procedure goes beyond the first step.  The record also establishes that, while they have been given powers which directly affect personnel administration, those powers are exercisable only in accordance with standards which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they have no part in formulating, and, in substance, they are merely a basic level of management, exercising routine roles and having no apparent major role in personnel administration.  Accordingly, the record contains substantial evidence to support the finding of PERB that they do not warrant a designation as managerial employees. </SPAN></P>

At sentencing, it was established that defendant had been convicted of possession of marijuana in Texas for which he had been sentenced to five years in prison, with confinement suspended and probation imposed for five years. Under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06, the trial court sentence defendant as a second felony offender. On appeal, defendant contended &sect; 70.06 was unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that: (1) imposing sentence for a second felony based on another state's felony conviction denied defendant equal protection of the laws guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; (2) such sentencing also resulted in the delegation of legislative authority by the New York Senate and Assembly to legislatures of other jurisdictions in violation of N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The operation of section 70.06 of the Penal Law, which mandates second felony offender status for persons previously convicted in other States for offenses for which a term of imprisonment exceeding one year was authorized, deprives the defendant of the equal protection of the law.  A conviction under various out-of-State statutes would require imposition of second felony offender status, while a conviction in New York State for the same underlying acts would entitle the defendant to first offender status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The term of imprisonment authorized in another jurisdiction cannot serve as the basis for determining the extent of punishment upon a felony conviction in New York State, since a delegation of the responsibility to prescribe punishment would violate the constitutional provision (NY Const, art III, &sect; 1) vesting the legislative power of the State in the Senate and Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant did not waive his right to challenge his sentence by failing to proceed under CPL 400.21 for a determination of his second offender status, since the defendant's prior convictions are not in dispute and have no bearing upon the constitutionality of section 70.06 of the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, section 70.06 of the Penal Law is declared unconstitutional insofar as it provides that the extent of punishment for a New York State felon depends upon the authorized sentence for a conviction in another State, the judgment of conviction should be reversed and the matter remitted for resentencing defendant as a first felony offender. </SPAN></P>

The only connection of the defendant to the statute was the suspicion of a tax investigator based upon observation of 30 cartons of cigarettes and upon hearsay information that a person possibly connected with the premises had previously been arrested for possession of untaxed cigarettes. The quantity of cigarettes observed was too small, the possibility of storage and sale too weak and the privacy interest too great to invoke the inspection powers of the statute, and although it is unclear that the authority to inspect includes the right to enter and search without consent, the statute does not contemplate nonconsensual entry and search of a residence.

Holding subdivision 1 of section 29&nbsp;unconstitutional, the Trial Judge asserted that defendant carrier's lien for the total amount of compensation paid by it was subject to a proportionate share of plaintiff's attorney's fee for prosecuting the third-party action, as computed in relation to the total over-all recovery.  Since subdivision 1 of section 29 does not violate either the State or Federal Constitution, the carrier is reimbursed in full for its lien.  The statute presently gives greater benefits to an injured employee or his dependents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than it did when it was held by both the United States Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals as not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and the Supreme Court's decision has been consistently cited with approval in subsequent decisions of that court.  The explicit language of section 18 of article I of the New York Constitution (which states that &quot;nothing contained in this constitution&quot; shall be construed to limit the plenary power of the Legislature to enact workmen's compensation laws) puts to rest all attacks on the Workmen's Compensation Law predicated on the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a strict application of subdivision 1 of section 29 has been termed unfair and unconscionable, rectification is by its repeal or modification by the Legislature, and while the Legislature has been put on notice of the possible inequity, it has seen fit to do nothing about it.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a young man 16 years of age, was charged with commission of the felonies of robbery in the second degree and assault in the second degree. The trial judge indicated that he would charge defendant as a youthful offender if his probation report would support such a charge. The probation report indicated that defendant had a very serious history. Therefore, the trial judge instead imposed a one year sentence. Defendant appealed the judgment. The judge had absolute discretion in determining whether to charge defendant, a 16-year old boy, as a youthful offender. The purpose of charging defendant was the hope of rehabilitating him. Based on his record, the chance of rehabilitation was not high. Defendant was charged with a felony, not a misdemeanor. Defendant had already received the benefit of being charged as a youthful offender. Based on the defendant's record and the trial judge's discretion, it was appropriate to sentence defendant to one year.</SPAN></P>

Laws 996 against respondent State of New York for reimbursement of funds it had expended in the performance of services under the Mandated Services Act, 1970 N.Y. Laws 138, before the Act was declared unconstitutional. The New York Court of Claims dismissed on the ground that 1972 N.Y. Laws 996 violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. The school appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act provided that qualifying non-public schools were to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in providing various testing, record-keeping, and related services required by separate statutory authority. The payments were not conditioned upon performance, and the amounts of reimbursement were based on the judgment of the New York State Education Department. The Act was declared an unconstitutional aid to religion, as the aid devoted to secular functions was not identifiable and separate from aid to sectarian activities. The State was permanently enjoined from reimbursing non-public schools under the Act. Prior to the Act being declared unconstitutional, the school incurred expenses for which it would have been entitled to reimbursement. 1972 N.Y. Laws 996 conferred jurisdiction to hear, audit, and determine claims of eligible non-public schools for reimbursement of funds expended in reliance of the Act. The court held that 1972 N.Y. Laws 996 violated the Establishment Clause, as payments thereunder were to be determined by the same formula as had been in effect under the Act. The constitutional interests were recurring, as the State needed to provide oversight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 996 of the Laws of 1972, which confers on the Court of Claims jurisdiction to determine claims by nonpublic secondary and elementary schools for reimbursement for expenses incurred in providing statutorily required services no longer reimbursable under the invalidated Mandated Services Act (L. 1970, ch. 138), is unconstitutional.  The Mandated Services Act was held to violate the religion clause of First Amendment because no relationship&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was shown between the payment formula and the secular purposes to which the payments would be applied.  If payments are to be made under chapter 996 of the Laws of 1972 according to that same formula, such payments would be unconstitutional because not limited to an identifiable secular purpose.  If only actual costs are reimbursed, some process of audit, inspection and supervision would be required which would foster an excessive entanglement between church schools and State.  Although payments have been upheld where the constitutional interests involved were &quot;implicated only once under special circumstances that will not recur&quot;, that situation occurred when the &quot;entangling&quot; process was already completed with no invalidity of the payments per se, whereas in this case the payments themselves have been invalidated and State supervision would be required.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant also challenged the entire jury panel under the Sixth Amendment, claiming that students, blacks, women, the poor and young people had been intentionally excluded, depriving her of the right to a fair and impartial jury. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, finding first that N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was improperly convicted of both grand larceny in the second degree (Penal Law, &sect; 155.35) and a violation of section 145 of the Social Services Law. The evidence unquestionably demonstrated that she committed a series of acts with the culpable intent or design of appropriating public welfare funds to herself or to third parties, and the same conduct on her part constituted violations of both section 155.35 of the Penal Law and section 145 of the Social Services Law. The latter section provides that a person who violates that statute is guilty of a misdemeanor unless his act constitutes a violation of the Penal Law, in which case he is to be punished in accordance with the penalties fixed by the Penal Law. Therefore, and in view of the fact that the record supports the larceny conviction, no misdemeanor offense survived of which defendant could be convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The trial court erred in failing to conduct a hearing on a challenge made by defendant to the jury panel. Although it was not made in writing, as provided in CPL 270.10, it was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made in open court and before the selection of the jury, and the record contains fully and with specificity the grounds therefor and the arguments made in respect of it.  Absent a showing of prejudice to the People, the lack of a writing in and of itself should not preclude review of the issue on the merits.  Nor was the failure of defendant to specifically request a factual hearing fatal, since CPL 270.10 provides for a trial of the issues of fact and law arising out of a challenge to the jury panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The trial court abused its discretion when it denied a request by defendant for a pretrial discovery of inter-office memoranda of the Department of Social Services.  If a welfare recipient who is a defendant in a criminal case desires to waive the protection of confidentiality, she is entitled to discovery of such inter-office memoranda as are relevant to an issue in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Circumstantial evidence adduced by the People was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with the requisite felonious intent, and the trial court's charge was eminently fair and correctly stated the law.  Its errors in failing to conduct the hearing on the challenge to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury panel and in not permitting the requested discovery make a new trial necessary, at which trial the court should note the merger of the charged violation of section 145 of the Social Services Law into the larceny charge.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner owner appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which directed respondent village to correct deficiencies in its sewage system and directed respondent State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation (commissioner) to issue a permit to the owner allowing him to connect to the sewage system upon proof of the village's corrections.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner planned to construct apartment buildings on his real property. The owner alleged that his property was taken without just compensation by reason of denial of his request to develop it. On remand from a previous appeal, the trial court ordered the village to correct sewage system deficiencies.

The village had submitted to a consent decree of a state agency concerning the system; the village later submitted to a modified decree, which extended the village's time to make corrections. On appeal, the court affirmed as modified the judgment of the trial court, which directed the village to make corrections and directed the commissioner to issue a permit to the owner allowing him to connect to the system upon proof of the corrections. The court reinstated the owner's cause of action for money damages and an immediate trial was allowed.  N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 relief was, to all intents and purposes, ineffectual and unavailing to the owner because, although the village had been under a consent order for nearly nine years, it had no definite timetable for making the corrections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner should be permitted to adjudicate immediately his claim for money damages for a taking of his property without just compensation resulting from nonapproval&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of sewer connections to his apartment buildings.  Prior article 78 relief, directing the respondent village to correct deficiencies in its sewage system and directing the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation to issue a permit upon proof of such corrections, has been ineffectual. Although the village has been under a consent order for nearly nine years to modify its sewage system, it has not done so and its timetable is indefinite. A property owner who has been denied an existing governmental service proves a constitutional taking when he proves that the denial is confiscatory in effect, unreasonable in terms of necessity and indefinite in duration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Court of Claims does not have exclusive jurisdiction over petitioner's claim against the commissioner, and the claim may be adjudicated in Supreme Court, which has jurisdiction over Fifth Amendment claims against municipal corporations and other public entities. Where a municipal corporation is the &quot;final actor&quot; in a multi-governmental regulation which amounts to an unconstitutional appropriation of private property, the Supreme Court is the appropriate forum for resolution of the claim against the various governmental entities.  </SPAN></P>

However, the court found that the act in question did not violate N.Y. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two men held up a bar. Three patrons at the bar gave the police descriptions of defendant. The police showed them photographs of men matching their descriptions. Each patron picked defendant as one of the perpetrators of the robbery. At a pretrial hearing to determine whether the photographic procedures utilized were suggestive, the people offered into evidence the photographs that were shown to the victims. Defendant's request that the people be required to produce the patrons themselves was denied. He was convicted of robbery. The court affirmed and held that there was no error committed when the trial court refused to require the people to produce the patrons at the pretrial hearing. The people properly met their initial burden of going forward with evidence by showing the reasonableness of the police conduct in the first instance. The patrons who failed to testify at the hearing testified at the trial, and no testimony was elicited from them that showed that any improper identification procedure in violation of due process was used.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- identification of defendant -- burden of proof -- burden of proof is upon defendant to show that pretrial identification procedure violated due process -- since burden of proof is upon defendant to show improper identification, People met burden of going forward with evidence by showing reasonableness of police conduct in first instance, and there was no need to produce identifying eyewitnesses at suppression hearing -- upon testimony that defendant had pierced ear and upon showing at trial that his ear was not pierced, People could rebut such evidence with police testimony that defendant's ear had string in it two days after crime -- sentence to concurrent 15-year terms is not unduly harsh upon conviction of three counts of robbery committed with gun and involving assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The burden of proof is upon the defendant to show that a pretrial identification procedure violated his right to due process.  The burden of establishing a waiver&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a constitutional right is upon the prosecution, but the burden of showing that an illegal procedure violated the right to due process is upon the defendant.  The statutory language ( CPL 710.20) with respect to identification testimony provides that suppression may be ordered upon a &quot;claim&quot; of impropriety by the defendant, and such terminology indicates that the burden of proving such a claim should be upon the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the burden of showing an improper identification is upon the defendant, the People met their initial burden of going forward with evidence by showing the reasonableness of police conduct in the first instance, and there was no need to produce the identifying eyewitnesses at the pretrial hearing. To require such production would be impractical and unfair and would further inconvenience the witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Upon eyewitness testimony that the defendant had had a pierced ear and upon a showing at the trial that the defendant's ear was not pierced, the People had the right to rebut such evidence by eliciting testimony from a police officer that the defendant's ear had a string in it two days after the crime.  Even if that rebuttal were in error, it would be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nonconstitutional error which would not be reversible without a showing that there was a significant probability of acquittal absent the error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The sentence to concurrent terms of 15 years upon conviction of three counts of robbery in the first degree is not unduly harsh, since a gun was used in the commission of the crime and one of the victims was assaulted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, who were mother and a daughter, sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), which convicted them of assault in the first degree and imposed a sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of assault in the first degree. The court affirmed the convictions, but reduced their sentences. The court found that although the notice-of-alibi statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20, was probably unconstitutional prior to its modification in 1974 because of its failure to provide reciprocal rights to the accused, the cases holding the statute unconstitutional were not entitled to retroactive application. Thus, because the trial started before 1974 and defendants both testified that at the time of the commission of the crime the daughter was visiting a friend, the trial court's refusal to permit testimony by the alibi witness because of defendants' failure to give the required notice, did not infect the verdict. Further, the court found that the complainant and two witnesses who had observed the incident from a short distance testified to the daughter's presence at and participation in the assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff distributor and defendant dealer cross-appealed from an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, New York County (New York), which denied a motion by the distributor to enjoin the dealer pendente lite from offering for sale or selling fair traded products below their fair trade prices, and denied a cross motion by the dealer for summary judgment dismissing the distributor's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The distributor was the exclusive distributor of a line of products and entered into a fair trade agreement with the dealer. The distributor had previously won a permanent injunction against the dealer for certain sales. Several years later the dealer ran an ad in two newspapers whereby it offered the products at discounted prices. The court affirmed the refusal to enter an injunction against the dealer and granted the dealer's motion for summary judgment because the state's Fair Trade Law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law art. 24-A, &sect; 369-a et seq., did not prohibit the activities complained of. The court found that the McGuire Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45, left the acceptance or rejection of fair trade legislation to the individual states, but where adopted it did not have such extraterritorial effect as to prohibit sales in states which had no such legislation. The court held that to apply the prohibition to newspaper advertising and a sale resulting therefrom would not only have unduly hampered and restricted the right of free publication, but would have permitted one state to dominate or interfere improperly in the economic activities of another.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a District of Columbia corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of a New Jersey corporation, was a franchised dealer of high fidelity equipment distributed by plaintiff and had entered into a fair trade agreement with plaintiff.  In newspaper advertisements in New York and Philadelphia, defendant offered for sale plaintiff's products at discount prices, the advertisements suggesting ordering by mail and stating that the sale was made and title was to pass in Washington, D. C., a non-fair trade jurisdiction.  In an action to enjoin defendant from advertising, offering for sale or selling plaintiff's products below the fair trade prices (see General Business Law, &sect; 369-a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), the cross motion by defendant for summary judgment dismissing the complaint is granted. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the United States Congress in adopting the McGuire Act (U.

To apply the prohibition to newspaper advertising and sales resulting therefrom would not only unduly hamper and restrict the right of free publication, but would permit one State to interfere in the economic activities of another.  The State statute derives its authority from the Federal statute and in any conflict the Federal statute prevails.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the issues were whether N.Y.

The court found that &sect; 400.21(3) was constitutional, and there was no authority for defendants' contentions that they had a constitutional right to stand silent on the issues of the truth or constitutional validity of a record of previous convictions. The court also found that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 was constitutional because the legislature's exercise of discretion in determining punishment was not unusually severe, a legislative enactment carried a strong presumption of constitutionality, and the fact that the sentencing statute was mandatory eliminated the possibility that it was inflicted arbitrarily. As to an alleged noncompliance with N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.21, the court determined that defendants were informed in either the plea hearing or the sentencing hearing, or both, that they were second felony offenders and as such would be subject to the minimum sentences prescribed by N.Y.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- second felony offenders -- in adopting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 400.21</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (subd. 3), Legislature clearly intended to eliminate right, previously accorded to defendant convicted of felony and charged with being second felony offender, to stand silent on issue of prior convictions and not have his silence construed as admission -- nor is right to remain silent on issue of truth or constitutional validity of prior convictions right which is protected by constitutional guarantee of due process -- provisions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 70.06 of Penal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for mandatory minimum terms for second felony offenders do not violate constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment -- defendants who were not served with statements setting forth alleged predicate felonies, as required by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 400.21</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> or were not advised of their rights under that section, but who voluntarily admitted that they were persons named in prior felony conviction records, in face of advice by court as to mandatory minimum terms, waived their privileges against self incrimination and their rights under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and also estopped themselves from attacking validity of sentences imposed -- furthermore, there was substantial compliance with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- but attention should be given to every detail of it before defendant is sentenced as second felony offender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPL 400.21, which governs the procedure for determining whether a defendant is a second felony offender, provides, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that a defendant who stands convicted of a felony, and who might be a second felony offender, must be given a copy of a statement setting forth the alleged predicate felony, and must be asked by the court whether he wishes to controvert any allegation made therein; that, if he does, he must specify the particular allegation or allegations which he wishes to controvert, and that he shall be deemed to have admitted uncontroverted allegations in the statement.  In adopting this statute, the Legislature clearly intended to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  eliminate the right, accorded to such a defendant under predecessor statutes, to stand silent on the issue of prior convictions and not have his silence construed as an admission.  Nor is the right to stand silent on the issue of the truth or constitutional validity of prior convictions a right which is protected by the constitutional guarantee of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The provisions of section 70.06 of the Penal Law which prescribed mandatory minimum terms for second felony offenders do not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Defendants who were not served with copies of the statement required by CPL 400.21, or were not advised of their rights under that section to controvert specific allegations and to a hearing in the event of such controversion, or of the fact that uncontroverted allegations would be taken as true, but who, in open court and with counsel present, elected to admit voluntarily that they were the persons named in prior felony conviction records called to their attention by the court, and did so in the face of advice by the court that it would be mandated to impose specified minimum terms upon them as second felony offenders, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereby waived their privileges against self incrimination and their rights under CPL 400.21, and also estopped themselves from attacking the validity of the sentences imposed upon them in accordance with the mandate of section 70.06 of the Penal Law. Furthermore, there was substantial compliance with CPL 400.21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Since CPL 400.21 is mandatory on its face and is easily complied with, attention should be given to its every detail before a defendant is sentenced as a second felony offender. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">School board officials refused a parochial school's request to furnish transportation for field trips to be conducted by the school. A resident filed a petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to compel the officials to provide transportation to and from school related activities for pupils enrolled at the parochial school. The petition alleged that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3635 required a school district to furnish transportation to all students residing within its boundaries and that to deny equal transportation to nonpublic school children unconstitutionally denied them equal protection of the law. The school board filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the resident had failed to obtain administrative review before seeking judicial intervention. The trial court granted the petition and directed the school board to provide filed trip transportation to nonpublic students. The school board appealed. On appeal, the court reversed, dismissed the resident's petition, and held that no statutory authority existed to permit the school board to transport nonpublic school students on field trips and that there was right to equal aid in the absence of specific legislative authorization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- transportation of students on field trips -- public school district is not required to provide transportation to nonpublic school students for field trips, since there is no authority for such transportation corresponding to implicit authority to provide such for public school students -- requirement that transportation is to be provided for all students in district is worded entirely in terms of transportation &quot;to and from&quot; schools -- provisions empowering school districts to purchase or contract for vehicles for transportation of children contain no specific authority for assistance to nonpublic schools -- failure to provide field trip transportation for nonpublic school students does not violate right of equal protection of law, since all students have equal right to attend public schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1. The respondent public school district is not required to provide bus transportation to nonpublic schools for use in connection with field trips conducted by the nonpublic schools as part of their educational curriculum. A public school district has only the statutory powers delegated to it by the Legislature.  Under the wide range of powers implicit in subdivisions 3, 5 and 33 of section 1709 of the Education Law, pursuant to which a school district has all powers reasonably necessary to prescribe a course of study and make provision for the instruction of pupils, a school district may conduct educational field trips as an alternative to classroom instruction.  No corresponding authority is conferred to provide such trips for nonpublic schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 1 of section 3635 of the Education Law, which requires school districts to provide transportation for all children within the school district, is worded entirely in terms of providing transportation &quot;to and from&quot; schools and makes no reference to field trips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In those instances in which assistance is extended to nonpublic schools there has always been specific statutory authority, and no such express provision is found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in subdivisions 25 and 27 of section 1709 of the Education Law, which empowers a school district to purchase or contract for vehicles for transportation of children of the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure of the school district to make field trips available to nonpublic school students does not violate their right to equal protection of the law under the United States and New York State Constitutions, since all children have an equal opportunity to attend public schools. The fact that such opportunity is foregone deprives the child of nothing by State action, and while there is a right to attend a nonpublic school, there is no corresponding right to receive aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, the judgment of Special Term should be reversed and the petition dismissed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation argued that it was exempt from the assessment of sales and use tax by reason of N.Y.

On appeal, the court held that the Commission's determination assessing the tax against the corporation should have been annulled because the corporation was entitled to the exemption. Specifically, the court noted that the corporation was a marine contractor primarily engaged in dredging operations. Thus, the court held that the corporation's business was the improving of the arteries of interstate travel, and that the activities had to be construed as &quot;interstate commerce&quot; within the contemplation of &sect; 1115(8)(a). In addition, the court noted that there was abundant proof that the corporation's vessels were continually moved, both before and during the tax period in question, from state to state and did not come to rest for use or consumption in the local business of New York.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff purchased 13 farms located in mountainous regions mainly in Delaware County.  During an eight-year period, he sold off portions of the farms by making random sales of 263 parcels of land to purchasers who were seasonal residents who used the land mainly for recreational purposes.  The structures that were erected by the purchasers were only put to seasonal recreational use.  The State Department of Health commenced proceedings against plaintiff for alleged violations of section 1116 of the Public Health Law, which provides that no subdivision or portion thereof shall be sold until a map or plan of such subdivision is filed and approved by the appropriate department of health. The intent of the statute is to assure proper water and sewage facilities in subdivision developments.  Such sales from mountainous farmlands of no uniform size or shape do not constitute subdivision development and, since the land was not divided for sale as residential lots or residential building plots, the sales do not come within the purview of sections 1115 and 1116.  To require plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to submit detailed plans for water and sewage facilities for the vast amount of land involved where he was selling off acreage at random for recreational purposes would be contrary to the intent of the statute.

Then section 240.36 of the Penal Law prohibiting loitering in any place by two or more persons for the purpose of using or possessing a dangerous drug cannot be construed so as to make loitering in a private apartment an offense.  The rationale of loitering statutes is the prevention of minor offenses or incipient crimes in places frequented by the public for the protection of the public.  When applied to an apartment, the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not insulate the public from injury or assist the police in maintaining the peace.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appeals in proceedings of the Monroe County Court (New York), were consolidated.

I, &sect; 5, as cruel and unusual punishment. The People appealed, N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The second defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance, second degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.18; criminal use of drug paraphernalia; and criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument. The court explained that the public interest usually required that legislative enactments were given recognition and enforced by the courts as embodying the people's will. Although the punishment was not so severe as to be degrading, nor arbitrarily inflicted, unacceptable to contemporary society, disproportionate to the crime, or failing to serve a penal purpose more effectively than a less severe punishment, the court found some aspects troubling. The court noted that addicts and non-addicts were treated the same even though the purposes for their crimes differed. The court concluded that the punishment could have been justified by the heinous nature of the crime. The court also noted that lifetime parole subjected defendants to perpetual limitation of liberty.</SPAN></P>

The fact that sale of heroin is a heinous, essentially violent crime justifies similar treatment for addict and nonaddict alike, and because of the high recidivist rate among felons convicted of narcotics crimes, the Legislature did not act without reasonable justification in providing for lifetime supervision for released offenders as a protection for the public.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two cases were combined to determine the same issue. In both cases, defendants, the nonresident automobile owners and operators, appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Erie County (New York), denying defendants' motions to vacate an order of attachment of an insurance policy for the benefit of plaintiff residents, who had incurred injury and loss as a result of automobile accidents involving defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two cases were combined to determine whether courts in the State of New York were required to give full effect to a provision in a casualty insurance policy issued in another state. The provision stated that the insurer had no obligation under the policies in a state where the presence of an insurer-obligor provided the sole basis of jurisdiction over the insured. In both cases, the parties were from multiple states and were involved in car accidents. Companies located outside of New York, but authorized to do business in the state, provided the policies. Plaintiffs obtained orders to attach defendants' insurance policies. The lower court denied defendants' motions to vacate the orders. The appeals court affirmed the denials in each case. A New York resident was able to acquire in rem jurisdiction of an insured defendant by attaching an insurance policy protecting the defendant. In view of New York's strong public policy for the protection of its residents, the doctrine of forum non conveniens was only to be applied upon a formidable showing by defendant of inconvenience and hardship in the trial of the case in New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court's judgments were affirmed. Defendants in both cases bore the burden of establishing that it would be an inconvenience and a hardship to attend the trial of the case in New York. Defendants were unable to meet this burden in either case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attachment -- attachment of insurance policy of nonresident -- disclaimer provision -- doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Seider v. Roth (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">17 N Y 2d 111)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is applicable to obtain quasi-in-rem jurisdiction over nonresident defendants by attachment of defendants' automobile liability insurance policies which were issued in another State, despite provision in policies that insurer shall have no obligation thereunder in State where presence of insurer-obligor provides sole basis of jurisdiction over insured, since such provision contravenes public policy of New York -- forum non conveniens not applicable; defendants have not made formidable showing of inconvenience and hardship in</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> trial of case in New York -- orders denying motions to vacate attachments and dismiss complaints affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs are New York residents who were injured by nonresident defendants in automobile accidents occurring outside the State.  Defendants' automobile liability insurance policies, while not issued in this State, were issued by an insurer doing business in New York.  Plaintiffs thereupon instituted an action by service on the insurer in New York of an order for the attachment of the insurance policies for purposes of acquiring quasi-in-rem jurisdiction over defendants pursuant to the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Seider </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Roth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (17 N Y 2d 111). Although a disclaimer provision contained in each policy which provided that the insurer &quot;shall have no obligation to indemnify, pay to or on behalf of, or defend any person entitled to protection under this policy where such obligations or this policy provide the sole basis of jurisdiction of the court over said persons&quot;, is valid where made, it is not recognized as valid in New York since it contravenes the public policy of this State.  Such provision does not defeat the acquiring of in rem jurisdiction over the insured defendants by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  way of a valid attachment of their insurance policies in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that the form of the policies including the disclaimer provision was approved by the Superintendent of Insurance does not mean that the provision should be honored by New York courts since the Superintendent cannot vitiate or remake the public policies of this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In actions founded upon the application of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Seider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle, the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">forum non conveniens</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should only be applied upon a formidable showing by defendant of inconvenience and hardship in the trial of the case in New York, which was not shown here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, the orders denying the motions to vacate attachments and dismiss the complaints are affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Oneida County Court (New York), which convicted him, upon his guilty plea, of burglary in the third degree. Defendant was sentenced pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 as a second felony offender to an indeterminate term with a minimum of two and a maximum of four years. Defendant attacked the constitutionality of the second felony offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by treating felons with prior felony convictions as a class different from first-time felons. Where the challenge was to a legislative classification the question became whether there was a rational relationship between the classification employed in the statute and some legitimate state purpose, and where fundamental liberties were affected by the legislation, a &quot;compelling&quot; state interest had to be demonstrated. The question to be determined, insofar as the second felony offender statute was concerned, was whether the increased punishment of second felony offenders bore a reasonable relationship to some compelling state interest. The court concluded that it did. The court held that it was a reasonable exercise of legislative prerogative in providing for the public safety to limit judicial discretion upon defendant's conviction as a second felony offender and that such limitation did not deprive defendant of his right to substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant for burglary and sentenced him as a second felony offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- second felony offenders -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 70.06 of Penal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, providing for mandatory imprisonment of defendant convicted of second felony within 10 years of prior felony conviction, is constitutional; compelling State interest in public safety is promoted -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is not denial of equal protection of law since all second felony offenders are treated same -- although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> limits plea bargaining, such bargaining is not constitutional right -- limitation on judicial discretion in sentencing does not deprive second felony offender of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 70.06 of the Penal Law, providing for mandatory imprisonment of a defendant convicted of a second felony within a 10-year period following a prior felony conviction with sentence imposed to be an intermediate one varying according to the seriousness of the second felony, is constitutional.  Even if it is assumed that mandatory and increased incarceration does not further the policy expressed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Penal Law of rehabilitation, a compelling State interest in public safety is promoted because of the deterrent effect of incarceration and because it removes from society an individual who has previously been guilty of a felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute is not a denial of equal protection of the law since all second felony offenders are treated the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that a defendant's fate, as to the pleading process, is fixed at the time of indictment does not render the statute unconstitutional although a defendant is not permitted to plead to a misdemeanor in satisfaction of the indictment thereby limiting plea bargaining. In any event, plea bargaining is not a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is a reasonable exercise of the legislative prerogative in providing for the public safety to limit judicial discretion with respect to fashioning sentences for second felony offenders. Such limitation does not deprive those offenders of the right to substantive due process.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee voluntarily left her job with the employer after four weeks and accepted employment elsewhere, where she worked for 11 weeks. Her second employment was terminated and she commenced receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Pursuant to &sect; 581(1)(e), the first 11 weeks of her unemployment were charged to her second job and the next four weeks were charged to the employer. The employer unsuccessfully challenged the charges as assessed against its experience rating account, and sought review. The court affirmed the judgment, noting that the constitutionality of legislation assessing the cost of unemployment benefits to employers without regard to the employers' fault regarding the particular instance of employment had been repeatedly sustained. The court reasoned that while there were inequities in the scheme, it bore a rational relationship to the elimination of the problem of unemployment, and the court could not properly second-guess the wisdom of the legislature in distributing the cost of unemployment insurance benefits unless the means chosen were arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 581 (subd. 1, par.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted, upon his plea of guilty, of a class D felony of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the sixth degree, for which he could have been sentenced to a maximum term of seven years.

On appeal, the court modified the trial court judgment by changing the sentence to a five-year period of probation and by certification of defendant to the care and custody of the Drug Abuse Control Commission of the State of New York. The court chose to give defendant an opportunity to be treated at a drug center, rather than continue to be incarcerated in a maximum security prison. The court noted that, although one of the penalties for criminal action was punishment of the individual, the principal aim of the law was to rehabilitate offenders and to return them to society as useful law-abiding members.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The classification of possession of a sufficient quantity of marijuana as a Class D felony, carrying a maximum penalty of seven years, does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While escorting a prisoner, the patrolman wrongfully assaulted the prisoner. The patrolman was immediately suspended and then arrested in connection with the criminal charges that arose from the incident. The patrolman was acquitted of the criminal charges.

The patrolman challenged the commissioner's determination, and also contended that he was entitled to full pay for the period of his suspension pending that determination. The court modified the commissioner's determination only as to the patrolman's pay for the period of his suspension. The court held that the patrolman's acquittal of the criminal charges did not mandate the dismissal of the department's charge. The court determined that the patrolman was entitled to pay for the period of his suspension that was an unreasonable time for the filing of the departmental charges and the determination of the same.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On August 30, 1968, petitioner, a police officer, was arrested for assaulting a prisoner he was escorting on that date.  On the same date, petitioner was suspended from the department and arrested on criminal charges arising from the assault. The departmental charge and specification was filed September 6, 1968.  On January 22, 1969 petitioner was acquitted of the criminal charges after trial in the Criminal Court.  On October 6, 1969, after a departmental hearing, respondent police commissioner, in his determination found petitioner guilty of assaulting a prisoner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in violation of certain rules and procedures of the New York City Police Department and directed that petitioner lose 14 days' vacation and be on probation for one year.  Since the determination under review is supported by substantial evidence, petitioner's assertion that dismissal of the departmental charge is mandated by his acquittal of criminal charges, and that the rules and procedures which he violated are unconstitutional, is without merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 434a-20.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York does not bar payment to a suspended police force member for the period of his suspension simply because of the fact of conviction on the departmental charge.  Charges must be filed within a reasonable time after suspension and trial must thereafter be held.  While the first 30 days of a suspension of a member of the police force is, as a matter of law, a reasonable time in which to file departmental charges and determine the charges after a hearing ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Stein </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Murphy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 44 A D 2d 796), this does not prohibit a factual finding that a period in excess of 30 days may also be reasonable with regard to the totality of circumstances.  Accordingly, the determination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of respondent police commissioner is modified, on the law, to the extent of remanding to Special Term the factual issues as to what extent the delay beyond 30 days in reaching a determination on the departmental charge was reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Albany County Court (New York), entered upon a verdict convicting him of the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a minimum of seven years and a maximum of life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, and he was sentenced him to an indeterminate term of imprisonment with a minimum of seven years and a maximum of life. The court affirmed this decision. The court held that no reversible error occurred when the trial judge instructed the jury to go to dinner after the judge received a note stating that the jury was unable to agree following approximately two hours of deliberations. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the sentence imposed was unconstitutional as being cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Federal and New York State Constitutions. In so holding, the court considered (1) the nature and gravity of the offense, (2) the legislative purpose behind the punishment, (3) how other jurisdictions would have punished defendant for the same offense, and (4) how the punishment compared to other punishments in the same jurisdiction for other types of crimes. After considering these factors, the court concluded that defendant failed to establish that the mandatory imposition of lifetime surveillance was without a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- drug law -- mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment for criminal sale of narcotic substance in third degree is not cruel and unusual punishment, since it is not disproportionate to crime -- there is no prejudice to defendant in undisclosed note from jury to Judge, and any error was waived by failure to object.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under subdivision 2 of section 70.00 of the Penal Law for criminal sale of a narcotic substance in the third degree is not at the present time cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions.  Under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, punishment should not be disproportionate to the offense, as determined by the nature and gravity of the offense, the legislative purpose for punishment, a comparison&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with other jurisdictions, and a comparison with punishment for other crimes.  The criminal activity resulting from the drug market requires a strong deterrent, and severe punishment of importers alone would not be a practical deterrent. Some other States have similar or more severe sentences, and the insidious effect of the transfer of hard drugs is a sound basis for punishment equal to or, by the partial elimination of plea bargaining, exceeding that for &quot;assassins, homicidal incendiaries and kidnappers&quot;, since hard drugs are a prior contributing factor of their crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There was no prejudice to the defendant with respect to an undisclosed note from the jury to the Judge, informing him that it was unable to agree upon a verdict.  Any error was waived by failure to object and would not, in any event, justify reversal.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 7801, seeking an order of prohibition to prevent the trial judge and the state from proceeding against him on a homicide indictment. There had been a judicial finding in a different case that the county selection of a grand jury pool violated constitutional due process requirements because it routinely excluded students and deliberately discriminated against women.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of the denial of his application, defendant claimed that he was entitled to a dismissal of the indictment returned by the illegally constituted grand jury because it was constitutionally infirm and that his allegations of constitutional deprivations precluded the dismissal of his application for failing to comply with the requirement under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.35 that he file a motion to dismiss the indictment within 30 days of a plea of not guilty. Finding that, notwithstanding the civil nature of a N.Y.

In so doing, the court held that defendant's unwarranted failure to comply with &sect; 210.35 and his failure to demonstrate any prejudice that required relief in the interests of justice, rendered his application meritless and constituted a waiver of his right to object to the grand jury's composition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court examined Oneida County Charter (Local Laws, 1961, No. 3 of County of Oneida), art. XVI, XVII, and XVIII.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents filed two actions that were consolidated for the trial against the contractor. One was for the wrongful death of one of the infants and the other was for the personal injuries sustained by the other two infants. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the parents and awarded them damages. The trial court granted the contractor's motion to set aside the jury's award of damages as excessive. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 did not make the provisions of N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-4.2, which limited damages to pecuniary injuries resulting from the decedent's death to the persons for whose benefits the action was brought, unconstitutional. The court found no ground to overturn the trial court's action in finding the verdict was excessive. Further, there was no statutory limitation of damages in a case for pecuniary loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Each of the inmates had been denied parole release without a statement of reasons by appellants. The inmates filed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus to compel appellants to provide such statements. The trial court ordered that the proceeding be treated as a class action and ruled that appellants had to provide each member of the class with a written statement setting forth the ground for the parole denial. Appellants sought review, contending that the trial court erred in certifying the class and in compelling appellants to furnish a written statement. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the inmates possessed no presently existing interest in liberty or property that was threatened by further governmental deprivation that would justifiably support a claim for due process. The court further held that a written statement of reasons was unnecessary because judicial review in parole denial cases was severely limited in scope. The court concluded that the trial court also erred in designating the proceeding as a class action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act authorized the Commissioner to sell a certain state-owned parcel of land to the purchaser upon such terms and conditions as the Commissioner determined. The purchaser acquired the land from the Commissioner pursuant to the Act and used it as a recharge basin for water drainage. The MTA later acquired a nearby parcel for use as a transportation center, and surface water from its parcel drained into the basin. The corporation brought an action against defendants for a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motions to dismiss brought by the MTA and the Commissioner, as well as the summary judgment motion brought by the purchaser, and defendants appealed. The court, which treated all the motions as being for summary judgment, held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the corporation failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the Act violated any statutory or constitutional provisions. The purchaser had agreed to pay consideration, to continue using the property as a basin, to grant the MTA an easement for its drainage, and to maintain the property at no cost to the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The counselor was accused of sleeping with a student and he was suspended without pay under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3020-a. The counselor brought an action against the school board and alleged that the suspension without pay pending the outcome of his disciplinary hearing was unconstitutional. The court held that there was no basis for the lower court's decision to bar disciplinary proceedings on the charge that the counselor slept with a student because the issue went to the heart of his ability to perform his duty without destroying the public trust. The court held that &sect; 3020-a was not unconstitutional. Although the statute was deficient because it did not limit the length of the suspension, the court saved the statute when it imposed a 30-day limit, as provided in the statutes for the suspension for civil servants. The court held that the counselor was entitled to pay after the 30 days expired even though the disciplinary process was not completed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant state tax commission appealed an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which denied its motion to dismiss plaintiff stock exchanges' complaint for a declaration that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 270-a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stock exchanges, located in outside New York, sought a declaration that &sect; 270-a amending the existing stock transfer tax law was constitutionally invalid. The tax commission sought to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction; that the stock exchanges had no legal capacity to sue because they were not subject to the transfer tax and were not legally aggrieved thereby; and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The trial court denied the motion and the tax commission appealed. The court modified the judgment to the extent of declaring that the provisions of 1968 N.Y. Laws 827 were constitutional, holding that New York courts had jurisdiction to decide the case and that the stock exchanges had standing to maintain the action because the purpose of the amendment was to discourage diversion of stock transactions from New York exchanges. Therefore, the stock exchanges could have been potentially injured by the amendment. However, there was no constitutional infirmity in N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 270-a because the State's taxing power could be used to promote the economy of the taxing unit by favoring nonresidents over residents.</SPAN></P>

The underlying motivation of the Legislature was not to favor New York stock exchanges over out-of-State exchanges, but to enact legislation providing taxation sufficient to permit the State and its subdivisions to raise funds to meet the increasing needs of governmental services.  The taxing power may be used to promote the economy of the taxing unit by favoring nonresidents over residents. Further, the ease of collection warrants the distinction for transactions in New York are less susceptible to tax evasion than those made outside the State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs have standing to maintain the action since the purpose of section 270-a was to discourage diversion of stock transactions from New York exchanges and plaintiffs may, therefore, claim to be potentially injured by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1971 N.Y. Laws 387 transferred supervision over the employees from the administrative board of the judicial conference to the county supervisors. The trial court held that the county thus had the right to require a competitive examination and to terminate employees who did not make the eligible list. On appeal, the court reversed because N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28 vested the judicial conference with the administrative supervision of the unified court system, and the various departments subject to the direction and control of the courts were part of that system. The inclusion of the probation department in the court system accorded with reason, common sense, and the integrity of the judiciary because probation departments were limited in their function to providing of ancillary services to the courts, and the confidential relationship between the courts and the department required close control by the courts. While the board could be made subject to reasonable limitations in the exercise of its supervisory power, 1971 N.Y. Laws 387 divested the board of such power, which violated N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28 and which the legislature thus was powerless to do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 387 of the Laws of 1971, effective September 1, 1971, in effect transferred supervision over various county probation departments from the Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference to the boards of supervisors or county legislatures of the counties.  The unified court system was created&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the adoption of article VI of the State Constitution, effective on September 1, 1962.  Administrative authority over ancillary services was placed in the courts by virtue of the extensive court reorganization in 1962 and, accordingly, on September 1, 1962 the Nassau County Probation Department became a part of the unified court system as an auxiliary service.  Insofar as chapter 387 of the Laws of 1971 places supervision and control of the Nassau County Probation Department in the county rather than in the judiciary, it is violative of section 28 of article VI of the State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

The teacher filed an action for a judgment of restraint, and the school board's determination was annulled because the teacher was dismissed for acts of incompetence not charged, depriving her of her rights to a fair hearing and due process. After the teacher was restored to her position as a tenured teacher, the school board proceeded de novo against the teacher. The teacher was then served with a notice of the school board's proceedings and a copy of the statement of charges against her. The notice properly informed the teacher that she had 10 days within which to request a formal hearing on the charges. Instead, the teacher again filed an action for a judgment of restraint, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the school board adequately complied with the requirements of a fair hearing and due process. In reinstituting the proceedings against the teacher, all the school board did was to add more details and specifications to the charge of incompetence so as to allow the teacher to adequately prepare for a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>

The hearing officer determined that the landowners had divided a tract of land with five or more parcels along an existing road for sale as residential lots. The landowners claimed that the determination was not supported by substantial evidence. The court agreed, holding that: (1) the Department of Health proceeded on the basis that the landowners' land consisted of a single tract, although their deed contained three descriptions; (2) by ordinary definition, custom, and usage, the three descriptions would be considered three separate tracts and there was no evidence that the 26 conveyances were out of one of the tracts or out of all the tracts; and (3) where the sales were of recreation lands, there was nothing in the record that indicated that the land was conveyed for residential purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After charges against them for allegedly violating 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1952 were dismissed in federal court for insufficient evidence, petitioner defendants and intervenor defendant were charged in a state indictment with violating N.Y.

Claiming the state prosecutions violated their rights against double jeopardy, U.S. Const. amend. V and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, petitioners applied for writs of prohibition, with intervenor being allowed to intervene, to restrain respondent prosecutors and judges from pursuing the state prosecution. In denying the petitions, the court ruled that, while the same facts were involved in each, double jeopardy provisions did not bar the state proceedings because the two prosecutions did not involve the &quot;same offense.&quot; The prosecutions were based on separate and distinct federal and state statutes. Moreover, &sect; 1952 contained an element, use of interstate facilities, that was not an essential element of the state charges, so prosecution was also allowed under N.Y. Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petitions were denied because the state prosecutions would not violate petitioners' or intervenor's double jeopardy rights since they were not being prosecuted for the &quot;same offense&quot; as under the federal prosecution; while the overt acts were the same, the prosecutions were based upon separate and distinct statutes of two different sovereigns and the federal statute included an essential element not present in the state statutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The prosecution of petitioners and the intervenor (defendants) under an indictment returned in Queens County charging conspiracy and bribery and related crimes is not barred by reason of double&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jeopardy by their prosecution in Federal court in which their conviction for an alleged violation of section 1952 of title 18 of the United States Code was reversed.  That reversal was based on the prosecution's failure to provide the &quot;Federal&quot; element, i.e., to establish that defendants used a facility in interstate or foreign commerce for purposes listed in section 1952 in a sufficiently meaningful way to subject them to liability under the statute.  While the overt acts or transactions are substantially the same in both prosecutions, the prosecutions are not the same in law because they are based on separate and distinct statutes.  Defendants are being prosecuted for two different offenses based on the same act or criminal transaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The doctrine underlying decisions of the Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Bartkus </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Illinois</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (359 U.S. 121) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Abbate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (359 U.S. 187) known as separate or dual sovereignty has not been discarded but is still a viable doctrine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The present situation falls within the exception in paragraph (f) of subdivision 2 of CPL 40.20 which provides that a person may be separately prosecuted for two offenses based on the same act or criminal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transaction if a prosecution in another jurisdiction has been terminated by an order founded on the insufficiency of the evidence to establish some element of the offense.  The Federal offense was terminated on the ground of insufficient evidence to show use of interstate facilities, which is not an essential element of the crimes in the State prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Paragraph (f) is not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection.  That defendants are treated differently than a defendant who is acquitted by a jury does not make such treatment unconstitutional.  New York has expanded the protection against double jeopardy by statute and the fact that some persons benefit thereby while defendants do not is no basis for a claim that they are being denied constitutional rights.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner father brought a proceeding, pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 232, against respondent city, seeking to secure an order for payment of tuition, transportation, and maintenance costs with respect to his physically handicapped child. The Family Court, Bronx County (New York) entered judgment allowing only tuition expenses during the school year. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father brought the proceeding after his child was placed in a special school. At a hearing before the family court, the father asserted any requirement for contribution on his part was a violation of equal protection. He also challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 232, 234, asserting a denial of equal protection because parents of other handicapped children were not required to contribute support. In its decision the family court stated maintenance expenses were the responsibility of the child's family. No reason was given for disallowance of tuition expenses for the summer months. On appeal, the city conceded the family court should not have denied tuition costs for the summer months and should have allowed the application for maintenance. Also on appeal, the court modified the family court's judgment because an award of summertime tuition was appropriate and a determination as to the allocation of maintenance was necessary. The court, however, affirmed the judgment in part because there was rational basis for differentiating between blind and deaf children and children with other handicaps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment to provide for the payment of tuition costs for the summer months, increased the amount allowed for transportation and tuition costs, reversed the denial of maintenance costs, and remanded for determination of the amount charged for maintenance costs and the amount of contribution.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding brought pursuant to Family Court Act ( &sect;&sect; 232, 234) to secure an order for payment for the months of March through August of 1973 of tuition, transportation and maintenance costs with respect to a physically handicapped child who had been placed in a special school, the Family Court erred in failing to allow maintenance costs.  Such costs are properly includible as an item of educational service, together with tuition and transportation costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent City of New York properly concedes that the Family Court should not have denied tuition costs for the months of July and August, 1973.  The authority of the Family Court to make a &quot;suitable order&quot; whenever a physically handicapped child appears to be in need of educational service is not limited by the boundaries of the conventional school year of September through June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  parent challenges the constitutionality of the statute ( Family Ct. Act, &sect;&sect; 232, 234) on the ground that it denied him equal protection of the law because parents of other handicapped youngsters, such as blind and deaf children, are not required to contribute to their support.  There is a rational basis for differentiating between blind and deaf children and children with other type handicaps and no invidious discrimination results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner asserts that it is the duty of the State to provide a free education.  The nature of the special educational training suitable for the needs of a physically handicapped child may well serve as a rational basis for distinguishing it from the common or public school training. There is no constitutional infirmity prohibiting the Family Court from directing the petitioner, as one chargeable for the support of the child, to contribute to maintenance costs, if he is financially able to do so.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, an aid recipient, appealed a judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term in Nassau County (New York), which denied her application under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. The recipient sought to: (1) annul a determination of respondent Department of Social Services of the State of New York, which affirmed the reduction of her public assistance grant; and (2) to declare unconstitutional&nbsp;N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 352.3(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The recipient's shelter allowance was reduced because her landlord refused to provide verification of his mortgage. The recipient rented one room in a family dwelling. Also residing in the residence were the landlord, his children, and two other tenants. Section 352.3 provided that for children or adults in receipt of public assistance residing in the home of a self-maintaining non-legally responsible relative or friend, the allowance for rent and/or other shelter costs was computed on a prorated basis. The trial court held that &sect; 352.3(c) was not violative of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, because it did not contravene 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.90(a). On review, the court disagreed. Section 233.90(a) provided that the inclusion in the family, or the presence in the home, of a substitute parent or any individual was not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming the availability of income by the State. The court held that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 352.3(c) violated the Supremacy Clause and was, therefore, unconstitutional. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment, which denied the recipient's petition, was reversed with disbursements. The Department's determination to reduce the recipient's public assistance grant was annulled and the Regulations of the Department of Social Services of the State of New York at issue were declared unconstitutional. The court directed that the recipient's shelter allowance be reinstituted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision (c) of section 352.3 of the Regulations of the State Department of Social Services, which provides that, for persons in receipt of public assistance residing in the home of a self-maintaining, nonlegally responsible relative or friend, shelter allowance costs shall be computed on a prorated basis, is violative of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (art. VI, cl. 2).  That subdivision sanctions that which section 233.90 (subd. [a]) of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations prohibits, i.e., the &quot;inclusion in the family, or the presence in the home, of * * * any individual * * * is not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming the availability of income&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the purpose of the State regulation may be to forbid a non-eligible individual from indirectly receiving State assistance from a qualified recipient by living with that person, the result is to reduce the rental stipend for those who are eligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The argument that the purpose of the State regulation, to assure that the qualified recipient is not receiving additional support from the person with whom she is living, does not contravene the Federal regulation is without merit.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, petitioner whose shelter allowance was reduced by 100% following the birth of a child to her, the father being her landlord's son, is entitled to have her shelter allowance reinstated.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare of the United States is not a necessary party to the proceeding since it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was not sought to cut off all Federal funds.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant restaurant owners sought review from a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which dismissed their application pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to vacate a determination of appellees, the public service commission (PSC) and others, ordering that gas service to the restaurant be discontinued unless the restaurant stopped using unmantled gas lamps in violation of N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The restaurant owners challenged the order requiring discontinuance of service based on arguments contesting the authority of the PSC and the appropriateness of the order and proceedings resulting in the order. The court found that: (1) under N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66, the authority of the PSC over wasteful devices and practices with respect to the consumption of natural gas extended beyond uses by industrial and manufacturing concerns; (2) the statute created an adequate standard of review because the standard of wastefulness was neither vague nor indefinite; (3) there had been no evidence offered to contest the finding that the unmantled gas lamps used more gas than mantled gas lamps; and (4) the denial of an evidentiary hearing had been proper where the act of banning unmantled lamps had been legislative in nature and did not deprive the restaurant owners of their property, but rather merely imposed reasonable restrictions on future uses of gas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment dismissing the application to vacate the determination ordering the discontinuance of gas service absent compliance with restrictions on the use of gas lamps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public utilities -- discontinuance of gas service -- Public Service Commission properly directed utility company to discontinue gas service to petitioners' restaurant unless natural gas lamps used therein were extinguished or converted by installation of mantles (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Service Law, &sect; 66</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 2) -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is proper delegation of legislative authority -- lamps used in petitioners' restaurant are &quot;decorative lamps&quot; within definition in PSC order -- examination by Appellate Division satisfied requirement of review of prohibition of wasteful devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Public Service Commission (PSC) properly directed Consolidated Edison Company of New York to discontinue gas service to petitioners' restaurant unless natural gas lamps used in the restaurant were extinguished or converted so that mantles&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were installed. Section 66 (subd. 2) of the Public Service Law provides that the PSC may order the curtailment or discontinuance of the use of natural gas for manufacturing or industrial purposes for up to four months if it is established that &quot;the supply of natural gas is not adequate to meet the reasonable demands of domestic consumption and may prohibit the use of natural gas in wasteful devices and practices.&quot; The power given to the PSC in section 66 to prohibit wasteful devices and practices extends beyond uses by industrial and manufacturing concerns and is separate and distinct from the power to order the curtailment or discontinuance of gas usage for industrial purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute creates an adequate standard against which to review the actions of the PSC and is, therefore, a proper delegation of legislative authority. The word &quot;wasteful&quot; is neither vague nor indefinite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The gas lamps used in petitioners' restaurant fall within the definition of &quot;decorative torches&quot; as found in a PSC order of January, 1973, notwithstanding their illuminating function and petitioners have failed to produce any evidence to overcome the determination of the PSC that unmantled gas lamps&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  use more gas than mantled lamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The examination by the Appellate Division has satisfied the requirement of a review of the prohibition of wasteful devices to determine if it was within the power of the PSC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The effect of the order of the PSC is not to deprive petitioners of property since it imposes reasonable restrictions on future uses of gas to be acquired in connection with the lamps. Furthermore, there was no deprivation of any of petitioners' constitutional rights where all facts asserted by petitioners were presented to the PSC before it determined to disallow petitioners' request for an exemption. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner village sought review after the Supreme Court at Special Term in Madison County (New York) denied its motion for a stay of arbitration in an action on a contract with respondent citizen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village enacted an ordinance that set forth rules and procedures for the determination of sewer service charges to be levied against property owners within the corporate limits of the village whose property was connected to the system. The citizen informed the village that the charges proposed to be imposed would require it to move or to construct its own sewage disposal system. The parties entered into negotiations, which resulted in a contract. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the contract was to be submitted to arbitration. The Board of Trustees adopted a resolution declaring the contract void and unenforceable. The citizen served a notice of intention to arbitrate. The village filed a motion for an order staying arbitration, which the trial court denied. The court reversed. In light of the specific restrictions contained in N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 452(2), the village lacked authority to establish sewer rates by contract, and therefore the contract was of no force and effect. Estoppel did not apply because one who made a contract with a municipal corporation was bound to take notice of limitations on its power to contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order that denied the village's motion for a stay of arbitration in a contract dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- sewer rents -- contract between village and respondent establishing special sewage charges pursuant to provisions of village ordinance was of no force and effect; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 452 (subd. 2) of General Municipal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> provides that sewer rents may be established only by local law or ordinance and, therefore, village lacked authority to establish charges by contract -- village cannot be estopped to deny validity of ultra vires contract -- ratification of contract by resolution of Board of Trustees did not satisfy provisions of section 452 -- furthermore, 1972 resolution could be viewed as having repealed 1966 resolution, thus repealing contract and, therefore there would not be contract pursuant to which respondent would have been entitled to arbitration -- motion for stay of arbitration granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A contract entered into in 1966 between the Village of Canastota and respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  establishing a special sewage charge was authorized by a resolution of the Board of Trustees and was made pursuant to a section of a village ordinance giving the board power to waive the general requirements of the ordinance and to assign a special charge by agreement to an industrial user. In December, 1972 the Board of Trustees adopted a resolution declaring the contract void and unenforceable and in March, 1973 respondent served a notice of intention to arbitrate under the terms of the contract.  A motion by the village to stay arbitration should have been granted.  Section 452 (subd. 2) of the General Municipal Law provides that sewer rents may be established and imposed only by local law or ordinance and, therefore, the village lacked authority to establish sewer charges by contract.  Consequently, the 1966 contract was of no force and effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The village cannot be estopped to deny the validity of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contract.  Respondent must be charged to have notice that the village ordinance could not authorize a contract not authorized by section 452.  In entering into the contract, respondent did so at its own risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the Board of Trustees did adopt a resolution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in 1966 adopting the contract, the failure to include resolutions in section 452 (subd. 2), as well as the fact that &quot;resolution&quot; is not included in the definition of village ordinances ( Village Law, &sect; 92), requires the conclusion that ratification of the contract by resolution did not satisfy the provisions of section 452.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Furthermore, the 1972 resolution could only be viewed as a repealer of the 1966 resolution (&sect; 452, subd. 2, fifth sentence), thus repealing the contract as well.  Therefore, there would not have been in existence in 1973 a contract pursuant to which respondent would have been entitled to arbitration. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant manufacturers sought review of decision by respondent Commissioner of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York, which withdrew approval of their gaming devices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturers, who produced games like pinball machines, were granted approval of four samples of such machines by the Commissioner, then manufactured, sold, and installed them around the city. Over a year later, the Commissioner withdrew her approval on advice from a police expert that the machines were prohibited gambling devices, and the manufacturers brought a N.Y. R. Civ. Prac., art. 78 proceeding based on several grounds. On review, the court found that there could be no estoppel against a public body or officer under the facts, that hardship resulting from the Commissioner's corrective action did not change that rule, and that the State of New York had not pre-empted the field. However, it found that the statutory prohibition of the games was unconstitutional because the purpose was interdiction of gambling, but the statutory test distinguishing gambling from amusement, which was based on whether the game's outcome was affected by chance, had no reasonable relationship and application to the evil it was designed to avoid because the court found it difficult to conceive of any device in which the outcome would not be affected in some degree by chance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and granted the relief demanded in the manufacturers' petition, on the law, without costs, and without disbursements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- gambling devices -- section B32-40.0 of Administrative Code of City of New York, designed to prevent use of gambling devices while allowing amusement machines, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> where there is no fair or reasonable connection between test, whether there is element of chance in playing game, and promotion of welfare and safety of society -- accordingly, following withdrawal of approval of pinball machines after one year on ground machines were gambling devices, relief demanded in article 78 petition granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section B32-40.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York which was designed to prevent the use of gambling devices while allowing machines providing amusement is unconstitutional.  The statutory test of whether there is any&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  element of chance in the playing of the game has no relationship to the object to be attained, the interdiction of gambling. The player on the machines manufactured by petitioner can neither gain nor lose as a result of the game. Therefore, there is no fair, just or reasonable connection between said test and the promotion of the welfare and safety of society, the necessary element to validate an exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, where approval of certain devices in the nature of pinball machines, samples of which were submitted by petitioner, was withdrawn after a year upon advice from a police expert to respondent, the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, that the machines were gambling devices and prohibited by the statute, the relief demanded in the petition in a CPLR article 78 proceeding should be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant school district appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which declared a portion of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 511(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional and ordered the reinstatement of plaintiff teacher.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After receiving conflicting recommendations from physicians regarding the teacher's ability to return to work, the school board terminated the tenured teacher's sick leave, and submitted an application for disability retirement to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System. Contending that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 511(1) was unconstitutional insofar as it would permit the teachers' retirement system to terminate a tenured teacher's continued employment without giving the teacher an opportunity for a hearing, the teacher commenced an action seeking to restrain the teachers' retirement system from processing the retirement application. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment ordering that the teacher be reinstated because the failure to grant the teacher a hearing before the termination of his employment was improper. The court reversed the part of the judgment declaring that &sect; 511(1) was unconstitutional because the teachers' retirement system had not yet acted upon the application that was submitted by the school board and the court would not presume that the teachers' retirement system was going to deny the teacher due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the part of the judgment that declared that a statutory provision relating to the involuntary retirement of a tenured teacher was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- tenured teacher who has become blind may not be placed on disability retirement without hearing -- action as to whether State Teachers' Retirement System has power (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Education Law, &sect; 511</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1) to enforce member's retirement without consent for physical disability should have been dismissed as premature in that respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a tenured elementary school teacher, had become blind while on extended sick leave to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obtain medical treatment and, upon making known his desire to return to his teaching post, he was advised that the school board had changed his status to &quot;medical disability retirement&quot;.  Subsequently, upon resolution of the school board, plaintiff's sick leave was terminated and an application for disability retirement was authorized and submitted to the State Teachers' Retirement System.  While no opinion is expressed on plaintiff's blindness as it might affect his teaching competency, the failure to grant him a hearing on that issue before termination of his unemployment was improper and his reinstatement was properly directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is not necessary to resolve the question of whether the Retirement System has the power under section 511 (subd. 1) of the Education Law to enforce a member's retirement without his consent for physical disability since it will not be presumed that the Retirement System would exercise such authority, in an unconstitutional manner, without affording plaintiff an adversary hearing. It is enough to state that the action should have been dismissed as premature in that respect.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner teachers challenged judgments of the New York Supreme Court in Onondaga County, which dismissed their petitions brought under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In separate proceedings, petitioner teachers were each suspended from their teaching positions by respondent school districts without pay, pending the disposition of the charges against them. Petitioners brought proceedings pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 78, alleging that they were denied their procedural and substantive due process rights with respect to the suspension of their pay. The trial court held that article 78 relief was not available and that suspension of pay was appropriate because petitioners could be reimbursed if they were found innocent of the charges against them. The court reversed, holding that upon a balancing of interests, the harm due to suspension of pay outweighed the governmental interest in denying pay. The court held that article 78 was an inappropriate vehicle, but that 3020-1(2) of the Education Law provided procedural due process to petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment on the basis that suspension of pay of petitioner teachers was an inappropriate hardship and that respondent school districts could more easily bear the burden of continuing pay.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff creditor filed a motion, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7102, to direct seizure by a sheriff of certain chattels in the possession of defendant buyers. The supreme court (New York) entered an order that granted the creditor's motion. The buyers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The buyers purchased tractor-trailers from a debtor. Unknown to the buyers, all but one of the tractor-trailers were listed in a security agreement between the debtor and the creditor. On appeal of the order granting the creditor's request for seizure, the buyers contended the seizure statute,&nbsp;N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7102, was unconstitutional; the creditor agreed to look solely to the proceeds if the chattels were sold, thereby waiving its lien on the chattel; and the after-acquired goods and chattels clause in the security agreement did not cover tractors and trailers other than those listed in the security agreement. The court found the buyers had been afforded due process because they had the kind of notice and hearing which was aimed at establishing the validity, or at least the probable validity, of the underlying claim against the alleged debtor before they were deprived of their property. However, the court concluded the order of seizure was improvidently made because there was a serious factual question as to whether the creditor authorized the debtor to sell the chattels free of any liens when the creditor asserted its right to receive the proceeds if the chattels were sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was affirmed, with modifications directing immediate trial of the action and limiting the chattels at issue to those listed in a schedule attached to the financing statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Secured transactions -- &quot;proceeds&quot; -- after-acquired property -- order of seizure -- notation on filed financing statement, &quot;(X) Proceeds&quot;, might mean that creditor authorized debtor to sell chattels (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Uniform Commercial Code, &sect; 9-306</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. [2]); meaning depends on course of dealing, usage of trade, and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> nature of chattels -- in security agreement and in financing statement, after-acquired property clause meant only property acquired as replacement or substitute -- replevin action against debtor's purchasers shall be tried immediately, and meantime they are restrained from transferring or disposing of chattels listed in security agreement -- order of seizure, made on opposing affidavits and oral arguments in which hearing was not requested, accords with constitutional due process (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 7102</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. [d]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to a security agreement pledging the debtor's three tractors and six trailers to secure payment of a loan of $ 23,952.24 in 36 monthly installments, and pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code ( &sect;&sect; 9-401, 9-402), the creditor signed and filed a financing statement with the Secretary of State and with the County Clerk covering &quot;all motor vehicles&quot;, and stating, in the space provided on the official form, &quot;(X) Proceeds&quot;.  Thereafter the debtor sold the tractors and trailers to the defendants.  Then the debtor failed to pay an installment due on the security agreement; and so the creditor called the whole balance due and commenced this replevin action against said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purchasers, and obtained, after a contested motion, an order directing the Sheriff to seize the chattels from the purchasers, upon the creditor's filing a specified undertaking ( CPLR 7102).  But, under the Uniform Commercial Code ( &sect; 9-306, subd. [2]), the creditor's notation on the filed financing statement -- &quot;(X) Proceeds&quot; -- might mean that the creditor authorized the debtor to sell the chattels free of the creditor's lien.  The meaning of the notation depends, at least in New York State, on the course of dealing between the parties, the usage of the trade, the nature of the chattels, etc.  Since, moreover, the defendants' business might well be crippled by such a seizure prior to any judgment in the action, the order of seizure was improvidently granted and cannot stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The security agreement listed the three tractors and the six trailers and stated: &quot;Together with all fixtures, additions, replacements * * * and substitutions * * * and * * * all goods and chattels now in, on or upon the within described premises * * * and * * * which the debtor may hereafter acquire * * * and debtor agrees to execute * * * such instruments * * * as may be required by the holder of this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mortgage to create a valid lien thereon&quot;; and the financing statement, as permitted by the security agreement, stated that it covered &quot;all motor vehicles &amp; attachments now owned or hereafter acquired&quot;.  These words do not include an additional trailer which the debtor subsequently acquired and which was not a replacement of any of the six specified trailers. The order should not have directed the Sheriff to seize this additional trailer, too, from the debtor's purchasers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Only the portion of the order which restrains the defendants from meantime transferring or disposing of the specified three tractors and six trailers shall stand; and, since such vehicles constantly depreciate and are in daily danger of damage, the replevin action shall be tried immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The order of seizure was made in accord with constitutional due process (cf.  CPLR 7102, subd. [d]), since it was made upon due service and undertaking by plaintiff and upon opposing affidavits and oral arguments of defendants' counsel, who did not ask to examine or cross-examine plaintiff's affiants.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Comptroller of the State of New York challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which granted petitioner property owner's application, in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, for a judgment directing the Comptroller to pay an additional sum of post-judgment interest, on a judgment by the Court of Claims awarding damages for the State's appropriation of the owner's real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Claims allowed the owner, in accordance with N.Y. Court of Claims Act &sect; 20(7), for 20 days after the time to appeal the judgment expired. The owner, however, demanded further interest from the day following entry of judgment to payment of the award. The Special Term held that &sect; 20(7) of the Act was unconstitutional in that it denied the owner just compensation for its property by limiting the interest, and ruled that the owner was entitled to the further interest. The court noted that a person with a legal claim against the state was required seek out the appropriate state official and properly present his claim and vouchers, to be entitled to his money, therefore, interest was allowed for a 20-day period after entry of judgment to enable a claimant to obtain the necessary papers. The questioned statute, therefore, served a legitimate purpose. The court also noted that the owner neglected to file a certified copy of its judgment with the Comptroller as required by &sect; 20(6) of the Act. The court held that any delay in payment and resultant loss to the owner could be attributed its own laxity, and not to the unconstitutional denial of just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment awarding additional post-judgment interest was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- interest on judgment -- limitation on post-judgment interest on judgment of Court of Claims from date of judgment until &quot;twentieth day after the comptroller is authorized to issue his warrant for the payment thereof&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Court of Claims Act, &sect; 20</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 7) is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as depriving petitioner of just compensation for appropriation of its real property -- initiative for payment of claim must be that of claimant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The limitation upon post-judgment interest on a judgment of the Court of Claims found in subdivision 7 of section 20 of the Court of Claims Act, which provides for such interest from the date of the judgment &quot;until the twentieth day after the comptroller is authorized to issue his warrant for the payment thereof or until payment, if payment is made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sooner&quot;, is not unconstitutional as depriving petitioner of just compensation for the appropriation of its real property. Petitioner neglected to file a certified copy of its judgment with the Comptroller, a prerequisite to its receiving payment. Therefore, any delay in payment and resulting loss to petitioner can be traced to its own laxity and not to an unconstitutional denial of just compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A person with a claim against the State must seek out the appropriate State official and present his claim and vouchers to be entitled to his money.  Interest is therefore allowed for a 20-day period after entry of judgment to enable a claimant to obtain the necessary papers, after which it is denied, to prevent the drawing of interest indefinitely upon a claim not presented within a reasonable time. Consequently, absent the requisite initiative by a claimant, the State cannot be in default on its payment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff real property owners sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court, Greene County (New York), which dismissed their complaint in an action for a declaratory judgment that defendant state power authority's activities on the property owners' land was an illegal trespass and for a permanent injunction and set forth a declaration of rights in favor of the state power authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state power authority entered the land of the real property owners for the purpose of making seismological and subsurface examinations of the property. The real property owners brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the authority's activities constituted an illegal trespass and that N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1007(8) was unconstitutional in that it provided for a taking of private property for public use without compensation. The lower court granted the authority's motion to dismiss. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the judgment with modifications. The court found that the entry on the land was not a taking in the constitutional sense. The court held that &sect; 1007(8) was not unconstitutional because the authority assured the property owners that it would compensate them for any damage. However, the court found that the action for a declaratory judgment should not be dismissed merely because, on the face of the allegations, it would appear that the property owners were not entitled to a declaration of rights.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 8 of section 1007 of the Public Authorities Law, which provides that the Power Authority of the State of New York and its agents and employees may enter upon private property for the purpose of making surveys to determine whether such property would be a proper site for an electric generating facility, is constitutional. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such surveys are not the takings of property in the constitutional sense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent instituted hearings to consider the issue of the undergrounding of electric and telephone facilities. After the hearings, a hearing examiner issued a recommendation proposing mandatory undergrounding rules, which respondent adopted. After the rules were adopted a number of requests for exemptions were received. Petitioners' application for extension was denied. On appeal, the court confirmed the determination of respondent, holding that respondent was authorized to prescribe the terms and conditions under which utility companies could extend their lines, who bore the costs of those terms and conditions, and the appropriate charge for those services. It held that because respondent's determination was designed to improve the quality of service to the consuming public it was in the furtherance of the public interest, and thus, it fulfilled the legislative directive of N.Y.

The court found that although the regulations treated petitioners differently, the regulations were not arbitrarily discriminatory and a rational basis existed for the distinction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Public Service Commission is authorized generally to prescribe&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the terms and conditions under which utilities shall extend their lines, the manner in which costs shall be borne and the appropriate charges for such service (Public Service Law, &sect; 65, subd. 1, &sect; 66, subd. 2; &sect; 5, subd. 2).  Consequently, the commission has the authority to mandate that the extensions of electric and telephone distribution lines to most new residential subdivisions be placed underground for aesthetic reasons alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The commission's undergrounding determination was designed to effect an improvement in the quality of service rendered to the public and, thus, was in furtherance of the &quot;public interest&quot; as required by the Public Service Law. The determination, therefore, effectuates the legislative direction which provides adequate standards to guide the commission in the exercise of its powers.  The delegation of those powers by the Legislature is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The determination, rules and regulations of the commission are supported by substantial evidence, that the undergrounding was aesthetically preferable and that the costs were not unduly burdensome and met the test of reasonableness, and are neither arbitrary nor without rational basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The regulations are not arbitrarily discriminatory as between home builders and developers with respect to the payment of costs and the refund thereof.

The appeals court reversed the conviction because the viewing at the jailhouse was clearly improper, and this improper identification testimony bolstered the testimony of the two backup officers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation owned real property within the town. For four consecutive years, the town enacted local laws prohibiting any use of property for anything except residential purposes unless a variance was approved. The subject ordinances were denominated as interim or stop-gap legislation to maintain the status quo pending a comprehensive zoning ordinance. The corporation had attempted to obtain permission for a commercial use of its property and, after refusal, brought an action for a declaratory judgment that the local law restricting uses was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the corporation's request for summary judgment. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the purpose of stop-gap zoning was to allow a local legislative body, pending decision upon the adoption of a comprehensive zoning ordinance, to take reasonable measures temporarily to protect the public interest until an ordinance was adopted. The town's course of conduct was contrary to the purpose of interim or stop-gap zoning. The absence of justification for such an exercise of power rendered the four-year delay unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A 1972 ordinance of the Town of Gardiner prohibiting the use of certain property for anything except residential purposes unless a variance was approved by the Town Board is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and void. Starting in 1968 the town had annually enacted similar ordinances denominated as interim legislation to maintain the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">status quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pending the preparation and enactment of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  comprehensive ordinance.

Consequently, the four-year delay was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A comprehensive plan is essential to proper permanent zoning. The purpose of stop-gap zoning is to allow the local legislative body, pending decision upon the adoption of a comprehensive ordinance, to take reasonable measures temporarily to protect the public interest and welfare until an ordinance is finally adopted.  Otherwise, the eventual comprehensive zoning ordinance might be of little avail.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant bank appealed from the judgment of the lower court that granted plaintiff bank's motion for an injunction pendente lite restraining said defendant from maintaining the business of a savings bank within a certain shopping mall in New York. That judgment also denied defendant's cross-motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The court modified and affirmed the lower court's judgment through a grant of summary judgment to plaintiff. Defendant argued that the new banking law was to operate retroactively and that it made null and void such restrictive covenants. The covenant was a reasonable restriction because defendant could open up a short distance from the mall. Defendant's contention, that the restrictive covenant impaired the regulatory powers of the State Banking Department, was without merit. Plaintiff argued that the new banking law was unconstitutional. The statute was unconstitutional when applied retroactively under the circumstances because no emergency had been shown warranting such application. To give it that effect would have permanently, and without compensation, destroyed a valuable property right possessed by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

Absent any public emergency, this valid and enforceable covenant cannot constitutionally be annulled retroactively (by Banking Law, &sect; 674-a, subd. 1; cf. &sect;&sect; 10, 29).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder. The intermediary appellate court modified the judgment pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 543 so as to convict him of manslaughter in the first degree. Thereafter, defendant brought a coram nobis proceeding, which was unsuccessful. Defendant then brought a federal habeas corpus proceeding. The federal district court's denial of defendant's application was reversed on appeal. The district court was directed to issue the writ unless defendant was retried because the intermediary appellate court's modification of defendant's conviction had deprived him of his right to a jury trial. Defendant was retried and convicted of second degree murder. Defendant challenged that conviction. On appeal, the intermediary appellate court held that defendant's retrial on the second degree murder charge constituted double jeopardy as the original modification effectively acquitted him of the second degree murder charge. In the exercise of discretion and in the interests of justice, the intermediary appellate court modified the judgment on the law to convict defendant of manslaughter in the first degree and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment, entered on retrial, convicting defendant of second degree murder to convict defendant of first degree manslaughter and remanded the case for resentencing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- former jeopardy -- retrial of defendant on charge of murder in second degree after appellate court modified prior judgment of conviction of murder in second degree to manslaughter in first degree was violation of double jeopardy; judgment of conviction of murder in second degree modified to manslaughter in first degree -- sufficient evidence before Grand Jury to support indictment for murder -- defendant was not denied speedy trial -- introduction of prior testimony of two witnesses did not deprive defendant of right of confrontation -- prior statement voluntarily made is admissible for impeachment purposes despite inadmissibility in People's direct</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> case -- removal of defendant's son by District Attorney after his appearance in court was not improper suppression of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, whose conviction for murder in the second degree was modified by an intermediate appellate court pursuant to section 543 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to manslaughter in the first degree and this modification was overturned by the Federal District Court because it deprived the defendant of his right to a jury trial, was subsequently retried and was convicted for murder in the second degree. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was clearly violated by defendant's retrial on the charge of murder in the second degree as the earlier modification of the judgment of conviction to manslaughter in the first degree had the same finality as that of a verdict of acquittal of the greater charge.  Therefore, the judgment of conviction of murder in the second degree is modified on the law and in the exercise of discretion in the interests of justice to convict defendant of manslaughter in the first degree ( CPL 470.15, subds. 2, 3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There was sufficient evidence before the Grand Jury to support an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  indictment for murder. The receipt of some inadmissible evidence by the Grand Jury does not invalidate the indictment nor does it preclude a retrial upon the indictment following a reversal of the conviction due to the receipt at trial of such evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant was not denied a speedy trial, for both trials which defendant received were provided within constitutional periods measured from the moment they became necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Introduction of prior testimony of two witnesses pursuant to CPL 670.10 did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional right of confrontation.  One of the witnesses was dead, and the other, who was thoroughly cross-examined at the prior trial by capable counsel, was residing in Georgia and refused to honor a New York subpoena.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, criminal defendants with cases pending in a supreme court, filed prohibition proceedings under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, which challenged the constitutionality of provisions of 1973 N.Y. Laws 603. They questioned the validity of the authorization for the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint up to 68 additional judges to the Court of Claims, and the delegation of certain judicial administration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Legislation to deal with a drug emergency through increased penalties and restrictions on plea bargaining were enacted. Chapter 603 allowed the governor to appoint up to 100 court of claims judges, who were to be assigned to the supreme court to handle the increased burden. The initial 16 judges appointed were all assigned to criminal parts of the supreme court. Defendants, in their petition, claimed that the process unconstitutionally allowed the appointment of supreme court judges, who were subject to election, and that delegation of court administration violated constitutional principles of separation of powers. In each proceeding, respondents, appointed court of claims judges, prosecutor, and commissioner of the division of criminal justice services, filed motions to dismiss the petitions. The court granted the motions to dismiss. Defendants had standing to dispute the appointment and assignment of the judges. N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26b provided for temporary assignment to the supreme court of judges of other courts, and the nine-year court of claims term was considered &quot;temporary.&quot; Defendants did not have standing to challenge the duties of the commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the court of claims judges' motions to dismiss the petitions of the two groups of defendants, on the law, without costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- courts and judges -- Governor validly appoints additional Court of Claims Judges, and Appellate Division in Second Department validly assigns them temporarily to Supreme Court, Criminal Term, Kings County -- persons on trial before such Judges do not have standing to attack joint administration of State's judicial resources by Judicial Conference and by Commissioner of Criminal Justice Services appointed by Governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. As part of an emergency program for the control of dangerous drugs, the Legislature (L. 1973, chs. 276, 277, 278) has imposed severe penalties on violators of the narcotic drug laws and has severely restricted plea bargaining; and, as part of a concomitant program to provide the necessary additional judges and moneys and criminal justice services, the Legislature (L. 1973, ch. 603) has authorized the Governor to appoint up to 68 additional Judges of the Court of Claims for the usual nine-year terms (see N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 9), which appointments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  however shall be made before July 1, 1974 and shall not be renewed and shall not be filled if vacancies occur; and further, the Legislature has provided that the efficient application of the State's judicial resources shall be administered jointly by the State Administrator of the Courts, who is an appointee of the Judicial Conference, and by the Commissioner of the Division of Criminal Justice Services, who is an appointee of the Governor.  These additional 68 Judges of the Court of Claims (16 have been appointed so far) are available for temporary assignments by the Appellate Division to sit, as needed, in the Supreme Court (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 26, subd. b) in order to handle an anticipated increase of criminal drug trials and proceedings.  Such assignments by the Appellate Division are truly temporary and are constitutional, even though the Constitution also provides in article VI (&sect; 6, subd. c; &sect; 7, subd. a; &sect; 9) that Justices of the Supreme Court shall be elected, and that in New York City the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction of felony prosecutions, and that the Court of Claims has jurisdiction of claims by or against the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. These proceedings were instituted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under CPLR article 78 in the Appellate Division, Second Department, by persons against whom criminal cases are pending in the Supreme Court, Kings County, before some of the assigned Judges of the Court of Claims.  Although such petitioners have standing to test the right of such appointed Judges to hear their cases, these petitioners lack a direct interest or standing to complain that the statutory provision for a joint administration of the State's criminal justice resources by an appointee of the judiciary and by an appointee of the Governer represents an unconstitutional intrusion by the executive branch of government into the affairs of the judicial branch of government (cf. N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 28).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, these petitions are dismissed, on the law.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In saving the statute's constitutionality, the courts may interpret statutory language so as to preserve the validity of a statute; CPLR 6330 is a remedial statute, civil in nature which should be liberally construed and since the films are pornographic, the likelihood of success is great.  A preliminary injunction should have been granted.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, even though it agreed it was unable to eradicate the censure of the judge and to restrain the members from taking action with respect to the judge's candidacy, because the by-law sought to be enforced by the members was invalid and unenforceable against the judge as a candidate for judicial office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the grand jury was improperly impaneled and that the indictments returned against them were nullities. The court denied the petitions to prohibit trial and granted the county's motion to dismiss with respect to all four defendants. The court found that the trial court, in providing for the additional grand jury to sit from February 1 through May 31, enlarged the February Term of court so that it would terminate on May 31 instead of at the time that the next regular grand jury was to be convened. The court noted that the grand jury was in continuous session throughout the period for which it had been impaneled and the indictments at issue were returned during that period. The court reasoned that because each grand jury term could continue as long as the county judge deemed necessary, N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 190-c(3), and because it was undisputed that the additional grand jury in this case began to function immediately after it was charged by the county judge and actively continued to do so without recess or adjournment until the handing up of the indictments in this case, the position of defendants lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By separate orders for each, the court denied all four defendants' petitions to prohibit their trials. The court also granted, by separate order, the county's motions to dismiss defendants' petitions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administrative Judge for the Ninth Judicial District entered an order on January 18, 1973 which provided that an additional Grand Jury be impaneled &quot;for the February, March, April and May, 1973 Terms of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the County Court of the County of Rockland&quot;.

The senior County Judge impaneled the &quot;February Term&quot; of the additional Grand Jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayers sought review of a decision of respondent state tax commission (commission), which sustained additional corporate franchise tax assessments against the taxpayers. The Supreme Court at Special Term (New York) transferred the case to the court. The proceeding was pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were a foreign corporation doing business in the state and a subsidiary. The subsidiary was a foreign corporation having neither an office nor real or tangible property within New York. The subsidiary's purpose was to provide financing to the parent corporation by purchasing its accounts receivable, and employees or officers of the parent corporation performed all of the subsidiary's activities. The commission issued notices of franchise tax deficiencies to the taxpayers for four fiscal years. The deficiencies were based upon the failure of the parent corporation to report the net income of both it and its subsidiary in combined reports to accurately reflect the parent corporation's income subject to the New York franchise tax. On appeal, the court confirmed the determination of the commission, which sustained additional corporate franchise tax assessments against the taxpayers. The subsidiary had no separate corporate autonomy and was, in reality, merely the finance department of the parent corporation. Thus, the subsidiary's income had to be included with the parent corporation's income for an accurate report of the parent corporation's entire net income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court confirmed the determination of the commission, which sustained additional corporate franchise tax assessments against the taxpayers. The court dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- franchise tax -- net income of petitioner foreign corporation, doing business in New York, and of its wholly owned foreign subsidiary providing financing services was properly required to be included in combined tax report without showing that intercompany transactions were unfair; subsidiary had no separate existence -- issue of constitutionality based on subsidiary's not doing business in New York or being engaged exclusively in interstate commerce is academic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A foreign corporation doing business in New York which organized a wholly owned foreign subsidiary to provide financing, the subsidiary's activities being performed by employees or officers of the parent corporation, was properly required to file a combined report of the income of the two corporations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  derived in New York and to pay a tax thereon under subdivisions 4 and 5 of section 211 of the Tax Law. The purpose of these subdivisions is to prevent the distortion of the net income of a taxpayer.  Such distortion can occur either through intercompany transactions or an unfair agreement.  There is nothing in the statute or its legislative history which mandates a showing that intercompany transactions be unfair as a prerequisite to requiring a combined report.  The State Tax Commission found that the subsidiary had no separate corporate autonomy and was the finance department of petitioner's business, having no separate directors, officers or employees, and owning no separate real or tangible personal property. The subsidiary's income is derived solely from intercompany transactions with petitioner and such income must be included with petitioner's in order to properly reflect the entire net income of petitioner as a New York taxpayer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant State appealed the order of the Supreme Court in Monroe County (New York), which invalidated the State's appropriation of a strip of land on plaintiff's owner's property in the owners action to bar the States claim to the strip of land brought pursuant to N.Y. Real Prop. Act. art. 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appropriated land along the north edge of the properties owned by the owner and his neighbor. As a result, both properties were deprived of access to an abutting street the lands. Thereafter, the State appropriated an additional strip across the edge of the owner's remaining property in order to provide highway access the neighbor's property and to replace the access destroyed by the first appropriation. The owner filed suit to bar the State from any claim to the strip taken in the remedial appropriation. The trial court invalidated the remedial appropriation because it occurred almost two years after the original taking. In reversing the trial court, the court held that N.Y. High. Law &sect; 10(24)(d) did not require the remedial taking to occur simultaneously with or in close temporal proximity to the first taking. There was ample justification for the time lapse between the two takings, and the neighbor's access left after the first appropriation was clearly unsuitable. Thus, the State was justified in effecting the remedial appropriation under &sect; 10(24)(d) to re-establish access to the neighbor's property by the taking of an inconsequential portion of the owner's land.</SPAN></P>

That the commission was of a temporary nature was best demonstrated by the fact of its limited duration in time. Furthermore, a legislative enactment carried with it an exceedingly strong presumption of constitutionality, and, while this presumption was rebuttable, petitioner's heavy burden had to be fulfilled by demonstrating unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and it was only as a last resort that a reviewing court would strike down a legislative enactment on this ground.

The court noted that under applicable state statute the sole remedy to challenge tax assessments on the ground of illegality or irregularity was to seek judicial review of the assessments. The court found that the thrust of the taxpayers' complaints were directed to the great percentage increases in their properties' assessments which were adopted by the town assessor in reliance on the recommendations of the expert. The court held that under these circumstances, there was no basis for a judicial declaration that the contract providing for arbitration of disputes relating to taxpayers' realty taxes was illegal or unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which, in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed an action against the State of New York after the State assessed an additional tax against his gross income for amounts that were not distributed to shareholders of a New York corporation that elected to be treated under subchapter S. The court affirmed. The court noted that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 612(a) defined the New York adjusted gross income of a resident individual as his federal adjusted gross income as defined in the laws of the United States for the taxable year modified by certain specified items. The court held that the taxpayer's assertion that he stood in danger of being taxed a second time when such income was actually distributed in the form of dividends was groundless because such a distribution was not included in federal adjusted gross income, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1375(d), and therefore would not have been included in his New York adjusted gross income.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- personal income tax -- shareholder of electing subchapter S corporation which paid no Federal income tax improperly deducted from his adjusted gross income for State tax purposes undistributed gross income of corporation in amount of $ 8,279.97 on which he paid Federal tax; State Tax Commission properly assessed him for deficiency -- portion of State Constitution providing that &quot;undistributed profits shall not be taxed&quot; does not prohibit tax on income not received -- no unreasonable discrimination against shareholders of subchapter S corporations exists -- petitioner will not be taxed twice -- Legislature did not intend to exclude subchapter S concept from operation of New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner owned stock in a subchapter S small business corporation (U. S. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Code, tit. 26, &sect; 1371 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) which had elected to pay no Federal income tax, but its shareholders were required to report as gross income their pro rata shares of the taxable income upon which the corporation would have been taxed but for the election, regardless of whether or not such income had actually been distributed to the shareholders. Petitioner included $ 8,279.97 as gross income on his 1962 Federal return, which amount was not distributed to him.  Because of subdivision 9 of section 208 of the Tax Law which provides that corporations which have elected to be taxed under subchapter S shall not be treated as having made such an election for New York tax purposes, the corporation was taxed. Under subdivision (a) of section 612 of the Tax Law, the New York adjusted gross income of a resident individual is &quot;his federal adjusted gross income&quot;.  Petitioner deducted the $ 8,279.97 of corporate income which had not been distributed to him from his adjusted gross income for State tax purposes.  Respondent Tax Commission's disallowance of the deduction and the assessment of a deficiency against him was properly confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The purpose of the last sentence of section 3 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  article XVI of the State Constitution which reads &quot;Undistributed profits shall not be taxed&quot; is not to prohibit the imposition of a tax on income not received but to prohibit the imposition of penalties on corporations for excessive accumulations of earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The imposition of a tax on undistributed income does not unjustly discriminate against shareholders of subchapter S corporations.  Shareholders in electing subchapter S corporations have a more direct beneficial interest in their pro rata share of corporate earnings than shareholders in other corporations.  The discrimination therefore has a rational basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner will not be taxed a second time when such income is actually distributed as dividends for such a distribution is not included in Federal adjusted gross income (U. S. Code, tit. 26, &sect; 1375, subd. [d]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Legislature did not intend, in imposing a tax on subchapter S corporations at the corporate level, to exclude the subchapter S concept entirely from the operation of the New York statute because section 632 of the Tax Law, in defining the adjusted gross income of nonresident individuals further provides in paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) thereof&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that &quot;[for] a nonresident individual who is a shareholder of [an electing subchapter S corporation] * * * (A) undistributed taxable income shall not constitute income or gain derived from New York sources&quot;.  No such exception appears in the modifications to adjusted gross income codified in section 612.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, former and current police department employees, sought review of decisions by the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York) in a consolidated appeal. The first and second employees challenged decisions regarding the computation of their retirement allowances by respondent comptroller. The third set of employees challenged a decision regarding the constitutionality of N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 431.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first employee had his &quot;final average salary&quot; computed by including all compensation received during his final three years of employment. The comptroller recomputed it, using only three days per year. The second employee had his &quot;final average salary&quot; computed with no inclusion of accumulated sick pay or a lump sum cash payment for termination pay. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 302(9)(b) required that termination pay be limited to that earned during the three-year period. The court also found that the first employee did not have a contractual right to payments as previously computed and that &sect;&sect; 333 and 341(j) prohibited the inclusion of the second employee's sick pay. The third set of current employees entered into a collective bargaining agreement prior to the enactment of &sect; 431. The court held that sick pay could not be included as noted above and vacation pay only included at the rate previously determined by the comptroller. However, the court modified the decision and held that &sect; 431&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived them of their contractual right to have termination pay included but noted termination pay should be included at the rate previously discussed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's decision regarding the computation of the first and second employee's retirement benefits. The court modified the decision regarding the third set of employees and held that the statutory provision was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited the inclusion of termination pay in the &quot;final average salary&quot; but affirmed the balance of the decision with respect to sick pay and vacation pay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Retirement and Social Security Law ( &sect; 302, subd. 9, par. b) defines &quot;Final average salary&quot; as the &quot;highest average annual compensation earned during any three consecutive years of member service&quot;.  &quot;Annual compensation&quot; is defined (Retirement and Social Security Law, &sect; 302, subd. 2, par. a) as the &quot;wages annually earnable by a member&quot;.  A patrolman employed by a county police department for over 20 years retired on February 23, 1970.  His union had entered into a contract with the county whereby, upon retirement after 20 years of service, a patrolman was entitled to a lump sum payment for termination pay computed on the basis of three days' pay for each year of completed service.  In computing the patrolman's &quot;final average salary&quot;, respondent included the lump sum payment for all his years of service but two years later recomputed the final average salary by including only nine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  days' termination pay, three days for each of the last three years.  Termination pay could be treated as having been earned in the 20th year of service only if such pay was a component of compensation for the 20th year alone.  Since termination pay must be treated as earned over the 20-year period rather than in the 20th year, respondent correctly determined that the amount &quot;earned during [the last] three consecutive years&quot; (&sect; 302, subd. 9, par. b) is that amount representing three years' worth of termination credits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By computation of the retirement benefit so as to include for two years the full amount of the termination pay in final average salary, no contract has been established requiring the inclusion of full termination pay in the computation of final average salary. Respondent's inclusion of the full payment was lacking in legal authority and cannot rise to the status of a contract.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Kranker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Levitt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 30 N Y 2d 574, distinguished.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As to employees who were members of the retirement system prior to the effective date of section 431 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, which forbids the inclusion of any form of termination pay in the salary base for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  computing retirement benefits, and who receive, upon retirement, termination pay pursuant to contracts effective prior to that date, the inclusion of termination pay on an entitlement basis of three years in the computation of &quot;final average salary&quot; under paragraph b of subdivision 9 of section 302 constitutes a contract the benefits of which cannot be diminished or impaired by virtue of section 7 of article V of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since a resolution had not been adopted by the County Police Department pursuant to section 333 of the Retirement and Social Security Law granting its employees the right to include sick leave pay in final average salary, sick leave credits in any form could not be taken into consideration.  Moreover, by the inclusion in subdivision j of section 341 of the provision that sick leave shall not &quot;be considered in computing final average salary&quot;, the Legislature intended to prohibit the inclusion of sick leave payments in final average salary regardless of whether the source of the payments was a collective bargaining agreement or a resolution adopted pursuant to section 333 of the Retirement and Social Security Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The collective bargaining agreement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the union and the Police Department allowed the employees to accrue unused vacation pay to a maximum of 60 days.  The limitation to 60 of the number of unused vacation days for which a lump sum payment will be made does not bear any reasonable relation to the actual number of unused vacation days which are &quot;earned&quot; in any given year of service.  Therefore that limitation should similarly bear no relation to the maximum number of days of vacation credit which can be included in the determination of final average salary. The contract benefits which are constitutionally protected from impairment by section 431 are similarly limited to those which were so protected under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Kranker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Levitt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (30 N Y 2d 574). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The five architects were members of architectural firms employed by a county in connection with its proposed domed stadium. Simultaneous and independent investigations were made by federal and state grand juries and each architect indicated his intention to refuse to testify on U.S. Const. amend. V grounds. While the State excused them as witnesses, the federal authorities compelled two of the architects' testimony by offering immunity under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2514. After testifying, the State filed an indictment against the architects, charging them with conspiracy to bribe and bribery, and the trial court dismissed the indictment. On appeal, the court held that because there was there was a showing that the grant of immunity under &sect;2514 was necessary and proper, it did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the police powers granted to the states in U.S. Const. amend. X. The court found that the order dismissing the indictment against the two architects that testified was affirmed, but determined that because the other architects did not testify at the trial, the indictment as to them was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The County Court improperly dismissed the indictment against three other defendants, ordered to testify at a trial in Federal Court and immunized from prosecution based upon their trial testimony, who gave no such testimony but did subsequently testify before the Federal Grand Jury, because the immunity order granted for trial testimony cannot be extended to cover the Grand Jury testimony; the immunity is not conferred by court order alone but by testifying at the time and place directed by the order.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, property owners and a park commission, sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court, Rockland County (New York), which confirmed a determination of respondent Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Orangetown, New York granting an application by respondent-intervenor manufacturer for a special permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer sought a special permit to build a plant for the manufacturing of metal chains for chandeliers and lamps. The manufacturer's property was zoned &quot;LO&quot; to permit light manufacturing upon the issuance of a special permit. &quot;LO&quot; zoning allowed such uses as office buildings, laboratories, schools, municipal parking lots, public parks, and a few other specified uses. A county planning board recommended that the manufacturer's application for a special permit be denied, but the zoning board approved the special permit. The petitioners sought judicial review, and the trial court confirmed the zoning board's determination. On appeal, the court reversed and annulled the zoning board's determination. The court noted that while its review was limited to whether the zoning board's determination was supported by substantial evidence, the manufacturer had not shown that its proposed factory would not adversely affect the character of the area, which included historic mansions and parks and was rural, residential, and recreational, or that it would be for light manufacturing in harmony with the zoning scheme; rather, a chain factory would sharply alter the character of the area.</SPAN></P>
