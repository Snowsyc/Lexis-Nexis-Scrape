When called to testify, H refused to answer any questions and the trial court found that she was not a competent witness. On appeal, defendant argued that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the testimony of the pediatrician and of S, which established that both girls were molested, was sufficient to support the verdict. The court also held that S's testimony was properly admitted under the Child Hearsay Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-3-16, and that her testimony that she saw defendant molest H was sufficient to convict defendant. Thus, the motion for a directed verdict as to H was properly denied. The court also held that the trial court properly denied a mistrial because the testimony regarding defendant's drug problem was relevant to address defendant's statement that he could only have committed the crimes if he were on drugs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant poured gasoline onto a bed occupied by his wife and two stepchildren and that he then ignited the gasoline. A jury convicted him of three counts of aggravated assault and one count of criminal damage to property in the first degree. The court affirmed, determining that the trial court did not err in discounting defendant's testimony and finding that defendant's custodial statement was freely and voluntarily made. The trial court was not required to charge the jury on the subject of the voluntariness of defendant's confession where defendant did not make a specific request for such a charge. The trial court's jury instruction on defendant's flight could have reasonably been read as a &quot;permissive inference&quot; rather than a &quot;mandatory presumption&quot; where the charge did not require the jury to infer guilt from defendant's flight but merely suggested that guilt may be taken into consideration as having a tendency to establish guilt. Consequently, the trial court's charge on flight was not unconstitutionally burden shifting. The trial court's charges on aggravated assault were accurate statements of the law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant gave conflicting stories about what had happened to the child. Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence and in charging the jury. The court held that the testimony of three doctors, a nurse, and investigators in the sheriff's department who were specially trained in child abuse cases was sufficient to support the verdict. The testimony of sheriff department investigators and the doctors who treated the child was properly admissible. The trial court properly instructed the jury that they could infer that a person of sound mind intended the natural consequence of his acts. The trial court was not required to charge the jury on a lesser-included offense because defendant did not request such a charge. The State was not required to produce discovery of evidence that was available to defendant from a neutral third party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A truck driven by defendant ran off the highway. The officer that arrived at the scene and a witness observed that defendant's eyes were bloodshot, his speech was slurred, and he smelled like alcohol. Defendant was given a blood alcohol test at the station and the test revealed a blood alcohol content of .08 grams. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. Defendant alleged that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction; (2) the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the first count of the indictment as failing to charge a DUI offense; and (3) his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court found that his sentence was within the statutory limit. The language in the indictment adequately informed defendant of the charges against him, did not mislead him, and charged according to the DUI statute. The court concluded that there was ample evidence to support the DUI conviction based upon the officer's observations, the witness's observations, and the test results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former commissioners were serving four-year terms as members of the county's board of commissioners and were subsequently removed from office pursuant to a Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 21-4-1 recall election. They had claimed that the recall statute, as enacted, was unconstitutional. As members of the board of commissioners, the former commissioners were entitled to statutorily conferred expense benefits and salaries. However, their salaries and expense benefits had been cut off after their removal from office. On appeal from the judgment in favor of defendants, the court found that the former commissioners were entitled to salaries and benefits as members of the board up to a certain date. However, the judgment had to be affirmed because all actions for the recovery of wages, overtime, or damages and penalties accruing under laws respecting the payment of wages and overtime had to be brought within two years after the right of action had accrued, according to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-22. The former commissioners' action was barred because they did not bring their claims within the two years after their claims had accrued.

The court disagreed. Decisional law established the constitutionality of the rape shield law. An exhibit was properly excluded under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-2-3 as an attack upon the victim's reputation for prior sexual behavior. The trial court did not err by finding a similar transaction admissible considering the similarities in ages of the victims, the similarities in the offenses, and the similarities in the relationship of the victims to defendant. The issue of what was done during the swearing of the witnesses was waived in the absence of an objection at trial. There was no factual premise for the issue of the jury question. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. The sentence was within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A property owner filed suit against the county alleging the county negligently failed to discover and remove an obstruction placed by a power company in its main sewer line after the obstruction caused raw sewage to back up and flood the property owner's home on two different occasions. The county contended that it could not be liable at all because its operation and maintenance of the sewer main, as a nuisance, did not amount to a taking of the owner's property for public use, and thus was not an inverse condemnation. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The court concluded that the county was liable only for not having abated the nuisance, thus it could only be liable for the second sewage backup. As such, the property owner could maintain her action without the necessity to prove an inverse condemnation. The court concluded that the trial court had erred in refusing to allow the jury to consider the question of an award of damages for mental suffering or emotional distress and attorney fees. The court held a settlement payment by the power company was not admissible for the purpose of apportioning damages.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-31, said offense being in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-106(b)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers had received information that a person with defendant's name was selling drugs in a certain area that night. While en route to that area, a radio call was received that a juvenile had discharged a firearm at an address within the area. As the officers arrived, defendant immediately entered an apartment. The officers followed, and defendant ran into a bedroom and threw a pistol down. Because defendant resisted an attempt to frisk him, the officers forcibly restrained, handcuffed, and searched him. On defendant's person was found thousands of dollars in cash of which a large quantity was in small denominations. Keys taken from defendant unlocked two vehicles which a confidential informant at the scene told the officers belonged to defendant and contained drugs. In these cars the officers found significant amounts of cocaine. The court held that: (1) the trial court's failure to require disclosure of the confidential informant did not violate his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to confrontation; (2) the trial court's jury instructions were proper; (3) the officers had probable cause to search the cars for drugs; and (4) ample evidence supported defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

When the adoptive child's custodian discovered the hospital's error almost five years later, she filed a petition to adopt the adoptive child that she had raised since birth, and she sought to recover custody of her natural child. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, finding that it erroneously granted the adoption petition of the adoptive child's custodian without any legal basis. The statute cited by the trial court, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-8-6(b) was only applicable to adoption proceedings brought by a stepparent or relative. The adoptive child's custodian was not a stepparent or other relative, and the relevant statutory law disclosed no provision that would authorize the trial court to grant her petition.</SPAN></P>

He was arrested for driving with a suspended license and the car was impounded. After conducting a search, the officer discovered cocaine in a box on the passenger side of the floorboard. Defendant's motion to suppress the contraband was denied. On appeal, he contended that the initial stop was pretextual and without probable cause or articulable suspicion in violation of the federal and state constitutions and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-5-1. Defendant further contended that the noise ordinance was federally unconstitutional on its face and as applied. The court held that the trial court's refusal to suppress the evidence was proper because: (1) the initial stop was not to search for drugs, (2) the officer had an articulable suspicion of prohibited conduct to stop defendant, (3) there was probable cause for arrest on the suspended license charge, and (4) the officer was authorized to search the passenger compartment as a result of the lawful arrest and the necessity to impound the car.

The adjoining property lessee appealed from the award of attorney fees and the property owner appealed from the denial of his motion for summary judgment. The court held that the lower court could not award attorney fees as an additional measure of damages because there was no finding of bad faith on the part of the adjoining property lessee. The court concluded that the property owner's motion for summary judgment was properly denied because the motion was based on the alleged need for a zoning variance when in fact there was no need for a variance after the building permit was secured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the police officer was hired by the city, he agreed to reimburse to the city the costs of his required training if he failed to complete 12 months of employment after graduating from the training program. The police officer voluntarily terminated his employment prior to the expiration of the 12 month training period, and the city filed an action to recover the costs it had expended. The trial court granted judgment to the police officer on the ground that the contract contravened public policy, and the city appealed. The court reversed, holding that contracts should not be avoided on public policy grounds unless the legislature declared it to be so, the consideration was contrary to good morals, or it was an agreement to do something in violation of the law. Although &sect; 35-8-9 required that the training be completed by the police officer and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 35-8-17 authorized a civil action by a police officer against a city for failure to comply with the certification requirements, the court found no intent to impose the financial burden of such training solely on an employer of police officers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for an acquittal because the answers to whether or not the victims collaborated on their testimony and whether or not there was material conflict in the evidence were governed by determination of the credibility of the victims and other witnesses. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-3-16, the child hearsay statute, did not violate the right to confrontation under the United States Constitution. Nor was admission of witness testimony under that statute violative of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments where the appropriate procedure was followed to introduce out-of-court declarations by the children and the statements' reliability was supported, as required. There was no error in the trial court's refusal to allow certain surrebuttal testimony because there was no evidence that the proffered witness was present during any pertinent conversations. Finally, the jury charge was proper where the charge encouraged each juror not to yield his or her honest conviction.</SPAN></P>

After the hearing, the trial court denied the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the court reviewed the record at which defendant had argued that his counsel was ineffective and concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant's trial counsel was not so ill prepared that he failed to understand the factual claims or the legal significance thereof, or the basic procedural requirements applicable in trial, even though another attorney might have tried the case differently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to unlawful possession for controlled substances. In three pro se appeals, he challenged his conviction and the sentence. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to appoint a special investigator, erred in finding that defendant's arrest was based upon probable cause, and erred in finding that the impoundment and inventory of his vehicle were proper. The police were called to a hotel after defendant was &quot;evicted&quot; and hotel employees found drug paraphernalia in the hotel room. Police later received a call that defendant had returned to the hotel. A police officer went to the hotel and confronted and arrested defendant in the manager's office. An inventory of defendant's car revealed a tote bag containing bags of cocaine. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence because the impoundment of defendant's car was valid and it was not necessary that defendant have possible access to the vehicle. The court held that defendant was not, as he suggested, entitled to be allowed to get in the vehicle and move it to a safer location or to arrange to have it removed. The court found no merit in defendant's other contentions.</SPAN></P>

Both defendants appealed. As to the first defendant, the court affirmed the conviction for filing a false insurance claim but reversed the RICO conviction, finding that there was improper venue. The court determined that venue under RICO, premised upon a predicate act of mail fraud, could be placed only in counties from which, to which, or through which such mailings occurred. The court concluded that there was no evidence of any mail as alleged in the mail fraud predicate act from, to, or through the county in which the case was heard. As to the other defendant, the court reversed the RICO conviction, finding that it was error to allow defendant's character witness to be cross-examined concerning accusations of prior arrests, convictions, and uncharged specific bad acts without making an offer of proof as to such other conduct. The court found the questioning to be inflammatory and prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

His conviction was vacated in habeas corpus proceedings on the ground that the definition of cocaine trafficking, as set forth in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-31, had been amended between the time of defendant's indictment and the time of his trial to substitute for the words, &quot;any mixture containing cocaine,&quot; the words &quot;any mixture with a purity of 10 percent or more of cocaine,&quot; 1985 Ga. Laws 552. Defendant was re-indicted and again convicted of trafficking in cocaine, this time based on allegations that he did knowingly bring into the state and was knowingly in actual possession of more than 200 grams of cocaine. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant's contention that he was convicted of an offense that did not exist at the time it was committed was without merit because the act of knowingly bringing into the state or being in possession of more than 200 grams of cocaine constituted trafficking in cocaine both before and after the 1985 amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The automobile manufacturer had a franchise and financing agreement with the automobile dealer. The business was not doing well and efforts were made to readjust the position of the parties. Eventually the automobile manufacturer filed an action to obtain a writ of possession and other relief. The automobile dealer answered and counterclaimed. Various motions for summary judgment were filed. The trial court ultimately granted relief to the automobile manufacturer on its franchise related claims and denied relief to the automobile dealer, except as to certain of his claims. On appeal, the court affirmed because there was sufficient compelling evidence under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-56(c) as to the rulings on the various motions. The court noted that the movants had not shown the non-existence of genuine issues of material fact in all but four instances, that the automobile manufacturer had not met the statutory requirements as to the constitutionality of the Motor Vehicle Franchise Practices Act, that evidentiary rulings were not erroneous, and that the judgment for the automobile dealer on three counts and under the Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act was supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

A trial court awarded appellees a sum of money, including damages, interest, attorney fees, and litigation expenses. Appellant sought review of the trial court's judgments. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments. The court found that the trial court properly denied appellant's plea in abatement and motions to dismiss the suit on a defense under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 14-2-310(b)(10) for foreign corporations because appellees did not need a certificate as authority for filing their lawsuit. The court determined that the record showed that the new counsel who entered the case some months before trial occupied the position of lead counsel. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance of the trial contrary to Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-10-155, 9-10-167.

The second defendant was unaware that the first defendant sought a variance and was not present when checks were presented to the public official. The trial court convicted both defendants of bribery of a public official. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction of the second defendant because the evidence was insufficient to authorize a reasonable trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime of bribery of a public official beyond a reasonable doubt. The first defendant was granted a new trial because the trial court's definition of entitled was incomplete and misleading, cash from the checks was erroneously admitted, and defendant was entitled to a hearing on the selective prosecution defense if defendant demonstrated a colorable entitlement.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled a prior case that held that ownership of the premises did not raise a presumption that the owner possessed all property contained therein. The court stated that there was a viable, rebuttable presumption of possession, without regard to gender or marital status, as against the owner or lessee of the premises where contraband was found.

The employer dismissed him due to claimed insubordination in not attending a meeting he was directed to attend. The employee contended the real reason was prohibited discrimination due to his handicap, and he sought a jury trial. The trial court ruled that the action under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 34-6A-6(a), (b) was a nonjury matter because it was unknown at common law, did not arise from a common law right, and required the court to exercise its injunctive powers and, therefore, did not come within any state or federal constitutional rights to jury trial in civil cases. The court affirmed and held that U.S. Const. amend. VII did not apply to suits in state courts. The Georgia constitutional provision merely guaranteed the continuance of the right unchanged as it existed either at common law or by statute. Because the GEEHC created a right and a remedy unknown at common law, the trial court was correct in finding no constitutional right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff appealed, but the court affirmed, using the fair attribution test and concluding that the act of issuing an arrest warrant in response to the rental company's complaint did not convert what was essentially a private collection action into &quot;state action&quot; for the purpose of &sect; 1983. Although the court condemned the practice of using the criminal process to gain an advantage in a civil matter, it did not constitute &quot;state action&quot; so the directed verdict was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

Contrary to defendant's contention that the State lacked jurisdiction over his person, the court explained that the Georgia statutes authorized trial in a state court of offenses in violation of Georgia's traffic code pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-71(b); that a state court was vested with judicial power of the State of Georgia under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; I, par. I; that an indictment was not required, Ga.

Thus, the court held that the lower court had proper jurisdiction over the subject matter and defendant's person. The held also that the lower court did not err in denying defendant's request for a bill of particulars because a bill of particulars was not a recognized pleading in the state of Georgia and the information requested by defendant was not germane to his defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following defendant's conviction for trafficking in cocaine by being in actual possession of more than 28 grams thereof, possession and control of cocaine, with intent to distribute it, and possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, defendant appealed the decision. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress and in overruling defendant's objection to the introduction into evidence certain items that had been seized from her purse. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the officer's prudence did not amount to unconstitutional intrusion on defendant's U.S. Const. amend IV and U.S. Const. amend. XIV right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Further, the court reasoned that checking the purse was not more invasive or less reasonable than checking all purses before allowing persons with public business to enter courthouses. The court held that it was nothing more nor less, than a Terry-type search of the purse. Additionally, the court held that the officer had information that there were weapons at the location.</SPAN></P>

Defendant waived his Miranda rights and made an oral statement admitting he had showed X-rated movies and books to an eight year-old girl and rubbing her vagina and that she had masturbated him. The evidence enabled a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The mother's testimony as to what the seven year-old victim told her on the night in question was admitted in evidence over defendant's objection pursuant to &sect; 24-3-16. Section 24-3-16 did not require that a hearing to determine &quot;indicia of reliability&quot; be held prior to receiving the testimony, and the court could not say that failure to do was error. Showing the X-rated video to the jury as evidence of a &sect; 16-12-103 violation was not error because it was not an entirely unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

The customer argued that the jury's acquittal of her should have been sufficient to resist the merchant's motion for summary judgment in the parties' civil trial. The merchant prevailed. While the existence of probable cause in a malicious prosecution suit was normally a jury question, it could be purely a question of law where the material facts were not in dispute or only one inference could be drawn therefrom. Because the evidentiary standard on a motion for judgment of acquittal was higher than that of mere probable cause, the criminal court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict constituted a binding determination of the existence of probable cause for purposes of the customer's malicious prosecution suit. The customer failed in her argument that the trial court's judgment violated her constitutional rights because she did not obtain a ruling thereon before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were jointly tried on criminal trespass charges for remaining on the premises of a women's health clinic after being asked to leave.

The court rejected defendants' argument that they believed, in good faith, that they were on public property even after a representative of the clinic advised them that they were on private property. The court concluded that defendants had to abide by the consequences of electing to act on their own beliefs rather than upon the requests of the clinic representatives. Actual knowledge of the viability of the owner's property rights was not an essential element of the State's proof for a violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-7-21(b)(3). The State was only required to prove that after having been given proper notice to depart the premises, defendants knowingly and without authority remained on the premises. The court also found that the trial court had not erred in giving certain jury instructions and in refusing to give others where the charge contained correct legal principles and substantially covered the same principles as the requested instructions.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-311(e)(1) did not vest the taxpayer with the right to challenge the board's methodology of assessing property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board determined the percentage of increase or decrease in fair market value of a given piece of residential real property by referring to the average sales price of property within that same neighborhood. Thus, sales were used as a guide to the changing fair market value of a house located in a given neighborhood, and such factors as the actual improvements or damages sustained by individual pieces of property or property location were not directly considered in assessing property as to its fair market value. Rather, the appraised value of each parcel within a given tax neighborhood was increased or decreased by the same percentage factor. The taxpayer's constitutional objections to the board's method of assessment were not considered on the merits of the tax appeal. The court was satisfied that the linchpin to the taxpayer's &sect; 1983 claim was the alleged nonuniform and unequal appraisal procedure approved by the county and implemented by its agents. Accordingly, the &sect; 1983 claim was not cognizable in the action below, and the taxpayer had not been given an opportunity to question the validity of the assessment imposed against his property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment affirming the board's property appraisal and remanded the case with direction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the verdict of guilty but mentally ill was properly found by the jury because defendant failed to prove that at the time of the crime he was mentally ill, but he did prove that he had mental health needs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that service by publication was unconstitutional and contested the sufficiency of the service. The court found that the trial court properly dismissed the action because of the lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiff provided no evidence of unsuccessful attempts to personally serve defendant to support the hearsay conclusions set forth in the affidavit submitted with the motion for service by publication. The sheriff's attempts were made well after plaintiff sought service by publication and, thus, did not serve as a basis for reasonable diligence in attempting to locate defendant prior to seeking constructive service. Additionally, there was no evidence that defendant evaded the process server by secreting himself. There was no error in the denial of plaintiff's motion to add the insurer as a party because the motion was filed months after the two-year statute of limitations, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-33. Further, there was no evidence that the insurer was aware of the action during the period of limitations, and, thus, the amended pleading did not relate back to the date of filing, under Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Chattooga Superior Court (Georgia), which convicted defendant of two offenses of selling cocaine in violation of the Georgia Controlled Substance Act. Defendant alleged that the trial court abused its discretion in the application of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-8-25, 17-8-20, when it refused defendant a continuance when a witness that had been properly subpoenaed failed to appear for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for selling cocaine. Defendant testified at a pretrial hearing that a witness was the true seller of the cocaine and that the witness set defendant up for the crime because the witness was a relative of the police officer and possibly an informant. Defendant properly subpoenaed the witness for trial. When the case was called for trial if was discovered that the witness was in the hospital as the result of a gun shot wound. The trial court denied defendant's motion for continuance and defendant was convicted of two counts of selling cocaine. On appeal, the court reversed the part of the trial court's judgment that denied defendant a continuance because all the statutory factors were present to entitle defendant to a continuance and the trial court abused it discretion when it denied defendant's motion. The court also held that defendant lacked standing as a white person to maintain an equal protection claim that the prosecution improperly excluded black jurors from the jury. The court also held that because defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not waived it was harmless error to appoint trial counsel to represent defendant on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the part of the trial court's judgment that denied defendant a continuance. The court affirmed the part of the trial court's judgment that found that defendant's equal protection rights to a fair cross-section of the community in the selection of the jury were not violated. The court affirmed the part of the trial court's judgment that failed to appoint defendant a new attorney for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city and the power company had filed a joint petition for a declaratory order with the PSC to determine which had the right under the Georgia Territorial Electric Service Act (Act) to provide electric service to a new industrial customer. The city had provided electric service to the temporary construction site. The city contended that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 46-3-8(b) granted to it the exclusive right to continue serving the premises because it lawfully provided service to the premises during construction. The city sought to extend the temporary provision of electric service to the permanent premises on the basis that it had been &quot;grandfathered&quot; into the exclusive right by &sect; 46-3-8(b). The court affirmed the superior court's judgment. The court found that under the city's interpretation, customer choice would be eliminated whenever temporary service was provided to construction sites under other parts of the Act. The court agreed with the PSC's interpretation that providing temporary service to a construction site by one supplier of electric service did not foreclose the large load consumer from choosing another authorized supplier for the permanent service to the completed site.</SPAN></P>

The district attorney decided not to present the case to the grand jury for indictment. The employee instituted civil proceedings asserting claims for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, slander, libel, assault, battery and violations of 42 U.S.C.S &sect;&sect; 1981, 1983 and 1985. The employee dismissed her false imprisonment claim. The employer's motions for directed verdict on the slander, assault, &sect; 1981 and &sect; 1985 claims were granted. A general verdict on the four remaining counts were granted in favor of the employee, as well as attorney fees. The employer appealed, enumerating as error the denial of its motion for directed verdict on the remaining counts. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to grant the employer's motion on the claim of battery as the actions complained of were effected while the officers were discharging their official duties. The employer did not direct the manner in which these duties were performed. The employer was entitled to judgment as to the claim of libel as the remedy for an affidavit for arrest lied in the tort of malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that spousal immunity applied to the action and barred the executrix's suit. The court determined that because the rights of the executrix were derivative of the rights of the husband the executrix had no rights that the husband did not have. The court found that the doctrine of spousal immunity applied because there was no evidence of a lengthy separation or act of violence which clearly evidenced the termination of marital harmony to a degree sufficient to deter any reasonable apprehension of collusion between the spouses.

Defendant appealed from his convictions, alleging that the superior court erred in allowing evidence of the blood alcohol test results over his motion to suppress those results, and that the superior court should have held an evidentiary hearing at the time of the preliminary motion. The court affirmed, holding that there was no requirement that a preliminary hearing be conducted on the motion to suppress because there was an evidentiary predicate to support the ultimate ruling by the superior court, that there was evidence that a paraffin seal was placed into the mouth of the vial containing the blood, and that the seal had a preservative contained within it.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it had no authority under the state constitution to declare a statute unconstitutional, under Ga. Const. Of 1983, art. VI, &sect; VI, par. II(1), but provisions similar to Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding. Defendant asserted that the trial court's charge on the issue of intent was unconstitutionally burden-shifting and therefore violated due process. He further contended that the trial court improperly commented on the evidence in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-57. The court determined that the charge was not violative of due process because the language of the charge was couched in terms of permissible inferences. The jurors were told merely that they were entitled to make certain presumptions or draw certain inferences from the evidence, not that the law required them to do so. The court held that the jury charge did not violate &sect; 17-8-57 because it did not intimate any conclusion on the part of the trial court regarding what the evidence had shown with respect to the alcohol content of defendant's blood at the time of his arrest. The court did not reach the question of whether the charge may have been erroneous for some other reason because no such argument was before the court.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence that he received a stolen car. But the court found that the evidence of defendant's possession of the recently stolen car, coupled with the fact that defendant did not have any papers evidencing ownership of the car or a key to the vehicle, was sufficient to authorize the jury to infer that defendant knew or should have known that the car was stolen. The court also found that evidence showing that he committed a similar transaction was admissible because defendant's motive was a material element to the crime and because defendant had committed the similar transaction after being arrested for the one which he was tried. Therefore, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's convictions for possessing the drugs he claimed to have received pursuant to valid medical prescriptions because he raised an issue as to his authority to possess those substances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board awarded benefits to the claimants. The administrative law judge (ALJ) had found that the employee was murdered by his partner for business reasons. On appeal from a decision affirming the award, the court rejected defendants' contentions that the partner murdered the employee for personal reasons and that the death was thus non-compensable under O.C.G.A. &sect; 34-9-1(4). The evidence did not demand a finding that the murder was perpetrated for non-work related reasons and the record authorized the award. Also, the ALJ did not err in excluding or limiting testimony of witness concerning statements by the partner on the basis that such testimony, according to the ALJ, amounted to little more than gossip. Moreover, the board's award regarding the dependency of the widow was in accord with controlling precedent and was supported by the evidence. Further, the court affirmed the ALJ's finding that the deceased stepchildren were dependents based on the conclusive presumption of dependency under O.C.G.A. &sect; 34-9-13(b) and the widow's testimony. The court declined to apply, retroactively, a statutory amendment limiting the presumption of dependency to dependant stepchildren.</SPAN></P>

The owner sought recovery for damages against the child and against the parents for the child's wilful, wanton, and malicious disregard of others' rights under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-2-3. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of defendants. The court reversed the judgment. First, the court concluded that the jury could have found that the child committed a willful or malicious act, which subjected the parents to the civil, limited liability of &sect; 51-2-3, because the legislation was to provide for the public welfare and aid in controlling juvenile delinquency. Juvenile traffic offenses could have been considered acts of delinquency, and the state considered dangerous, negligent, and incompetent drivers a threat to welfare and safety. As for the child, the &quot;family purpose car doctrine&quot; did not apply between the owner and the child who was not a member of the family. The doctrine only protected children of the owner and was not a device by which the child could have insulated himself from liability to the owner whose son gave him permission to use the car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The group sought to build a health care facility, but the Agency denied the group's application for a certificate of need. Expert analysis of previous decisions of the Agency and Board was not relevant, so it was not error to exclude it. The record did not support an assertion that the Review Board failed to follow its own precedent and failed to explain its departure from precedent. The fact that the Agency granted a certificate of need to another applicant in another place at another time did not show a violation of equal protection because the group was not in the same or similar circumstances as the previous applicant. The Rule for determining hospital bed need, Rule 272-2-.09(8)(a) of the Rules and Regulations of the State Health Planning Agency, was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave notice that the factors listed therein would be considered in the process of determining hospital bed need. A previous action brought by the group against the Agency involved the same issue and concluded with a judgment on the merits, so the group was foreclosed by the doctrine of estoppel by judgment from relitigating the issue.</SPAN></P>

The employee argued that he was entitled to a total exemption on the ground that he had not owed federal tax during the prior year.

It found that under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3402, employers had complete immunity from liability to employees for federal income taxes withheld from their pay. Furthermore, the state court lacked authority to declare any portion of the federal Internal Revenue Code unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended there were a number of disclosures in violation of the wiretapping laws because there was a failure to obtain prior authorization under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq., and 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2517(5) in particular. The court concluded, however, that there was no basis for exclusion of the evidence under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2515, based on circumstances enumerated in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2518(10)(a). Turning to state law, the court also found no violation under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-64(b)(8). The court found no reversible error in the superior court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence from the wiretap or failure to hold a closed hearing. While the court affirmed all of the convictions, it found that one defendant's sentence should be reversed, because evidence of prior charges involving a plea of nolo contendre was improperly admitted at trial, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-2. Therefore, that defendant was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that the statutes were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that the statutes violated the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. When the trial court granted the motion, the State appealed to the supreme court, which transferred the matter to the court; the supreme court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal because the only issue in the case had previously been decided adversely to defendants' contention of unconstitutionality. Upon consideration, the court reversed the judgment. In light of the supreme court's ruling, the court found that there was only one issue remaining: whether the statutes violated the federal constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. The court concluded that the statutes were not violative of defendants' First Amendment rights, citing appellate authority upholding the statutes' constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no evidence to support defendant's assertions that it was &quot;more likely&quot; that any statement he made after indicating that he wanted an attorney was in response to comments made by officers. The court stated that the trial court 's ruling before the jury on the voluntariness of defendant's statement amounted to a violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-8-57 and that in light of the mandatory nature of the statute and precedent, it was necessary to reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offenses for which he was convicted. In addition, the court held that the trial court did not commit error when it required the jury to deliberate for almost ten hours after they had twice informed the trial court that they were deadlocked. Instead, the court held that the trial court properly polled the jurors and that there was no indication that any jurors were so exhausted that they might be forced to vote against their convictions. Thus, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to order a mistrial in lieu of requiring the jury to deliberate further. Lastly, in pertinent part, the court rejected defendant's argument that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-40(b), setting categories for kidnapping, violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the constitutionality of the statute had been upheld and that defendant's argument was therefore meritless.</SPAN></P>

None of the persons objected to by defendant held an elected office. The court also presumed that the grand jury acted according to their oath, presenting no one from envy, hatred, or malice, as public officials were presumed to have performed their duties and acted in good faith. Finally, defendant did not file a timely challenge. Such a motion had to be made prior to the return of the indictment, or defendant had to show that he had no knowledge of an alleged illegal composition of the grand jury prior to the time the indictment was returned. Otherwise, the objection was deemed waived.

On appeal from their convictions, defendants contended, among other things, that the superior court erred in permitting testimony from two state's witnesses whose names had not been provided to defendants before trial pursuant to their request under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-110 and that the superior court should have granted their request for a continuance due to the absence of a witness. The court held, among other things, that there was no error with regard to the witnesses who testified without first being identified to defendants. The superior court provided defendants an opportunity to interview the first witness before he testified. Because the second witness's testimony was cumulative and because defendants were given an opportunity to interview him before he testified, there was no reversible error. Defendants' motion for a continuance was properly denied because the absent witness would have given only cumulative testimony; at least four other witnesses testified that they heard the victim indicate that he did not know who robbed him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Cobb Superior Court (Georgia) judgment on jury conviction for first-degree vehicular homicide, reckless driving, improper passing, and failure to maintain no-fault insurance. He contested several of the charges and evidentiary rulings and the content of the jury charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A fatal collision occurred when defendant passed a slower vehicle on a two-lane hilly and curvy road. Eyewitnesses testified he crossed a double-yellow line into the path of an oncoming vehicle. The other driver was killed and two small children were injured. An accident reconstruction expert testified defendant was going at least 60 miles per hour in the 35-mile-per-hour zone. Defendant argued his convictions for improper passing and reckless driving should have merged into the vehicular homicide. The State agreed, as did the court. It reversed those convictions. There was no other error found. The jury charge issue was waived by defendant's failure to object at trial. Refusal to accept his plea offer did not deny him equal protection or violate statute. His blood and urine samples contained marijuana which could have affected his perceptions while driving. The test results were admissible. A Narcotics Anonymous booklet and disposable syringes, found during an inventory search of his vehicle, were properly admitted into evidence. There was an insufficient showing of a necessity for a continuance during trial when defendant did not appear. Denying him a mistrial was not error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The convictions for improper passing and reckless driving were reversed as they were &quot;lesser included offenses&quot; of vehicular homicide. The vehicular homicide conviction was upheld despite prosecutorial excesses. There was no error or abuse of discretion. The drug-related evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The agency had determined that almost all of the recipient's social security check was to be contributed to the cost of his institutionalization in a nursing home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the recipient's social security income was to be applied first to his own necessary care or whether alimony payments could be paid first. The court, in reversing the trial court's judgment, held that the agency properly refused to exclude the amount for alimony, set in a pre-existing court order, in determining the amount of the recipient's available income for his own medical care. He was entitled to Medicaid (MAO-Medical Assistance Only) because of his nursing home institutionalization, his level of income, and his meeting certain requirements of the supplemental security income program.  42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(V). Alimony required to be paid by a recipient of Medicaid was nowhere excluded. Medicaid was targeted to the individual and would provide medical assistance to the extent that a person's available income could not meet the need. That need came first, in considering the use of social security income. There was no authority for the agency to allow the ex-wife to be paid alimony before determining the amount of the recipient's available income for his needs, so that it could establish Medicaid's share of his nursing home costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had reversed the administrative order determining that almost all of the recipient's social security check was to be contributed to the cost of his institutionalization in a nursing home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had a history of mental conditions. He apparently was often under the misguided belief that people were talking about him. Defendant went into a department store and, with the belief that a salesperson had cheated him, threatened her with a knife. Her manager intervened and the two men struggled. Eventually, defendant was shot in the neck by a police officer. On appeal from his conviction, defendant claimed that the evidence that he was insane at the time of the offenses was so overwhelming that he should have been granted a new trial because the verdict was contrary to the evidence. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. The court noted that the trial judge had not instructed the jury it had to cease deliberation if it found defendant did not have reason to distinguish right and wrong at the time of the act. The trial judge instructed the jury on the insanity defense, and then said: &quot;There is yet another verdict that you may return. And that is guilty but mentally ill.&quot; The court held this error was harmful because it allowed the jury to render a compromise verdict. Such type of verdict was not allowed.</SPAN></P>

He was found guilty of possessing a firearm while a convicted felon. Judgment was entered on the verdict, and he appealed. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence an improperly authenticated document that purported to be a copy of a record of defendant's felony conviction. The document bore a filing stamp showing the federal court in which it was originally filed, and the stamped signature blank, giving the name of the clerk, was signed by a deputy clerk. The court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the document was improperly authenticated. There was no Georgia statute expressly governing the authentication of copies of federal records; however, such documents were admissible if they complied with common-law principles and federal statutory law. The document in question did not meet these requirements. There was no seal, no certificate, no proof of custody of the record, and nothing to show of what court or courts the clerk whose name appeared on the stamp and the signing deputy clerk were officers.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-71.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patients were required to undergo surgery for abscesses on their hips from the alleged negligence of the physician's nurse in giving them each an injection. More then two years later, the patents filed a malpractice action against the physician. The physician filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The trial court found that the patients should have known of the allegedly negligent treatment when their hips first became sore. Also, they had not shown any fraud within the meaning of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-96 so as to toll the two-year statute of limitation under &sect; 9-3-71. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 9-3-71 barred the patents' action. Defining the &quot;injuries&quot; as the abscesses that developed on the patients' hips, such injuries occurred within weeks of the injections. Thus, the statute of limitation began to run on the date of the injections. Also, the statute of limitations was not tolled by reason of fraud. Because the physician's nurse had given the injections, there was absolutely no basis for inferring that the physician had any knowledge of improper conduct on his part or that he tried to cover up such conduct in any way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant employee was a construction superintendent for defendant employer and was furnished a truck for his employer's use and for his own use. The deceased was working, and while returning home after leaving his job site, the employee drove his truck into a cable jerking the deceased to the ground. The deceased died as a result of injuries he received from the fall. Plaintiff widow, who brought the action for his wrongful death, their daughter, and two sons of his prior marriage, survived the deceased. The employer moved for summary judgment on the issue of respondeat superior and both defendants moved to dismiss for failure to join indispensable parties, the three minor children of the deceased. The trial court denied the employer's motion for summary judgment and, having concluded that the children were necessary parties, ordered the widow to bring them into the action or obtain their disclaimer. The court found that because the effect of a withdrawn admission was for the jury, it was not error to deny summary judgment. Further, the decision requiring that the children be made parties to the suit was in error because they would share in any judgment awarding compensation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also rubbed the girls' legs while they sat on his bed. Defendant also showed the girls a condom and described how it worked while he had an erection. On appeal from his conviction for child molestation, defendant alleged, inter alia, that his demurrers to the indictment were improperly denied because the indictment did not charge a crime under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-4, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that &sect; 16-6-4 was unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that defendant's demurrers to the indictment were properly denied, as the child molestation counts alleged acts that were immoral and indecent and were done with the intent to arose or satisfy the sexual desires of the children or himself. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction, as defendant's pattern of conduct with the girls did not conform to generally accepted standards of morality. Finally, the question as to whether &sect; 16-6-4 was vague had previously been settled by other courts of the state.</SPAN></P>

After rejecting the contention that the patient had remained under the doctors' care following actual medical treatment and diagnosis, the court also held the statute of limitations had not been tolled by fraud because the allegations of negligent treatment and advice, misdiagnosis, and wrong opinion had constituted negligence, not fraud.

Because defendants' Brady motions did not refer to discovery of scientific reports pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-211, and did not make clear that the 10-day time frame was being invoked, their Brady motions were not sufficient to constitute a request for discovery under the provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-211. The trial court's jury instruction on intent created a permissive inference rather than a mandatory presumption and did not otherwise shift the burden of persuasion to the defense.

The court reasoned that the blood was validly taken because defendant consented. Also, defendant was under arrest because she was not free to leave the hospital. There was probable cause to arrest her given her condition and the position of her car. The jury instructions were proper because the jury was advised that the presumptions under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-392 were rebuttable, and, thus, the burden of proof was not shifted to defendant.

The trial court did not err in instructing the jury that the law would not enforce a contract founded on an immoral consideration such as unmarried cohabitation. The charge was authorized under the evidence.  Ga.

The court could not say that the evidence did not authorize the jury to find that the parties' specific agreement regarding living expenses to be incurred in connection with their state of unmarried meretricious cohabitation was founded upon or grew immediately out of immorality or illegality within the meaning of &sect; 13-8-1.</SPAN></P>

The insured contended that the insurer's offer of optional coverage failed to meet the statutory requirements and that the insured's written rejection of additional coverage was insufficient as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured was seriously injured in an automobile accident, and the insurer paid the insured the basic personal injury protection (PIP) benefits under an automobile policy. The insured sought an additional $ 45,000 in optional PIP benefits, and the insured initiated the lawsuit after the insurer refused to pay the additional benefits. The record showed that six years before the accident, the insured had rejected the insurer's offer to purchase the additional coverage by checking an &quot;X&quot; in a box designating a rejection of such coverage. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the insurer and concluded that the insurer's offer of optional PIP coverages met all the statutory requirements and that the insured's written rejection of the additional coverage was sufficient as a matter of law. The court ruled that the insurer's offer was not required to specify the date upon which the higher coverage would become effective unless rejected. The court concluded that the insurer's offer of optional coverage was not unconstitutionally discriminatory simply because it stated that the additional coverage would be added automatically unless rejected by the insured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county enacted an ordinance that imposed a license tax on insurance companies and levied a tax upon the gross premium receipts of all insurance companies doing business in the county. A few years later the state legislature amended the state's insurance code to expressly preempt the field of imposing taxes upon insurance companies. Shortly thereafter, a judicial decision was rendered which declared the county ordinance unauthorized and void. The insurance company then filed suit for a refund of the gross premium taxes it had paid. The trial court granted the county's motion for summary judgment, and the insurance company appealed. The court affirmed. The court agreed with the trial court that the judicial decision had prospective application only. The decision did not apply retroactively because the inequity that would result from retroactive application was far greater than that suffered by the insurance company if retroactive application was not granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A blood test showed that defendant's blood-alcohol content was 0.23 percent. Defendant was subsequently convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and improper driving on roadway. Defendant argued on appeal that the jury instructions regarding presumptions improperly shifted the burden of proof. The court affirmed the conviction. The court first noted that the indictment against defendant was duplicitous because it joined the two distinct crimes of driving under the influence of alcohol under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(1) and driving with more than 0.12 percent alcohol in his blood under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(4). Nonetheless, the court held that defendant waived any challenge to the indictment. The court then held that the jury instruction that &quot;it shall be presumed&quot; that defendant was under the influence of alcohol if there was more than 0.10 percent alcohol in his blood did likely shift the burden of proof, but that such instruction was not reversal error. The court noted that because defendant was also charged with violating &sect; 40-6-391(a)(4), which stated that driving with 0.12 percent alcohol was a crime, a conclusive presumption was established.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the trial court's charge on presumptions in general and the presumptions relating to levels of intoxication, as delineated in O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-392(b), shifted the burden of proof to him. The court affirmed, first concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance. The court noted that counsel did not contend that he had insufficient time to prepare for trial because of the jury duty and that it was clear from the transcripts that counsel was prepared. The court also found that no reasonable juror could have interpreted the trial court's charge as having shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The court noted that the trial court charged the jury that it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove all of the elements of the charged offense, that defendant was presumed to be innocent, and that defendant bore no burden whatsoever to introduce evidence in support of his innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A mother challenged a juvenile court's decision which awarded permanent custody of a minor child to the father. The mother contended the juvenile court was without jurisdiction over the issue of child custody and argued the superior, which granted the final decree of divorce, had exclusive jurisdiction over the issue of custody. The court affirmed the juvenile and superior courts' judgment awarding permanent custody of the minor child to the father and affirmed the decision denying the mother's motions for a new trial. The court held that although the superior court was vested with exclusive jurisdiction in divorce cases, the Georgia Supreme Court had held that this did not involve determination of custody of minor children. As such, the superior court had the power to transfer the issue of child custody to the juvenile court for investigation and determination. The court held the order granting the parties a divorce was not res judicata on the issue of permanent custody of the child since the issue of permanent custody had never been determined and was properly transferred to juvenile court. Finally, the court held the juvenile court's findings were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

The chance viewing of defendant in the company of several other prisoners by the victim of the purse snatching at an arraignment hearing one week after defendant's arrest was not unduly suggestive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant recipient sought review of an order of the Calhoun Superior Court (Georgia), which entered judgment in favor of appellee state department of human resources (DHR). The DHR brought the action in the name of the recipient's minor child under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-11-7 (a) of the Child Support Recovery Act to recover Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) funds paid to the recipient on behalf of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The recipient was disqualified for public assistance from DHR upon her receipt of a lump sum payment of life insurance proceeds. The trial court held that she was liable for the repayment under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-11-5 and that the DHR had complied with due process. On appeal, the recipient contended that the absent noncustodial parent owed the debt and that she had no notice of such liability. The court disagreed and affirmed. Because the recipient was obligated by law to support her minor child, any public assistance provided to her for that support created a debt to the state by her, in the absence of a court order or agreement to the contrary. The court rejected the recipient's assertion that she was entitled, prior to the initiation of the lawsuit, to notice of DHR's claim against her for recovery of the AFDC benefits and an opportunity to be heard. The recipient had notice of her own receipt of benefits and there was no indication under &sect; 19-11-5 that the debt was exclusively that of an absent noncustodial parent. Also, the amount of the debt did not depend on her financial status and ability to repay or on her service as her child's primary caretaker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the DHR and against the recipient in the DHR's action for reimbursement from the recipient of Aid to Families with Dependent Children funds paid to her on behalf of her child.</SPAN></P>

The witness found the victim in the bed, with bare shoulders, and the bedding pulled around her body. Defendant argued that the statement of the victim was neither sufficiently supported, nor corroborated by the testimony of the other witnesses. On appeal, the court held that the evidence presented by the State adequately corroborated the testimony of the victim and was sufficient for any rational trier of fact to have found the existence of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err in not granting a mistrial on the ground that defendant had represented himself. The record showed with convincing clarity that defendant knowingly, understandingly, and voluntarily waived the right of representation by counsel. Because defendant appeared pro se, he could not thereafter be heard to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when he was the acting counsel at the time of the alleged error. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in not affording defendant an in camera hearing.</SPAN></P>

Several years later, he had a human leukocyte antigen test performed that showed him not to be the father of the child. Defendant then brought an extraordinary motion for a new trial, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that defendant's extraordinary motion for new trial was the proper procedural vehicle by which to challenge his guilty plea on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The court also held that defendant had used the diligence of an ordinary man under the circumstances because he did not have money to pay for the blood test at the time of his trial, as was required by statute. When he finally did save the money, the state supreme court had held that requiring indigent putative fathers to pay for their own paternity test in abandonment proceedings was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The dog had no identification or vaccination tags enabling the society to find the owner. He appealed on the premise that the dog was personal property, the &quot;title&quot; to which was vested in him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Nine days after the humane society received the owner's dog, it was placed for &quot;adoption.&quot; After it had been adopted, the owner learned from the pound that a dog similar to the one he lost had been in its possession but had been adopted. He sued to recover the dog or its value and to force the society to release the identity of the adopter so he could negotiate its return or recover its value. The trial court granted the humane society summary judgment and denied discovery of the identity of the adopter based on public policy. The case was transferred to the state supreme court because of the asserted unconstitutionality of the relevant county ordinance. The supreme court refused to review the constitutional challenge, mandating the finding that those contentions of error were meritless. The ordinance did not speak of &quot;owners&quot; of animals or transfer of &quot;title&quot; to impounded animals. The ordinance authorized &quot;adoption&quot; of a dog if the person with right to possession had not claimed it. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the owner's possessory interest did not transcend that of the state's police power to regulate keeping of dogs.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the trial court's reference to the appellate courts' curative powers was not reversible error as it was a part of juror orientation to the judicial system and did not intimate any opinion of the trial judge regarding the instant case. Because the remark regarding the constitutionality of the rape statute was made before voir dire and counsel had the opportunity to examine prospective jurors regarding any prejudicial effect, the court found no error in the denial of a motion for mistrial. The court held that the prosecutor was permitted to argue in his closing certain inferences to be drawn from the second defendant's failure to call a witness, who allegedly could support his alibi.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the mutiny convictions were affirmed and the assault convictions were vacated. The court held that a comparison of the elements of mutiny under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-54 and aggravated assault under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-21 revealed that a conviction for mutiny required proof of one element that was not necessary for the aggravated assault conviction. That is proof that the perpetrator was a person in the lawful custody of a penal institution. Therefore, under the statutory definition of included offense, the aggravated assault upon a peace officer merged into the mutiny conviction because the aggravated assault charge was established by proof of less than all the facts required to establish the commission of mutiny pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-1-6. Thus, the facts adduced to support the aggravated assault charge, as it was set forth in the indictment, were the same facts used to support the mutiny charge, as it was set forth in the indictment. Therefore, the aggravated assault charge was an offense included within the mutiny charge pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-1-6(a) and was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant allegedly breached his lease agreement with the landlord when he attempted to assign his rights to a third party without the landlord's express, written approval.

The tenant failed to answer within the seven days prescribed in &sect; 44-7-51(b). Although the trial court entered a default judgment against the tenant, it granted the tenant's motion to reopen the action. In his interlocutory appeal, the landlord argued that the lower court erred in granting the tenant's motion to open the default because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 44-7-53(a) did not provide for such an action. The tenant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. The court reversed and denied the tenant's motion to dismiss the appeal. The court held that the trial court had no authority to grant the tenant's motion to open the default under &sect; 44-7-53(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion in autrefois convict. The basis of the motion was defendant's purported conviction of two traffic offenses, following too close and driving without insurance, in the recorder's court. Defendant argued that because the subject offenses arose out of the same conduct as the offenses tried in recorder's court, the subsequent prosecution of the subject offenses in superior court was barred by O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-1-7 (b). On appeal, the court held that &sect; 16-1-7(b) did not preclude successive state and municipal prosecutions, only successive prosecutions for state crimes. Thus, defendant's conviction for following too close, based upon violation of a local ordinance, did not bar the later prosecution from which defendant brought the appeal. The court was persuaded that the recorder's court lacked jurisdiction to try defendant for driving without insurance, a violation of state law. Since the recorder's court lacked jurisdiction to try defendant for violation of a state law, &sect; 16-1-7 (b) provided no bar to defendant's subsequent prosecution in superior court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant also argued that reversible error occurred when the trial judge failed to recuse himself in light of the prosecutor's alleged prejudicial closing remarks regarding defendant's suspected other criminal conduct not in evidence. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. The evidence established that while fleeing from approaching police officers, defendant tossed a bag that was ultimately found to contain cocaine. That evidence satisfied the slight evidentiary standard necessary to support a finding that defendant violated the probation condition precluding him from engaging in unlawful conduct. Likewise, there was no merit to defendant's claim regarding the trial judge's failure to recuse himself because defendant made no motion for recusal or for a mistrial, and because after his objection to the remarks was sustained the trial judge reprimanded the prosecutor immediately, harshly, and repeatedly. Moreover, there was no great probability that the improper remarks contributed to the ruling setting aside defendant's probation and adjudicating him guilty. Finally, defendant's sentence was not excessive because it was within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended, primarily, that the statute on driving under the influence of alcohol was unconstitutional or unconstitutionally applied to him and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for public indecency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer observed defendant urinating behind a car in a parking lot. After defendant drove out of the lot, the police officer stopped defendant to arrest him for public indecency but subsequently charged defendant, in addition, with driving under the influence of alcohol. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the presumption of intoxication in O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6- 392(b)(3) did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant. Further, the trial court properly instructed the jury that this presumption was rebuttable. With regard to the public indecency charge, the court found that the evidence supported the jury's conclusion that defendant's act of public urination was far enough removed from community morality norms to be considered lewd. In addition, the jury could readily have determined that the parking lot was a public place under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-1-3(15). Finally, the court concluded that, regardless of an alleged variance between the evidence offered by the State at defendant's trial and the accusations against him, defendant was able to present his defense to the charges and was not surprised by the evidence introduced at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and the victim were acquainted, and while defendant and co-defendant were visiting the victim in her home, she resisted defendant's sexual advances. Defendant and co-defendant left but returned later when defendant broke into the home through a window and then opened the door for co-defendant. Both men forced the victim to have sexual intercourse, and the victim saw each man remove property from her home, such as money and stereo speakers. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that: (1) the State's failure to request a separate trial on the rape charge against defendant following his guilty plea to burglary did not bar his prosecution for rape because the two crimes were separate and distinct. Thus, defendant's motion of autrefois convict was properly denied. (2) When prosecuting defendant for rape, evidence showing that he also committed burglary was admissible as part of the res gestae of the rape; (3) defendant's confession to the burglary was admissible against co-defendant; and (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not permitting co-defendant to ask the victim about past events that had made her so nervous and agitated that she needed medication.</SPAN></P>

The trial court terminated the parents' parental rights.

The parents appealed. The court vacated the trial court's decision and remanded the matter for reconsideration. The court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that the parents could not care for the child. However, the court stated that it had doubts as to whether the complete severance of parental rights was the appropriate remedy, especially in light of the fact that the department intended to adopt the child out to relatives and allow him to have contact with his parents. Finally, the court held that the trial court had not erred in allowing the parents' pastor and his wife to testify as to their observations of the child because such testimony did not stem from privileged communications arising from spiritual counseling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the indictment and the evidence on which he was convicted did not constitute the crime of sodomy under the law. The indictment accused defendant of aggravated sodomy with force and against the will of the male victim by placing his mouth on the sex organ of the victim. Defendant argued that because the word &quot;another&quot; in &sect; 16-6-2 was defined by O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-1-3 as &quot;a person other than the accused,&quot; he did not commit sodomy by placing his mouth on the victim's sex organ because O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-2 only proscribed the placing of the accused's sex organ in the mouth or anus of another. The court rejected defendant's argument, holding that prior to recodification, sodomy was a crime if the accused placed his mouth on the sex organ of the victim, and that under O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-1-2, it was clear that the Georgia General Assembly did not intend to change the sodomy statute to exclude as a crime the placing of one's mouth on the sexual organ of another. Thus, the court held that it was clear that the term &quot;another&quot; in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-2 included the accused person.</SPAN></P>

The court had no jurisdiction to review the denial of appellant's motion to suppress by the criminal trial court. The condemnation court had in personam jurisdiction because appellant was personally served by a duly appointed deputy sheriff. Moreover, a condemnation forfeiture was an in rem proceeding, and it was jurisdiction over the property that was essential. Jurisdiction of the property indisputably existed. The constitutionality of &sect; 16-13-40 had been upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer observed defendant selling heroin from a cache behind a tree, and when he was arrested he admitted the drugs were his and that he was a junkie. The trial court convicted defendant of possession with intent to distribute, and the court affirmed, finding the evidence more than sufficient to enable any rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty as charged. In addition, it was not error for the trial court to admit evidence of defendant's involvement in previous drug transactions that had occurred almost three years prior to the instant offense. The crimes were similar in that they both involved the sale of heroin in small, clear packets, and other details were similar. Thus, the other crimes were admissible to prove identity, motive, plan, scheme, bent of mind, or course of conduct. Further, the trial court properly charged the jury that defendant had the burden of showing that he had the authority to carry the heroin. Since the State established a prima facie case of possession, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-4-3 the burden shifted to defendant to show that it was authorized. Last, the trial court properly denied the appeal bond.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the sentence that resulted from his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while his license was revoked, pursuant to a previous declaration that he was an habitual violator under O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-308, from the Superior Court of Dougherty County (Georgia).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his sentence of five years confinement under O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-58(c) (1981) was excessive because his previous declaration as an habitual offender was not pursuant to that statute but was pursuant to former O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-308(a). Based on this reasoning, defendant argued that he could only be punished for driving while his license was revoked as provided for in O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-121, which authorized a maximum sentence of six months. The court disagreed and found that it was first required to ascertain the legislative intent in enacting the 1981 law and then give it that construction that would effectuate the legislative intent and purpose. When the legislature enacted the 1981 code, it specifically set forth its legislative intent not to alter the substantive law in existence unless specifically provided by provisions of the code. The court compared O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-308 with O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-58 and held that the latter was nothing more than a reenactment of the former and that defendant's license revocation was effected &quot;under this Code section&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 40-5-58(c).</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the search of defendant did not fall within either of the justifications set forth in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-5-28.

The award was premised upon the finding that because the common law marriage created between the deceased and his first wife was never dissolved by divorce, all subsequent marriages entered into by the deceased were not valid. On appeal, the superior court found that there was no evidence to support the finding of the existence of a common law marriage between the deceased and his first wife. The county appealed from the order of the superior court. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of a common law marriage. The court stated that Ga.

It was upon the basis of defendant's speed, an odor of alcohol, and defendant's alcohol level that he was charged with DUI. The officer detected no erratic driving or aberrational physical conduct. The trial court charged upon the legal presumption arising from the .11 breathalyzer reading. The court found no merit in the argument that the charge of the trial court shifted the burden to defendant. Defendant offered evidence that he had consumed a minimal amount of beer over a sustained period, exercised vigorously, eaten a meal, and both his wife and the officer indicated he appeared &quot;normal.&quot; In accordance with the charge of the court, the &quot;presumption&quot; raised by the .11 reading &quot;disappeared&quot; in the face of this contradictory evidence, and the jury was required to determine the issue of driving while intoxicated based upon the &quot;usual rules of evidence.&quot; The court was satisfied that the charge on the &quot;presumption&quot; authorized by a breathalyzer reading of more than .10 alcohol in the blood created merely a &quot;permissive presumption,&quot; and did not place any kind of burden upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In Georgia, the bank received the default judgment against the employee to recover a debt. The employee lived in Georgia and worked at the employer's plant in South Carolina. The bank obtained the continuing writ of garnishment in Georgia against the employer's registered agent in South Carolina. The employer's answer admitted that wages were due under the garnishment, but denied owing payment because this was a Georgia garnishment action and the extension of garnishment power to South Carolina assets violated due process. The court affirmed the partial summary judgment rendered for the bank allowing the Georgia garnishment to attach wages paid in South Carolina but declining to award the entire debt. The court held that the employer confessed personal jurisdiction because of its lack of objection. The court ruled that it was irrelevant that the principal debtor and garnishee were both non-residents, or that the debt was owed in another state. The court found no error under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-4-113, in terms of the partial summary judgment's limitation of the amount that the bank could recover. The court found that the employer limited the amount of debt owed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was not error for the trial court to apply the guilty but mentally ill standard to defendant retrospectively because it was procedural and not substantive.

Two of the defendants challenged the judgment, claiming error in the assessment of restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The vandalism which defendants pleaded guilty to took place at a county sewage disposal plant. While defendants admitted damaging the plant's electrical panel, water cooler and overhead heater, they also intimated that other individuals played a role in damaging the plant. Defendants also challenged the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2711, which authorized restitution as part of a criminal sentence. On appeal, the court rejected the attack upon &sect; 27-2711, declaring that because defendants failed to raise any challenge thereto in the trial court, the issue was not reviewable. Also, given the extensive evidence presented at the trial court's hearing on the damage to the plant, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the amount of restitution fixed by the trial court. Noting that the only evidence that anyone aside from defendants had damaged the plant came from defendants' testimony, the court stressed the trial court's role in determining the credibility of witnesses. Moreover, because the factual findings of the trial court were not clearly erroneous, they could not be disturbed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendants mounted a two-fold attack upon the restitution assessed against them by the trial court, arguing on the one hand that the statute governing restitution, O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2711, was unconstitutional, and on the other hand that the trial court failed to formally reach an adjudication as to restitution because &sect; 27-2711 did not delineate the form or content of such an adjudication. The court rejected the constitutional challenge to the statute, ruling that because the issue was not raised by defendants at the trial court, it was not reviewable. As to the other challenge, the court ruled that given the two-day hearing held by the trial court, at which testimony was given by an engineer for the sewage disposal plant regarding the damage caused by the vandalism and the costs of repairing same, the court ruled that a formal adjudication had been reached. In so ruling, the court noted that the only evidence that anyone other than defendants had damaged the plant came from defendants' testimony, the credibility of which was to be judged by the trial court.

The court found that the delivery of the drug used during the patient's diagnostic procedure was encompassed within an action for medical malpractice and, thus, was barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants committed the crime of burglary while former O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-8-60 was in effect.

The trial court refused to allow defendants to withdraw their guilty plea. The court held that the sentences were void. The Act did not apply to defendants because it was not in effect at the time defendants committed the burglary. To apply the Act to them would have violated U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, two podiatrists, appealed the order of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants, a hospital, the various directors and officers of the hospital corporations and the administrator of the hospital, in a case over the termination of plaintiffs' hospital privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were podiatrists who had privileges at defendant hospital. The hospital adopted new bylaws allowing only doctors eligible for membership in the American Medical Association (AMA) to practice or be appointed to the medical staff. Plaintiffs were not reappointed to the staff, as podiatrists are not eligible for membership in the AMA. Plaintiffs sued defendants, the hospital, the administrator, various directors, and officers. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment and plaintiffs appealed. The court found that defendants' actions did not constitute &quot;state action&quot; to deprive the plaintiffs of constitutionally protected rights; did not amount to acts in concert to breach the defendant hospital's contractual obligations to plaintiffs; and did not amount to an action of conspiracy in restraint of trade and tortious interference with the lawful business of the plaintiffs. Therefore the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The summary judgment in favor of defendants was affirmed because the actions of the defendants did not constitute &quot;state action&quot; for constitutional purposes, and as no state action existed there could be no violation of Georgia law involving the criminal statute; no contract existed between the plaintiffs and the defendants which had been breached by defendants.</SPAN></P>

The trial court struck the award of punitive damages to the debtor because no actual damages were awarded. The court allowed the remainder of the verdict to stand in favor of the creditor and issued a judgment in creditor's favor. The debtor's motion for new trial was denied. On appeal, the debtor claimed that the trial court erred in failing to resubmit the case to the jury if the court was of the impression that a verdict only for punitive damages was illegal. The court affirmed and found that no abuse of discretion had been shown. There was no requirement for the trial court to offer to further instruct the jury and resubmit the case with reference to the award of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

The first defendant was arrested in one motel room where officers seized a pound of cocaine. The other defendants were arrested in a second motel room, where scrapings and residue of cocaine was found in a toilet and a plastic bag. The court held that: (1) defendants did not demonstrate any prejudice in the trial court's denial of their motions to sever; and (2) a proper foundation was laid for the admission of a tape recording because police officers testified concerning the condition of the recorder, the operator's competency, the authenticity of the recording, that the recording was not altered, that police officer had custody of the recording, identification of the speakers, and that there was nothing that indicated that the statements were not voluntary and of defendants' own choosing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in overruling the motion to suppress the evidence on the basis that the evidence before the justice of the peace who issued the search warrant contained hearsay upon hearsay upon hearsay because an informant spoke to a sheriff, who conveyed the information to a lieutenant, who in turn conveyed it to the investigator who made the affidavit and obtained the warrant.

The benefits ceased when the employee was determined no longer disabled under Tennessee law. He then applied for and received benefits from the Georgia State Board of Workers' Compensation (board).  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 114-411 allowed the state to award benefits after another state had awarded benefits, as long as the total award did not exceed that allowed under the Georgia Workers' Compensation Act (Act). The court held that Act applied when jurisdiction was invoked under &sect; 114-411. Conflicts of law rules did not obligate the board and state courts to apply any other law besides the Act in proceedings under &sect; 114-411. The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution did not require that Georgia adhere to Tennessee's ruling that the employee was no longer entitled to benefits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The doctor left a suture in the patient's ureter leading to her left kidney during a hysterectomy. The suture blocked the kidney, necessitating its removal.

After the trial court granted defendant doctor's motion for summary judgment based upon the running of a statute of limitation under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1102, the patient and the spouse appealed. The court reversed. The grant of summary judgment based on the statute of limitation was error. The 1980 operation to remove the kidney was the date on which the discovery occurred. The suits were filed in 1981 and were within a one-year statute of limitation under &sect; 3-1103. The doctor gave no evidence that the suture was the result of proper medical procedure. Therefore, the suture was a &quot;foreign object&quot; under &sect; 3-1103.

The condemnee's land was adjacent to a high school. The proposed use of the condemnee's property was to construct an athletic track. The order of the trial court denying the condemnee's motion to dismiss was certified for immediate review. The threshold issue was whether the condemnor, a county board of education, was authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain pursuant to the Special Master Act (Act), Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-601a et seq. (1956). The court held that a county board of education could use the &quot;supplementary&quot; and &quot;cumulative&quot; special master form of condemnation procedure pursuant to the Act, Ga. Code ann. &sect; 36-602a. Thus, the trial court did not err in holding that the condemnor was authorized. However, there was no express authority for the condemnor to exercise its power of eminent domain outside the limits of its territory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow claimed that the doctor misread an X-ray that her husband had received and did not alert the husband to an abdominal aortal aneurysm. The aneurysm ruptured, and the husband died. The widow filed an action against the doctor, alleging wrongful death and pain and suffering. The trial court granted the doctor summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. The court reversed, finding that the widow had timely filed her complaint. The Supreme Court of Georgia rendered a decision in another case that expressly repudiated the court's reasoning. The court held that the trial court did not err in granting the doctor summary judgment based upon the running of the statute of limitations. The court made an erroneous interpretation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1105 (1976), applying its one-year grace period to a repealed portion of a statute rather than to the time allowed the widow to file a complaint arising out of an injury. While the widow's case was still pending trial, the Supreme Court repudiated the court's reasoning. That destroyed the basis for the court's holding and overruled that case. The Supreme Court's pronouncement became the law of the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined the sale temporarily but the taxpayer did not pay the taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was ordered transferred to the Supreme Court of Georgia and it held that the injunction and declaratory provisions of the case were moot when the taxpayer failed to pay the taxes and the property was sold at a tax sale. The only action that remained was a claim for money judgment and the appeal from that action was within the jurisdiction of the court. On appeal, the court affirmed. The taxpayer failed to submit any evidence of accompanying personal or property damage for which defendants were responsible and the directed verdict on the issue of damages as well as the denial of the motion for a new trial were properly issued. The opening of the default was within the discretion of the trial court. The trial court did not err in upholding as irrelevant defendants' objection to a witness's testimony as to statements that he made on the radio that showed a motivation for discrimination against the taxpayer because he belonged to a citizens tax group. The taxpayer was not entitled to actual damages for time lost in preparing for the litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant first alleged that O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2511 was unconstitutional because it diminished the powers and authority of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. In affirming the judgment, the court ruled that defendant did not have standing to contest the code section because he had not claimed a right of parole to which the statute had been asserted against him as a bar. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a continuance due to his recovery from hepatitis because there was no medical evidence offered to support defendant's claim that the disease prevented him from adequately preparing for his trial. Defendant failed to show any harmful error. Finally, the court found that the State showed with a reasonable certainty that the evidence admitted at trial was the same as that seized and that there had been no tampering or substitution either before it was analyzed or afterwards. Where there was only mere speculation of tampering, the evidence could be admitted, and any doubt went to its weight.</SPAN></P>

They claimed that it was error to deny motions to dismiss and motions to suppress based on illegalities in police methods, to fail to give instruction on lesser included offenses, and to amend a sentence after one defendant had already started serving it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were arrested at an airport after arriving there on a small airplane; the airplane was seized along with a large amount of marijuana and cash. They claimed that the police used subpoenas issued in false names and intimidating language to induce witnesses into silence, that some false statements were used in an affidavit in support of a petition for a wiretap, and that a district attorney's office may have been involved. On review, the court found that although reprehensible, such misconduct did not require reversal because there was sufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that the arrests and seizures resulted from independent sources. The court ruled that evidence of less than an ounce of marijuana seeds swept from the airplane did not warrant a jury charge on lesser included offenses because the evidence was submitted solely for the purpose of linking defendants to the large amount of marijuana found on the runway. The court found that it was error for the trial judge to modify the terms of one defendant's probation dependent upon payment of a fine after the judge had signed the sentence, and ruled that forfeiture of the airplane was allows under O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-828.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that &sect; 68B-308(c), was not a recidivist statute. Hence, under &sect; 68B-308(c), the State was not required to prove defendant's prior conviction. The State was required to show that defendant was given notice of revocation of his driver's license because of his having been declared a habitual offender.

The court held that the officer's testimony was substantial evidence that could be used against defendant with reference to the charge of possession of drugs. The officers were in the course of a legal investigation, and defendant was eventually arrested and charged with the drugs found during their search. The testimony was relevant to show that defendant could have been or was in fact maintaining direct contact with the residence being searched and with the controlled substances found at the residence.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court first found that the trial court was entitled to consider the prior convictions, even though defendant was not represented by counsel, because defendant did not receive any time to serve as a result of her guilty pleas. The court then found that defendant's prior convictions were not considered to enhance her sentence to a mandatory sentence of imprisonment or to impose an increased term of imprisonment. The sentence given defendant did not exceed that which could have been imposed upon a first-time misdemeanor offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The newly appraised residential areas were less than 50 percent of the county's geographical jurisdiction or of the city residential property, and there was no plan to reappraise the other city property. The landowners successfully contended that the reassessment was unconstitutional because it imposed new valuations upon their property without reassessing all county taxpayers' properties. On appeal, the assessors claimed that the trial court's judgment should be set aside because the trial court's process was inconsistent with 1974 Ga. Laws 3607-3609, which affected assessors in counties over a designated population. The court held that the assessors' argument lacked merit and it agreed with the landowners in concluding that piecemeal reappraisals that resulted in significant tax increases without regard to any equalization between the taxpayers were contrary to O.C.G.A. &sect; 91A-1448 and that such reappraisals were void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child's parents refused to give permission for the child to get a needed operation. The department filed a petition alleging that the child was a deprived child and sought to be named the child's temporary guardian so he could get the necessary medical care. The juvenile court dismissed the petition for lack of venue because the parents and child all resided in a different county from the one in which the case brought. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that a state constitutional right allowing parents to defend a termination-of-parental-rights suit in their county of residence did not apply to the instant case because it involved a temporary change in the legal custody of the child pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24A-2301 and did not involve the termination of parental rights pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24A-32. Application of the requirement that the case be brought in the parent's county of residence would also have thwarted the legislative policy of making the best interests of the child the paramount consideration. Because the deprivation petition was brought in a county where the child was physically present, venue was proper.</SPAN></P>

A jury found him to be the natural father of the child, but not guilty of abandonment. Defendant appealed and claimed that &sect; 74-9902(h) was unconstitutional because it placed the financial burden on him to pay for the blood tests and did not allow indigency to obviate the financial burden. The State filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. The court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal. Because defendant had been acquitted of abandonment, there was nothing for the court to review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court determined that the insurer's counterclaims were not barred by the statute of limitations, the insurer had a right of subrogation, the applicable statute of limitations for personal injuries was two years, and Ga.

The trial court found in favor of the bank. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court refused to hold as a matter of law that a 12-year-old was not &quot;a person of suitable age and discretion.&quot; The presumption of valid service stood unless rebutted by the debtors. The fact that the debtors received the service was some indication that that person was of suitable age and discretion. Service of process was not invalid due solely to the fact that it was made on Sunday. If the items added to the truck did make it more valuable, the increased value would be reflected in the amount received for the truck at the public auction. That amount was offset against the balance of the note as required by law.

The Georgia Supreme Court transferred the case to the court after deciding the enumeration adversely to defendant and determining that it had decided the only constitutional question within its jurisdiction. The court found no merit to defendant's second enumeration of error that the trial court's charge on constructive knowledge violated constitutional requirements of scienter because the charge was given in the exact language of &sect; 26-2101 and did not place a greater burden on defendant than &quot;knowledge of the contents of the materials he distributed.&quot; Affirming, the court held that the remaining enumeration complaining of not being allowed access to statements from which a prosecution witness refreshed his recollection was meritless because defendant had no right to examine such statements.</SPAN></P>

The garnishee had no authority, however, to waive the judgment debtor's statutory exemptions from garnishment. In the instant action, the garnishee did not fail to claim any applicable exemptions because none existed with respect to a garnishment for alimony and child support.

The court rejected claims of error concerning the search warrant description and the witness identification procedure, however, finding that the process used by police was appropriate because defendant shaved off the mustache he had at the time of the offense and at booking prior to the lineup.

Defendant argued the statute was unconstitutional and alleged various trial errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testimony of a bank witness showed how the notations on the checks had been made in the regular course of business pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-711. The court first found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1704 did not authorize imprisonment for debts, and thus, it was constitutional. Defendant contended the trial court erred in allowing an employee of the bank to testify as to the meaning of the notations &quot;insufficient funds&quot; and &quot;account closed.&quot; Because the checks were admitted into evidence without objection, the contents of the checks were not at issue, and the best evidence rule did not apply. The notations were primary evidence, establishing, prima facie, the facts stated. The witness's testimony was simply an explication of the bank's entries, and any error was harmless. Although notice had been sent to defendant at an address other than the one on the check, as required under O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1704(a)(2)(A), the notice provision was held to be evidentiary and not a prerequisite to a conviction. The trial court could be convinced by other evidence as to defendant's mens rea, and writing the checks on a closed account was prima facie evidence that defendant knew they would not be honored.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no decision interpreting O.C.G.A. &sect; 74-104.1 in a criminal matter. In affirming, the court held that there was no magic in the age 21. The court held that the sentencing court's intent was to provide support until the last child reached the age of majority. The court held that &sect; 74-104.1 applied to civil matters because it was devoid of any reference to court orders arising out of criminal prosecutions for child abandonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Several days after a final order, the trial court vacated the order granting defendant's motions to suppress after a full, complete hearing, and allowed the state introduce more evidence at another hearing, ultimately resulting in a new order that denied the motions to suppress. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the reconsideration of a suppression order had not been presented directly to the appellate courts of the state. The federal procedure was convincing, so the court adopted the federal procedure. The state courts could set aside their own orders ex mero motu and to do so was within the sound discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the guarantor's motion for partial summary judgment and granted the creditor's motion for summary judgment. The guarantor sought review, and the court affirmed. The trial court could grant summary judgment after a reversal of a previous order granting a motion for directed verdict. The court examined the creditor's contentions as to the establishment of the amount due on account and under each of the guaranties separately, then examined each of the defenses interposed by the guarantor and debtor and found no new evidence in the record that would require a different result from that obtained before the court of appeals. Where there was no evidence to controvert the creditor's assertion regarding the total debt on account, summary judgment against the debtor was proper. The court held that each of the guaranties was plain and unambiguous. By taking the lesser of the sums authorized by the evidence, the creditor eliminated any issue of fact as to the total sum due and as to the sum due under each guaranty. The court held that the creditor showed that no fact issue existed with regard to a defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's connection to the adult bookstores' operation was sufficient so that a rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in refusing to allow the out-of-state attorney to represent defendant, sit at counsel table, or talk to defense counsel during the trial. A member of the Georgia Bar represented defendant. The out-of-state attorney was not a member of the Georgia Bar and offered no proof of his admission to practice law in his home state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents alleged claims for inverse condemnation, nuisance, and unlawful trespass arising as a direct and proximate result of the operation of the airport facility and the routing of flights over their property. On appeal, the residents argued that their claims were not preempted by federal regulation. The court found that the residents claims were not preempted. Whether the residents were entitled to recover damages under applicable Georgia law was an issue to be resolved at a later date. If the airplanes, following the traffic patterns and maintaining the altitudes prescribed by the federal regulatory agency, had no alternative but to invade the property in such manner as to constitute nuisance, then the city, by maintaining an airport of which such invasion was an unavoidable incident, was itself maintaining the nuisance and may have been held liable in damages. The regulation promulgated by the federal regulatory agency as to flight altitudes did not determine the rights of the surface owner, either as to trespass or nuisance.</SPAN></P>

Material not otherwise obscene could have been deemed obscene if the distribution was a commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of prurient appeal. The magazines, which were found to be hard-core pornography, were purchased in an adult bookstore after being traced from the warehouse.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of the summary judgment in favor of the wife, the husband contended that much of the wife's back alimony claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The court noted that the wife had the right to apply alimony payments to the oldest amounts owing. She filed an affidavit swearing that she applied all payments to the oldest amount owing, therefore none of the amount sought was barred by the statute. Contrary to the wife's assertion, a claim for modification of a foreign divorce decree was allowed to be asserted in the same action in which domestication of that decree was sought. Thus the superior court's refusal to permit the husband to assert a claim for modification by counterclaim was error if the counterclaim stated a claim upon which relief could have been granted. However, the husband's claim for modification was based on the wife's changed financial condition. At the time of the decree only the husband's changed condition could have formed a basis for modification, and a subsequent statute allowing consideration of either spouse's financial condition did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner purchased a car from the predecessor, who had bought it from a dealer. The dealer had acquired it from another dealer under the provisions of the Georgia Abandoned Motor Vehicle Act, O.G.C.A. &sect; 68-23. The bank repossessed the car without the owner's knowledge or permission, claiming that it had a perfected security interest in the car created by its initial owner, who had abandoned the vehicle. After the bank sold the car, the owner sued the bank and the predecessor alleging that the bank had converted the car and that the predecessor had breached the warranty of title accompanying the car. On appeal from the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants, the court held that where &sect; 68-23 had been found unconstitutional, any title purporting to derive from the dealer's acquisition of the vehicle under such Act was wholly void and the owner had no title to protect despite the fact that he had purchased the car in good faith and without notice of the flaw in title.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that a fact issue existed as to whether the city appropriated the goods purchased to its own use after abolishing the recreation commission. The court held that one who accepted possession of goods and permitted them to be used for his benefit could not defeat an action for the purchase price by denying that the person who purchased them had authority to act as his agent.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the State presented evidence which established that the corporation and the cinema were one and the same and that the cinema was incorporated for the purpose of running a theatre that was in accordance with Georgia law. The court determined that all of the evidence relative to knowledge on the part of the owners showed no other reasonable hypothesis save that of guilt, and it was not error for the trial court to omit giving a charge on circumstantial evidence, absent a request. The court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101 was not violative of U.S. Const. amends.

The court held that (1) defendant's contention that O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 26-2907, 26-9915a were unconstitutional could not have been considered on appeal because it was not raised in the trial court; those statutes specifically provided that defendant had the burden of establishing his entitlement to possess the weapons under the exemptions set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; &sect; 26-2906, 26-9912a; (2) the gun dealer's testimony was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with criminal intent in making the purchases; (3) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the indictment on the ground that he had not received a commitment hearing; and (4) any error by the trial court in initially failing to charge the jury on the exemptions listed in O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-9914a was cured by a subsequent instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant vendor brought an action for declaratory judgment against appellees, a county and others, in which it sought a declaration that 1962 Ga. Laws 2364 had been rendered illegal and unenforceable by O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2713(b), which exempted certain devices from criminal gambling laws. The Gwinnett Superior Court (Georgia) dismissed the action on the ground that the vendor had failed to state a claim for declaratory relief. The vendor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The vendor sold and leased coin-operated amusement devices such as pinball machines. After it contracted to supply such devices to a bowling facility, law enforcement officials told the vendor that they would prosecute it under 1962 Ga. Laws 2364 if the machines were installed. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition. O.C.G.A. &sect; 110-1111 stated that the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act was to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations and that it was to be liberally construed. Here, an actual controversy existed in that appellees contended that the statute was valid whereas the vendor claimed that it had been invalidated by later gambling legislation. Absent a determination of the validity of the statute, the vendor was uncertain and insecure with respect to its plans. The vendor merely sought a determination of what the existing law was with respect to pinball machines and similar devices in the county; it was not required to violate a law about which there was an actual controversy concerning its enforceability and suffer a criminal prosecution in order to test its validity.</SPAN></P>

The broker brought an action against the corporation to recover the fee, alleging that an in-state real estate license was not required if the contract was out of state and that he was merely a referral agent not a broker. The corporation filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion. On the broker's appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 1404(a) required an in-state license in order for a claimant to bring an action to recover a broker's fee, that the state of the contract was irrelevant, that the broker met the statutory definitions of a broker, &sect;&sect; 84-1401(b), 84-1402(a), that the broker acted and held himself out as a broker, rather than a referral agent, that the corporation was not estopped by its knowledge of his out of state license because of public policy considerations, and that the broker's constitutional challenge to the statute as applied was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The State sought review of the trial court's post-conviction determination that the showing of several obscene films as a single theatre exhibition constituted one count of violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, defendants were convicted of six counts of distributing obscene material. However, upon a motion for a new trial, the trial court ordered the verdict and sentences of five of the counts to be set aside. The trial court concluded that when a single, uninterrupted, continuous showing of six different films was made to a single movie-goer for one indivisible price and a single exhibition, the exhibition constituted one crime. It was the exhibition of the material that made the conduct criminal. Upon review, the court found that the six different films shown in the same exhibition did not constitute six distinct criminal acts under &sect; 26-2101. Defendants objected to the trial court's instructions that they presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of their actions. The court found that the instruction created a permissive presumption that allowed, rather than required the jury to infer an element of the crime. Because it was more likely than not that defendants intended the natural and probable consequences of their acts, the presumption was rational.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendants convictions for distributing obscene material. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that their conduct amounted to one violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that &sect; 84-1421 did not authorize the Commission to punish by rules and regulations unless dishonest or criminal activity was involved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The brokers were licensed to do business in South Carolina and had entered into a non-exclusive listing agreement with the purchaser concerning the sale of a large tract of land in North Carolina. A contract for the sale was culminated in a contract in Georgia. The court affirmed, finding that the brokers needed to be licensed in Georgia as a prerequisite to filing suit pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-1404. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-1402 the brokers needed to be licensed in Georgia before receiving any valuable consideration or offers. The court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-1404(a) made reference to a Georgia license under O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-1415, which allowed for a reciprocal agreement with the State Real Estate Commission to be issued a non-resident broker's license. If O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 84-1402 and 1404 were interpreted to only apply to residents it would make O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-1415 meaningless. The court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-1404 was constitutional and well within the reasonable exercise of the police power of the state to protect the public from fraud, misrepresentation, incompetence, and sharp practices.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no abuse of discretion in admitting a photograph of a car owned by defendant's mother, and that testimony regarding the character of a nightclub frequented by both defendant and the prosecutrix was properly excluded. Because defendant failed to express his intention of going into matters regarding the prosecutrix's sex life, as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-202.1(a), and did not request an in camera hearing to determine if such evidence was admissible, the trial court properly refused to allow such testimony.</SPAN></P>

The borrowers demanded proof that the lender was licensed and that it operated in accordance with the Industrial Loan Act. The Georgia Supreme Court reversed the initial order for summary judgment in favor of the lender on grounds that it failed to show that it was properly licensed. On remand, the trial court again granted summary judgment in favor of the lender. On appeal, the court reversed. The lender was not entitled to summary judgment because the borrowers raised an issue of fact regarding whether any amount was owed on the notes and admitted only to the fact that the notes were genuine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An off-duty police officer from another state with two years experience in narcotics work alerted local officers that defendants were in a restaurant waiting to make a sale.

The court held that the trial court had not erred in denying defendants' motion to suppress because probable cause and exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless arrest and subsequent search of the vehicle existed. Further, the court found that sufficient evidence that was not entirely circumstantial in nature supported defendants' conviction and that at least constructive possession of the contraband was sufficiently proved as to each defendant. Finally, the court determined that because it was a court for the correction of errors of law only pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3108, there was no error with respect to the trial court's failure to sua sponte appoint new counsel for one or more defendants in light of the fact the issue of joint representation had not been raised prior to trial by any defendant.</SPAN></P>

His complaint that there were no standards to be applied in determining just which words would be obscene and vulgar was answered adversely to him in prior case law. Under controlling case law, it was held that language was obscene, vulgar or profane when, under the circumstances and manner in which such utterance was made, it would have clearly offended a reasonable person's sense of decency. The court held that the jury could have properly found that defendant's statements over the telephone, that were made unidentified and unprovoked, on two occasions, would clearly have offended a reasonable person's sense of decency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured individual suffered injuries when she fell after alighting from a truck. The injured individual alleged that the city was negligent in failing to maintain an adequate curb. The injured individual stipulated on appeal that she did not give to the city the ante litem notice of her claim within six months of the date of the incident as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 69-308. Thus, the trial judge granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The injured individual appealed from the decision contending that the statute was unconstitutional. She further asserted that a proper constitutional attack was made with the trial judge and thus the issue was preserved for appellate review. The court found that the injured individual never alleged in her pleadings that the statute was unconstitutional. Therefore, the issue could not be reviewed on appeal. The court also stated that there was no merit in the injured individual's assertion that her stipulation that she had not complied with the statute sufficiently raised the constitutional issue. The court found the injured individual had not met the requirements necessary to raise a question regarding the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Three months later, however, the lower court entered another decree that directed the clerk of court to transmit to the court a supplemental record consisting of the original petition in the case because, through oversight, it omitted to endorse the oral answer of the debtor made at the hearing. The court reversed the judgment that denied the debtor's motion to set aside, by holding that the failure to endorse his answer upon the petition was a nonamendable defect that was subject to his motion to set aside because the proceeding under the Act was statutory, and it had to be strictly construed and observed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that this argument was without merit because Georgia's obscenity statute previously survived an identical attack. Defendant next contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress and in allowing into evidence items seized by the police officer without a warrant. The officer testified that the only materials seized were in plain view in the store. This seizure therefore came within the plain view doctrine and the trial court did not err in overruling the motion to suppress. The court found that the materials were obscene as a matter of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Authorities, who were investigating illegal gambling, obtained a warrant to conduct a wiretap in Walton County. The application for the warrant complied with the requirements of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-3004(c) (1968), and the warrant that was issued authorized a 20 day wiretap. Information obtained from the wiretaps was given to authorities in Fulton County, who obtained a warrant to establish their own wiretap in that county. All but one of the monitoring personnel followed an acceptable procedure in minimizing intercepts of nonpertinent calls. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on charges of communicating gambling information, and held that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress the wiretaps was not error. There was no illegal taint in the inception of the Walton County warrant and no abuse of judicial discretion in issuing the warrant for 20 days, and the disclosure of evidence obtained from the Walton County wiretap to other law enforcement officers was authorized and appropriate. The interception of a limited number of nonpertinent calls by one of the monitoring personnel did not contaminate the legally intercepted calls.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 3-512 was in effect from its enactment and caused the automatic dismissal of the case by operation of law. The overruling of the former judicial decision was retrospective in its operation and the effect was not that the former decision was bad law, but that it was never the law. An exception could apply, where constitutional or statutory law had been construed by the appellate courts and contracts had been made and vested rights acquired in accordance with the construction of the law, retrospective application would not be made.

The court held that the trial court correctly construed the provisions of the decree and concluded that child support payments were to be continued even though one of the children was not living with the mother because the child was not self-supporting. The father was entitled to have the amount paid directly to the holder of a mortgage on the parties' home credited toward payment of child support because an equitable exception existed to the rule that the parties could not change a court decree of support. The mortgage payments were not a modification or reduction of the father's payment because he paid the total amount ordered each month and the children received the benefit of the funds paid as it provided them a home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed an action against defendants seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the interpretation of 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq., which provided for the federal government making payments in lieu of taxes to units of local government for certain federal lands located within their boundaries. Plaintiffs sought construction of the statute whereby all funds payable thereunder be divided in proportion to the millage rates between the board of education and the county or that the county would be authorized to pay the funds to the board of education should it desire. The trial court held that it was not mandatory that the governing authority share the funds with the school board on a proportionate basis, that the county was not restricted by law from paying over any of the funds to the school board, and that the governing authority could allocate a portion of the funds to the school board if it desired to do so. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment and ruled that plaintiffs essentially sought redress from the wrong forum. No attack was made as to the authority of the legislative agency to issue the regulations, and the court was not empowered with such rule making powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver had previously filed pleas of nolo contendere to three separate charges of driving under the influence (DUI) and to one charge for using a vehicle to elude a police officer arising from a separate incident. The driver also had a bond forfeiture on a DUI charge. The driver's license was revoked for five years after a hearing under &sect; 68B-308. On appeal to the superior court, a finding was entered that the Commissioner had only shown two of the three convictions required as the bond forfeiture did not constitute a conviction and convictions obtained before the effective date of &sect; 68B-308 could not be considered. On the Commissioner's appeal, the court reversed. The court determined that the bond forfeiture could be considered a conviction as defined in O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-101(b)(3) in determining habitual offender status. While the driver argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-312(a)(3) was an ex post facto law in allowing convictions prior to the effective date of O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-308 to be considered, the court held that a similar statute was found by the state supreme court not to be ex post facto and noted that the prior convictions only increased the penalty for the most recent crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that his sentence of 10 years was excessive as a matter of law and therefore, void. Specifically, defendant argued that the indictment charged defendant with violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-3201, conspiracy to commit a crime, which permitted a maximum confinement penalty of only five years. Defendant also asserted that O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-812 was unconstitutional. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court found that the name given to the crime on the indictment was not what characterized it. The descriptive language in the presentment was the controlling factor. The court reasoned that the allegations plainly and unambiguously charged defendant with a violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-812. Defendant's 10-year sentence was consequently within the authorized maximum under O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-811(b). Defendant's constitutionality argument was first presented on appeal and as such, presented nothing for consideration by the court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the result of the blood test was admissible under &sect; 68A-902.1(a)(3) because it was clearly shown that defendant was unconscious during the period when such advice would have been of benefit to him. Second, defendant objected to a lab technician's testimony on the ground that the highest and best evidence of his certification was some type of original document from the state crime laboratory. The court held that it was not error to admit the testimony because the witness stated that he was in fact so certified and produced what he said was a permit card issued to him by the state crime laboratory. Third, defendant objected to the introduction of testimony of the blood test results because the chain of custody for the blood sample was not properly established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1977 Ga. Laws 3201 amended the city's procedures for overriding the mayor's veto of resolutions by stating that such action had to be taken at the next regular meeting held by the city council after such veto. Prior to the enactment of 1977 Ga. Laws 3201, the city council passed a resolution providing that the proposed legislation would not affect outstanding vetoes. However, the provision was not included in the subsequent statute that became law. The court found that the omission of such language was a clear indication of legislative intent that the statute would control outstanding vetoes. To avoid retroactive or retrospective application of the statute, the court determined that the statute could be reasonably construed to set up a cut-off date for overriding outstanding vetoes as the first city council meeting after the enactment of the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the city council's attempted override of the mayor's veto was not timely raised at the first city council meeting after the enactment of 1977 Ga. Laws 3201. The time for the city council to override the mayor's veto had expired before they attempted any action to do so.</SPAN></P>

He was then promoted to the duties of foreman, but he never received the corresponding salary increase. After repeated requests to the county for the extra pay, the employee brought a claim with the county merit council. The council denied his claim; however, the council lacked authority to render a binding decision because it was only authorized to hear appeals from employees who had been dismissed The employee then brought an independent action against the county to recover the back pay. The county brought a summary judgment motion. The trial court granted the motion, and the employee appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the county was protected by sovereign immunity, which applied to any action involving claims for injury or damage against the state unless there was a waiver by the legislature. Because the county was an arm of the state, and there was no statutory waiver of sovereign immunity applicable to the employee's action, the grant of summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's oral motion to suppress his confession of the theft was overruled, over his objections that he was denied counsel prior to signing the confession, and that he was offered, as a reward for signing, an accusation alleging only one theft for the book of tickets rather than 19, one for each individual ticket. The court affirmed. There was at least a strong suggestion that defendant was led to believe that he was gaining by his confession the advantage of a one-count rather than a 19-count accusation against him. Defendant, although the Miranda rights had been read to him, had no attorney at the time, and contended on appeal that he asked for and was refused counsel prior to signing the confession. However, the court was required to uphold the judgment of the trial court that was supported by competent evidence unless it was clearly erroneous, meaning legally insufficient. Obviously the voluntariness of the confession was a jury question and could not be &quot;clearly erroneous&quot; on conflicting evidence, although a jury might have found otherwise.</SPAN></P>

He contended that since he was a first offender, he was entitled to a limited driving permit upon a showing of extreme hardship. The Commissioner contended that the driver was not a first offender and introduced evidence of a prior plea of nolo contendere and conviction of the same offense, driving under the influence. The prior offense was within the 10-year period called for by O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-311 but before the enactment of the same. The trial judge held that the statute could not have been applied retroactively and that therefore the driver was a first offender. On appeal, the court held that the fact that the offense that served to disqualify the driver as a first offender occurred prior to the enactment of the statute did not serve to give such statute an unconstitutional or illegal retroactive effect. The trial court erred in finding that the driver was a first offender and in modifying the suspension order so as to permit the driver a limited driving permit.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that there was ample evidence that defendant was under the influence of alcohol while he had been driving the vehicle. The court also found that evidence of a blood alcohol test was admissible because the test was administered while defendant was under arrest and because the taking of his blood did not cause him to be a witness against himself within the meaning of Fifth Amendment protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer criticized the deputy director of the Atlanta Bureau of Police Services in a newspaper article.

Upon further review the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that Rule 511 was not unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, or indefinite. The court found that the prohibition against communicating &quot;official information&quot; to others outside the Bureau was reasonable in order to maintain discipline and efficiency so as to best accomplish its mission of public safety, and thus did not violate the officer's right to free speech. The court determined that Rule 511 was not unconstitutional as applied to the officer because his comments were addressed at a superior with whom he had a close working relationship, and thus his remarks were disruptive to the Bureau's discipline and harmony.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion was denied and judgment on a jury verdict was entered in favor of plaintiff.

Instead of being absolutely bound to rebuild the building and to seek replacement costs only, plaintiff could seek actual damages under the policy. Further, evidence did not demand a finding that the policy was void because the evidence showed plaintiff's efforts regarding proof of loss.

The trial court entered a judgment that convicted defendant on two counts of distributing obscene materials, which the court affirmed. The court held that the denial of defendant's motion for separate trials on the two counts was not erroneous. The two offenses arose from the same conduct, occurred at the same place, and involved the same persons. Further, the evidence was not of such complexity as to hinder the trier of fact in being able to distinguish the evidence and apply the law intelligently as to each offense. The trial court also did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The magazines were not seized, but purchased by an investigating officer. The magazines clearly gave the officer probable cause to arrest defendant. Also, the seizure of the devices came within the plain view doctrine because they were on display in plain view to anyone who walked into defendant's store. The depiction of sexual conduct, and the use of the devices, were patently offensive and obscene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court affirmed a ruling by the county merit council suspending and dismissing the fireman for failure to abide by its regulation governing hair length. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment upholding the suspension, reversed the judgment upholding dismissal, and remanded. The court held the hair length relation was specific and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that a prehearing dismissal notice was fatally deficient because it failed to include allegations of tardiness and absences without leave, which were presented at the hearing. The court further ruled the fireman was not given access to his personnel file, which was used by the chief of the department during testimony at the hearing. The court stated the fireman's interest in obtaining information to rebut charges outweighed the county merit council's interests of privacy and confidentiality of its personnel files. The court further ruled that common law did not provide the fireman with a due process right to a hearing prior to his dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and two others were charged with the rape and murder of a woman who was 66 years old. Defendant severed his trial and was acquitted of murder and convicted of rape only. On appeal, defendant raised ten alleged errors. The court affirmed. First, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to authorize the jury's verdict. The court further held that defendant admitted that the victim was drunk and that sexual intercourse with a woman whose will was temporarily lost from intoxication, or unconsciousness arising from use of drugs or other cause, or sleep, was rape. Further, the court held that the admission of evidence reflecting the guilt or innocence of the accused's co-conspirators was proper because the record showed that there was a prima facie showing of conspiracy between the accused and his co-indictees. Finally, the court held that defendant failed to timely object to the composition of both the grand jury and the traverse jury on the basis the it underrepresented black people and women.</SPAN></P>
