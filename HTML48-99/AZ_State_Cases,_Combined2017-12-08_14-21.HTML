</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which convicted him of second degree burglary, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1507, and sentenced him to more than 11 years in prison, to run consecutively to other sentences he was serving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to admit jail medical records in relation to an insanity defense. He also contended that his trial attorney could not waive defendant's presence for the exercise of peremptory challenges and that the trial court erred in failing to state a reason for imposing a consecutive sentence. On review, the court upheld the convictions but not the imposition of a consecutive sentence. The trial judge had directed defendant to select those parts of the jail medical exhibit that were relevant so they could be admitted, but defendant failed to do so. Defendant was entitled to be present at critical stages of the proceedings, and such stages generally included the peremptory challenges. However, the court held that counsel could waive defendant's presence at such proceedings as a matter of trial strategy. The court found no basis for setting aside the jury's unanimous finding of guilt. The court concluded, however, that the trial court erred in failing to explain the reasons for the consecutive sentence, as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-708. Thus, defendant was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction, but it vacated and remanded for resentencing. If the sentence imposed was again made consecutive to other sentences, the trial court was instructed to comply with the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner widow sought review of a judgment of the Industrial Commission of Arizona, which reduced an award, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1046(C), to 60 percent of a full widow's award on the basis that the widow was an alien who did not reside in the United States at the time of her husband's work-related death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow claimed that &sect; 23-1046(C) established an unconstitutional classification on the basis of alienage and thereby deprived her of the equal protection of the laws. She also claimed a denial of procedural due process. On review, the court found no denial of any constitutional rights. The court indicated it did not need to address the employer's claim that equal protection was not applicable, because even under the Equal Protection clause, the statutory provision was lawful. The widow was not a resident of the United States on the date of her husband's death and had always resided in Mexico. Consequently, her challenge to &sect; 23-1046(C) was analyzed under the &quot;rational basis&quot; test, but she failed to establish that the classification was arbitrary and could not be justified under any reasonable set of facts. The court found that the rationale in &sect; 23-1046(C) had a rational relationship to a permissible state objective. The widow was provided with an adequate opportunity to vindicate her factual and legal claims of entitlement to full death benefits, consistent with procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate sought review of an action of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which upheld certain time computations made by respondent State through its Department of Corrections in regard to the inmate's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate claimed the Department's recomputation of his time credits was an ex post facto application of law to him. The court granted review but denied relief. The inmate alleged two instances of recomputations under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 31-251, 31-252 to disallow double-time credit during mandatory release and to disallow stacking of credits. The Department's prior erroneous interpretation of the statutes did not have the force and effect of law. Thus, applying its new, correct interpretation was not an ex post facto violation. The inmate was not entitled to earn work release credit under &sect; 31-252 during periods of mandatory release. The plain language of the statute required that the inmate perform an assignment of confidence and trust, which was not the case with an inmate on mandatory release. The court held that the Department's unstacking computation was also a correct interpretation of the law. The purpose of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-251(B) was better served by not stacking good behavior credits because the statutory formula for increasing credits applied to the maximum sentence term, and each consecutive sentence was separate and distinct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, city and city manager, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Cochise County (Arizona), which granted appellee employees a preliminary injunction prohibiting the city from requiring the employees to take a polygraph examination under threat of dismissal. The city was investigating allegations that the employees were using city time and personnel to perform personal duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees and co-workers were observed in a part of town that was in the opposite direction from where they were supposed to be working. The city also received an anonymous call that the employees engaged in personal projects while on city time. When questioned, the employees admitted to engaging in a personal project. The employees were ordered to take a polygraph examination after reports of the incident were inconclusive. The employees then denied any involvement and sought injunctive relief. The trial court found that requiring the employees to submit to polygraph examinations was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious as it arose out of an alleged incident wherein the employees were used for a few minutes to place a barbecue grate on a barbecue grill. The court reversed. It found that it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious to order the examination when there was a charge that the employees were using city time and personnel to perform personal duties, and where the city manager, having exhausted his investigative tools, saw the polygraph as an alternative and did not order the testing until he consulted with the city attorney to determine if it was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Arizona Civil Rights Division (division) challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which dismissed the division's action against appellees, a county and its officials. The division's action was brought under the Arizona Civil Rights Act (Act), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1401 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A matron at the sheriff's department alleged that she was a victim of sexual discrimination because male jailers were paid more for performing essentially the same duties. She filed a complaint with the division, which filed an action against appellees. The lower court dismissed the division's action under the Act and it sought review. The court reversed the dismissal and determined that the employee's charge alleged a violation of the Act. The Act, which was patterned after Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e et seq., was required to be read in conjunction with the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 206. Under the EPA, an employer was not permitted to discriminate on the basis of sex in the payment of wages. Classification systems that relegated women to lower paying jobs were disallowed if the job content was substantially the same. Appellees did not share the state's immunity because they were political subdivisions of the state. The division's investigative action did not deprive appellees of life, liberty, or property. Finally, the division was not required to complete reasonable conciliation attempts before filing suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the dismissal of the division's action filed under the Act. The case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Despite defendant's repeated efforts to continue the trial date, the case proceeded to trial, and defendant was convicted. When the deputy returned following trial but before sentencing, defendant moved for a new trial; however, the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not denied the right to compulsory process under U.S. Const. amend. VI because there was no governmental conduct, which interfered with defendant's exercise of his constitutional rights, in that the deputy simply took a leave of absence to which she was entitled.

The court held that prosecution was required to prove defendant committed the crime &quot;knowingly.&quot; However, the court held that under the faulty law, it was not necessary to do so if defendant was intoxicated because &sect; 13-0503 did not apply to crimes where the required mental state was &quot;knowingly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The parties disputed whether a 1974 recorded homestead declaration was void. The declaration of homestead lacked an express statement of Arizona residency and designated the property value as a sum not exceeding the statutory exemption limit. The court affirmed, holding that a declaration of homestead that completely omitted any of the statutory requirements set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-1102 was fatally defective and conferred no exemption rights upon the declarants. Further, a reference to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-1101, which references residency, in the declaration was still insufficient. Because the declaration of homestead was invalid on the basis of the lack of residency requirement, the court did not determine whether the valuation portion of the declaration passed statutory muster.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that state law and local zoning and planning ordinances were preempted by the federal regulatory scheme under the Federal Aviation Act.

Plaintiffs appealed from the adverse decision of the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court that federal preemption applied to the case and that the state court's injunctive power was not exempt from preemption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) convicted defendant of two counts of kidnapping and 14 counts of sexual assault. The trial court found aggravating circumstances and that all of the crimes were of a dangerous nature after three previous convictions for non-dangerous felonies. The trial court sentenced defendant to presumptive terms of 15.75 years for each offense. The sentences were to run concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant kidnapped and repeatedly raped two women at knifepoint. Defendant alleged that the prosecutor's closing remarks were improper appeals to the jury's sympathy and passion and that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences. The court held that the prosecutor's closing statement was not improper because it was founded on relevant evidence regarding the victim's testimony and demeanor. The court held that the trial court properly overruled defendant's objections to the argument. Defendant alleged that, since all of the offenses were committed on the same occasion, he could not be sentenced to consecutive terms for the different convictions. The court held that the trial court properly imposed consecutive sentences pursuant Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-708. The court held that defendant's interpretation of the sentencing statutes was contrary to law. Defendant effectively proposed that a sentence for numerous offenses occurring in the same incident could not exceed the sentence that applied to a single offense.</SPAN></P>

The court found that both of the statutory deduction disallowance sections at issue indicted that a deduction was to be disallowed only if it was &quot;connected with&quot; the tax-exempt income. No such connection was demonstrated here. Also, the court found that Ariz. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-297.01. The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), entered summary judgment for the private hospital, awarding the cost of services rendered after the medical bills had reduced his income to the requisite eligibility limit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three weeks after the patient was taken to the private hospital for emergency treatment, he was transferred to the county hospital. The private hospital sought reimbursement from the county for the patient's treatment. The county argued that it had no obligation to reimburse the private hospital because the patient did not qualify as an indigent when admitted. The private hospital contended that the patient became indigent when his hospital bill reached $ 2,476, leaving him with a gross income of less than the $ 2,100 under the guidelines or, in the alternative, that he was an &quot;employable of sworn low income&quot; under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-297(A). The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-297.01(B) did not require that the patient be indigent upon admission. The statutory reference to &quot;employable of sworn low income&quot; did not create additional categories of people entitled to receive care at public expense. Sufficient notice was given to the county after his treating physician deemed it medically advisable to transport him. The private hospital was entitled to reimbursement at the &quot;Medicaid&quot; rate retroactive to the time when the patient became qualified as an indigent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which convicted defendant of first-degree burglary, armed robbery, theft, kidnapping in one incident; first-degree burglary, armed robbery, kidnapping, and theft in a second incident; and unlawful possession of a narcotic drug, in a third incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that when officers entered his neighbor's backyard, in order to line up the landmarks on the photograph, they conducted an illegal search because: (1) he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his rear yard; and (2) because a boy was incapable of giving consent to the officers' entry of his backyard. The court found that defendant could not object to any claimed illegal entry of his neighbor's yard. The court found that defendant's backyard was open to physical access and viewing from his neighbor's backyard, and hence defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy. The court rejected defendant's contention that the motion to suppress evidence found in the cardboard box in the closet in defendant's house should have been granted because of the officers' illegal act of adding items to the search warrant after the warrant was issued and approved by the magistrate. The court reversed some of defendant's convictions because the trial court's instruction to the jury negated defendant's presumption of innocence in that it could lead a reasonable juror to believe that defendant was required to prove that the weapon was not deadly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for two counts of theft, two counts of kidnapping, and unlawful possession of a narcotic drug. The court affirmed defendant's sentences on two counts of theft and unlawful possession of a narcotic drug, except the part that required the sentences to be served consecutively. The court reversed defendant's convictions for two counts of first degree burglary and two counts of armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in favor of respondents. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 16-341(C) violated the Fourteenth Amendment because there was no compelling state interest in prohibiting persons from signing nomination petitions for independent candidates when their party had no candidate for such office in the primary election.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1041 to award benefits to respondent employee based on both the monthly amount that she received from her employer and the tips that she received from customers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured while working as a cocktail waitress. The commission's administrative law judge issued his findings and award based on both the monthly amounts that the employee received from her employer and the tips that she received from her customers. The judge affirmed his decision after a request for review. On appeal, the court affirmed the award. The court did not necessarily agree that tips should be included in computing an injured worker's average monthly wage under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1041 and considered the issue one that was more properly addressed in the legislative process. Nevertheless, the principle of stare decisis compelled the court to follow judicial precedent holding that tips are part of the average monthly wage. The court concluded that it was not unconstitutional to apply the judicial precedent, even though insurance regulations did not permit the carrier to assess premiums based on tips, because the department of insurance could change its regulations to conform to the change in case law. Finally, the court concluded that the applicable precedent authorized retroactive application of its ruling to injuries occurring before the decision date.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed their conviction for child abuse under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3623(C)(2) , arguing that the trial court erred in admitting the photographs and the testimony of the detective, both of which pertained to the condition of the home. Defendants further argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss on the basis that &sect; 13-3623(C)(2) was unconstitutional, and that the trial court had erred in admitting photographs of a previous investigation of the home. The court affirmed, holding that the detective had the right to search the premises where the five children were and look for the children and any thing that posed a threat to them. Further, the court held that since the entry into the house was lawful, the later entry of the police photographer to preserve what the detective saw was also lawful.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1831 seeking to have certain zoning ordinances declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the developers were denied a special use permit to construct a tennis resort, they claimed that a zoning ordinance providing that all nonresidential uses in the town were nonconforming or special uses was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional. The court rejected the developers' argument that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.01A.1 prohibited the town from classifying all the land in the town in the residential large-lot zone. Section 9-462.01A.1 was a permissive statute and neither required nor suggested that any of all the zone types listed be enacted by the town. Second, the record showed a reasonable basis for the action of the town council in denying the special use permit: concern for floodplain development, lack of sufficient preliminary plans, and the lack of a model. Next, the court rejected the contention that the zoning classification for the land was unconstitutional as it had no substantial relation to the health, safety, and welfare of the town. Finally, the court was required to uphold the ordinance as the question of rezoning was &quot;fairly debatable&quot; and purely a legislative decision for the town council.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant ran a boarding home. She was charged with the death of a woman in her care. Defendant had put an employee, a 17 year old girl, in charge of the woman. The woman died of starvation. Defendant challenged the admissibility of certain pictures, the sufficiency of the evidence, and giving of a jury instruction. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant contended that the giving of an instruction required reversal because it permitted her to be convicted of acts which were not crimes, failed to inform the jury of the necessity of causation, allowed her to be convicted solely on the culpability of another person, allowed conviction for violation of moral duties, and was a comment on the evidence. The court did not agree with defendant. The court held that, as stated in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-201 and demonstrated by the case law, the failure to perform a duty imposed by law can create criminal liability. The court also held that photographs, even though they may be gruesome in nature, are admissible to illustrate how the crime was committed and to aid the jurors in understanding the testimony.

Plaintiffs filed their complaint against defendants, county and related individuals, alleging medical malpractice and battery. In a prior special action by plaintiffs, the court denied jurisdiction over the denial of a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants set forth as a defense Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-562(B) which provided that no medical malpractice action could be based on battery. Plaintiffs sought to strike the defense as &quot;insufficient&quot;, claiming that &sect; 12-562(B) was unconstitutional. The trial court denied their motion to strike the defense, to change venue, and for partial summary judgment. Although the case was still pending trial, the trial court's order contained Ariz. R. Civ. P. 54(b) language and stated that it was a final order as to those motions. On appeal, defendants contended that neither an order denying a motion for change of venue nor an order refusing to strike a defense as insufficient was appealable and that neither were made appealable by the addition of Rule 54(b) language. The court agreed and dismissed the appeal. The denials of a motion for summary judgment and a change of venue were not appealable. Also, the court held that denying a motion to strike an affirmative defense from an answer was not appealable. Plaintiffs were still entitled to proceed with their evidence on both theories of liability. The validity of the affirmative defense was not determined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after the police found a &quot;nunchaku&quot; under the front seat of his vehicle. He was found guilty by the trial court, sitting without a jury, and placed on probation.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-3102(A)(3) and 13-3101(6)(e). Defendant contended that the statutes were unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and reasoned that an offense had to be defined in terms that people of average intelligence understood and the due process clause required only that the law gave sufficient warning that people may conform their conduct to its dictates. The court found that the statutes did not prevent the use of nunchakus in the peaceful practice of the martial arts and that the possession for such use was not a crime.

The court affirmed and determined that the claimant, as a federal civil service employee and as a member of the military service, was working for the same employer. The court found that under Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission granted the fire company a certificate of public convenience and necessity for providing fire protection services to certain areas of Arizona not protected by a municipal fire department.

The court rejected the trial court's conclusion that Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, city and its director of finance, sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which granted appellee owners' motion for summary judgment and held that Tucson, Ariz., Ordinance 4783 was unconstitutional. The owners had filed a declaratory action and sought to declare the ordinance, which provided for the licensing and regulation of adult entertainment enterprises, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners operated adult entertainment enterprises and refused to apply for a license under the ordinance. The trial court granted the owners' motion for summary judgment and held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellants sought review, and the court reversed the trial court's order, and remanded the case. The court held that nude or partially nude dancing performances were included in the definition of adult entertainment enterprise despite Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7-208(7), which stated that dancing may be protected by the first amendment. The court ruled that because a protected first amendment activity was subject to the licensing requirements, the ordinance had to set forth definite, objective guidelines for the issuance of licenses. The court found that &sect; 7-212(3) was infirm but that the rest of &sect; 7-212 was not. The court held that &sect; 7-215 was unconstitutional because it gave appellants discretionary power. Whether there was a rational basis to &sect; 7-209 remained a factual issue. The owners did not have standing to challenge the part of the ordinance, which disqualified the owners if they were convicted of certain crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, which granted the owners' motion for summary judgment and found that the ordinance was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his conviction for nine counts of possession of altered property was improper because the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for one count and reversed on the remaining counts. Defendant possessed nine dismantled vehicles without serial numbers in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2306(A). Further, defendant could not prove that he owned, or that he was storing the vehicles. The court also found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;13-2301(B)(1) defined the term &quot;dealer&quot; such that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2306(A) was not void for vagueness. The court also found that defendant's right to equal protection of the laws was not violated by &sect; 13-2306(A). The court reasoned that the classification under &sect; 13-2306(A) did not involve a suspect class of persons or a constitutionally protected interest, and was not wholly unrelated to the objectives of the state's action. The purpose of the statute was to prevent stolen automobiles from being sold through legitimate channels. Finally, the court found that defendant could only be convicted of one count. The court reasoned that defendant's possession was one act of transaction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff City of Tucson filed an action against defendants, attorney general and taxing authorities, requesting an order directing the attorney general to certify that certain property tax increment bonds could be issued. The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) ruled that the bonds were invalid and that the tax increment scheme set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-1481 and 36-1488.01 violated Ariz. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city authorized the issuance of $ 1.5 million of property tax increment bonds for a project pursuant to the state's slum clearance and redevelopment law. The issue before the court was whether the bonds constituted a debt of the city which &quot;affected&quot; it, requiring an election under Ariz. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13. Affirming the trial court, the court held that the tax increment financing scheme set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-1481 and 36-1488.01 was unconstitutional under Ariz. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13. The key constitutional infirmity in the tax increment statutes was that they allowed the pledge of proceeds from ad valorem taxation to pay off municipal property tax increment bonds. Even though the incremental tax revenues were placed into a special fund, the &quot;special fund&quot; doctrine did not remove the bonds from the category of obligations that had to be approved by the voters. Further, the electors of the affected district were entitled to accept or reject a proposed expenditure that pledged their district's general taxing power. Therefore, an election was required even if the proposed increase in indebtedness would not violate constitutional debt limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding the bond issue invalid and the tax increment financing scheme unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1831 et seq., against appellees, government officials, and granted their motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the rate payer lacked standing and that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-401 et seq. were constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rate payer alleged that an annual tax was assessed against public service corporations based on their gross operating revenue and that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-408 was unconstitutional because it permitted sums raised for the purposes of utility regulation to be used for purposes unrelated to regulation. The rate payer further claimed that he had standing to bring the action because the assessment charged the public service corporations under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-401 was passed on to him by an increase in rates. The court affirmed, holding that whether or not the rates were raised to reflect the tax imposed by statute was a managerial decision. There was no obligation to raise the rates to meet the assessment. Therefore, the rate payer was not a &quot;party affected by the statute&quot; within the meaning of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1832. Further, the claim failed to set forth sufficient allegations to state a claim for relief, i.e., there was no justiciable controversy alleged. There was no legal relationship in which the rate payer had a definite interest. Because the government officials had no power to deny the rate payer's interests, no controversy existed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of the sale of obscene items, in violation of &sect; 13-532(A)(2), (B). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the prosecutor's prejudicial statements attributed to the brother's case did not extend to defendant due to the clear distinction established by the evidence between the brother, as owner, and defendant, as an employee. Further, substantial evidence supported defendant's conviction. Additionally, the prosecutor did not improperly attempt to impeach witnesses by asking them about specific acts of misconduct unsupported by a conviction because there were no proper objections, and the evidence was admissible to prove defendant's knowledge or scienter. Moreover, there was no prohibition limiting resubmission of evidence to another grand jury. Finally, the court held that the Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with one count of unlawful sale of a narcotic drug, a non-dangerous felony with two prior non-dangerous felonies, and was subject to a possible maximum prison sentence of 28 years.

Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that police officers had probable cause to believe they would find seizable material in defendant's car and that automobiles, because of their mobility, may have been searched without a warrant upon facts that would not justify a warrantless search of a residence. The court held that Arizona Const., art. 2, &sect; 23 based the right to a 12-person jury on the maximum sentence, not parole eligibility.

Defendant was sentenced to five years on the aggravated assault, one and one half years for unlawful imprisonment, and time served on the endangerment charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ruled in limine that the psychiatrist who examined defendant was not permitted to testify concerning defendant's statements that he was intoxicated.

The trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial. The trial court also denied a motion for mistrial when the victim blurted out on direct examination that defendant had assaulted her in the past. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court held that (1) the psychiatrist's testimony did not violate Ariz. R. Crim. P. 11.7(b)(1) because he based his conclusions upon statements made to him by defendant, not the equivalent of testifying to the content of those statements, (2) any error was harmless because the evidence was merely cumulative, (3) evidence of the prior bad act was admissible because the issue of insanity was raised by defendant, and (4) by sentencing defendant to time served on the endangerment conviction, he was given credit for the time he spent in custody before sentencing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to order a trial de novo. The trial court's rejection of the referee's recommendation and its decision that appellant had committed the offense were based solely on credibility grounds. Although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-231.01 et seq. adequately protected the due process rights of juveniles, it only did so when the trial court rightfully exercised the discretion impliedly granted in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-231.02, which allowed the judge to grant a trial de novo based upon its evaluation of the sufficiency and condition of the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order placing appellant on probation and ordering him to undergo psychiatric treatment. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessor filed a forcible entry and detainer action against the lessee in a justice court to regain possession of the leased premises. The justice entered a judgment in favor of the lessor. The lessee filed a notice of appeal and a motion to waive the appeal bond required by &sect; 12-1179, which required a party appealing a justice court judgment in a forcible entry and detainer action to post a bond in an amount equal to double the amount of the yearly rent. The justice denied the motion. The lessee filed a special action to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 12-1179. The superior court found in favor of the lessee. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 12-179 violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court noted that under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1182(B), a litigant who appealed from a judgment entered by a superior court in a forcible entry and detainer action was merely required to post a bond in an amount that was sufficient to cover the rental value of the premises pending appeal, plus damages and costs.

The debtors challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2402(A)(2), regarding ex parte prejudgment seizures, and sought damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtors had executed a purchase money security agreement with the bank when they bought their mobile home.

The trial court subsequently rendered judgment against the debtors on their counterclaim for damages for the repossession of the home. The court first concluded that the debtors had standing to challenge &sect; 12-2402(A)(2) because the hearing before the trial court on the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 12-2402(A)(2) did not offer them a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue of their liability. However, the court found that &sect; 12-2402(A)(2) met constitutional requirements of the United States Supreme Court for ex parte prejudgment seizures because it provided procedural safeguards that adequately protected the interests of both creditors and debtors. The court therefore held that &sect; 12-2402(A)(2) did not violate the Due Process Clauses of the United States and the Arizona Constitutions as drafted and as applied.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court upheld the tax's constitutionality, review was sought, and the court affirmed. Even though Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1712(2) exempted tenants whose lessors could not be legally or constitutionally subject to the tax, the court held this classification was not violative of equal protection. The court held that in order to maintain equality between the transaction privilege tax on rental income and the rental occupancy tax on pre-existing leases, the legislature had rationally determined to exempt a lease from the rental occupancy tax when a lessor was a tax-immune entity inasmuch as the same lease would be exempt from the transaction privilege tax on rental income if the lessor was a tax-immune entity. The court also held Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to October 1, 1978, the inmate was convicted of robbery and five counts of perjury. Consecutive terms of imprisonment were imposed. At the time of the inmate's convictions, he would have been eligible for parole under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-411(A)(1) on November 21, 1989. However, due to a change in the interpretation of &sect; 31-411 and the extensive October 1, 1978 legislation affecting parole, the inmate's parole eligibility date would have been in 2011. The inmate petitioned for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court held that a prisoner who was convicted prior to October 1, 1978 could be eligible for parole on the first of consecutive sentences after serving the statutory period thereof, even though, if parole was granted, he would not be released from custody but would begin serving time on a second consecutive sentence. Further, 1978 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 164, &sect; 31 required the court to refer to the law at the time of the offense to determine the inmate's parole eligibility, which was April 27, 1988. Finally, the fact that the inmate would have to face the parole board six times did not give rise to ex post facto considerations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was adjudicated delinquent for the theft of a motor vehicle valued less than $ 100, a crime that would have subjected an adult to a maximum prison term of 1.875 years but for which appellant faced possible commitment of over four years.

The court affirmed the judgment but directed that appellant's commitment term could not go beyond his 18th birthday. The Supreme Court of Arizona had specifically held that sentencing disparity between adult and juvenile courts did not violate equal protection guarantees. A juvenile could lose his liberty for a longer period than an adult imprisoned for conviction of the same offense. However, the Supreme Court of Arizona had stricken as unconstitutional&nbsp;Ariz.

The adopted children sought death benefits from respondent employer and its carrier. The Commission denied benefits to the adopted children. The adopted children sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the hearing officer correctly determined that the adopted children's right to a conclusive presumption of dependency as natural children under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1064(A) was severed by virtue of their adoption by another party, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-117. The court concluded that Ariz. Rev.

Chapter 163 of the Laws of 1978, which was a miscellany of appropriations, could not be considered a general appropriations bill; violated the reasonable limits of single subject matter of Ariz.

As a regulation of a privilege, the statute was only subject to the rational relationship test for equal protection.

The trial court, applying Utah law, held that the passenger was barred under the guest statute from bringing suit against defendants and granted summary judgment in defendants' favor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following defendant's guilty pleas, the interrogations were terminated because it was the prosecutors' belief that defendant was not being truthful. Defendant filed a motion and a civil action, seeking to compel the state to comply with the plea agreement. The civil and criminal actions were consolidated. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and found that defendant had breached the agreement. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court held that Ariz. R. Crim. P. 26.7 had no application to the hearing on defendant's motion to compel. However, there was no reversible error in the manner in which the hearing was conducted. The court noted that at the all parties called witnesses and cross-examined adverse witnesses and that the determination that defendant had failed to comply with the plea agreement was not determined unilaterally by the government officers. Moreover, at the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court determined by a preponderance of competent evidence that defendant had breached the cooperation clause of the plea agreement. Regarding defendant's sentences, the court noted that they were within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court convicted defendant of 30 counts of various crimes. The court affirmed 13 convictions and reversed and remanded his convictions for unlawfully acting as a real property securities dealer under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-2066.03, sale of real property securities for which no permit had been obtained under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-2066.08, failure to sign, deliver and retain a lawfully required real property securities statement under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-2066.04, and fraudulent advertising and failing to file advertising or sales literature under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-2066.05. The grand jury transcripts sufficiently informed him of the charges as they included testimony regarding each violation. Each transaction under &sect; 44-2066.03 and &sect; 44-2066.08 was a separate offense. Defendant could be charged in one count for violating two elements of &sect; 44-2066.04 because the requirement to retain copies was not an added offense. The state's motion in limine was consistent with a jury instruction requiring general intent. A jury instruction, however, made a guilty verdict possible without the commission of a crime when conspiracy was listed among offenses sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34-324(A) charged the commission with setting a prevailing rate of per diem wages, which contractors on state public works projects had to pay their employees. A corporation and others filed a complaint in which they alleged that the statute was an illegal delegation of legislative power to labor unions to determine wage rates. The trial court held that the statute's second sentence, which stated that under certain circumstances the commission had to adopt the wage rates fixed by private labor contracts as the prevailing wage scale, was unconstitutional. The court reversed and held that the both sentences of the statute were unconstitutional. The court rejected the commission's argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the legislature's action in establishing a method for fixing the prevailing wage rate. The statute was clearly subject to judicial scrutiny; the court had jurisdiction to determine whether the method chosen by the legislature complied with constitutional requirements. The statute as a whole went too far in requiring public authorities to accept wage rates fixed by labor unions without having the right to determine their reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city court rendered a judgment of conviction against defendant for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DWI). The city court imposed a 60-day sentence against defendant pursuant to the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-691.01B. Defendant filed an appeal, and the trial court affirmed the city court's judgment of conviction and sentence. Defendant filed another appeal. In this appeal, defendant argued that he was denied equal protection of the laws when the city court imposed a 60-day sentence for a person who has been convicted twice within a 24 month period of a DWI offense pursuant to &sect; 28-691.01B. The court did not find any merit in this contention. The court found the classification imposed by &sect; 28-692.01B was not arbitrary and had a rational basis for the distinction between those drivers who had a recent DWI conviction and those who did not have such conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment below permanently enjoined the contractor from excavating sand and gravel without first obtaining a permit. The court reversed that judgment. The issue in the case, the court found, turned on the meaning of the exemption for existing uses under the Floodplain Management Act (Act) and Ordinance No. 1974-86, &sect; 1002(5)(B) (1974) (Ordinance), which arguably required a permit to continue an existing use only if the exemption was inapplicable. Because the floodplain board could impose conditions on the issuance of a permit and thereby regulate the use, the permit requirements of the Act and ordinance potentially affected the contractor's use. The court found that the word, &quot;affect,&quot; in the Ordinance had its ordinary meaning, thus, if the evidence at trial showed that the contractor was diverting, retarding, or obstructing waters in the water-course and that such conduct created a hazard to life or property, it was then necessary to obtain a permit to continue that use. The court found that this raised a factual question and, therefore, the court reversed the permanent injunction and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the sale of heroin. He was placed on probation.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the trial court correctly found that it had no discretion pursuant to &sect; 36-1002.02(E) to determine whether defendant's probation should be revoked. The court ruled that the mandatory revocation requirement of &sect; 36-1002.02(E) did not violate defendant's right to due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile court adjudicated defendant delinquent for committing the offense of shoplifting and ordered her placed in the custody of the state corrections department for the term that was permitted by law. Defendant contended on appeal that she was charged with the wrong offense and that the state's indeterminate sentencing scheme for juveniles was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the juvenile court's judgment. The court concluded that the evidence supported a charge of shoplifting under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-673 and that the State did not need to charge the greater offense of completed theft under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-661. The court found that the length of time that the juvenile might remain under the control of the state corrections department was indeterminate and that the indeterminate sentence was a salutary requirement of rehabilitation. The court determined that it was not a denial of equal protection of the law to commit defendant for a period of time that was longer than the maximum period for an adult who was found guilty of shoplifting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The girl initially concealed the sexual intercourse but eventually said that she had been raped. At trial, defendant sought to introduce evidence of the girl's venereal disease as evidence that the girl's story of the rape was designed to hide from her mother the fact that she had contracted venereal disease from sexual intercourse with her boyfriend. The trial court refused to admit the evidence of the girl's venereal warts. Defendant was convicted of the girl's second-degree rape. On appeal, the court affirmed. The evidence of the venereal warts was not admissible because defendant did not make an offer of proof, there was no Pope hearing, and there was no showing that the mother did not know of the girl's sexual activities with her boyfriend. The trial court did not err by denying defendant two continuances because defendant was not prejudiced. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's decision to designate his offense as a felony because the trial court could designate the offense a misdemeanor upon defendant's completion of probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of fleeing a law enforcement vehicle in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-622.01. Defendant appealed the conviction, arguing that the state failed to prove that the police vehicle was marked as such as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-624, and thus the state failed to prove all the elements of the crime charged. The court held that there was no evidence of the marking of the police vehicle involved. Pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-622.01, an official law enforcement vehicle must have been operated in the manner prescribed in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-622.01 in order for a conviction of unlawful flight from a pursuing law enforcement vehicle to stand.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-624(C) required that a law enforcement vehicle was required to have been appropriately marked showing it to have been an official law enforcement vehicle. The court rejected the State's argument that a pursuing vehicle was appropriately marked so as to show that it was an official law enforcement vehicle when it was a police vehicle equipped with a radio, blinking red lights and a revolving yellow light, a siren, and flashing headlights.</SPAN></P>

Defendants claimed that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-374 was both overbroad and vague. The court disagreed. The court held that the statute provided persons of ordinary intelligence adequate notice of the proscribed conduct. The critical words of the statute were &quot;willfully disturbs a public school or school meeting.&quot; The court further held that the statute was not overbroad because it narrowly and clearly limited the kind of place in which the proscribed conduct was prohibited. The words &quot;public school&quot; meant institutions consisting of buildings, ground, and classrooms maintained by local governmental authorities for educational activities. Expressive activity ceased to be protected when it materially interfered with or substantially disrupted the normal operation of schools, school activities, or the rights of other persons.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1041, which provided that the interest of the legal owner of a vehicle in which a narcotic drug was unlawfully possessed shall be forfeited to the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner contended that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that marijuana was in fact a narcotic drug within the meaning of &sect; 36-1041. The court held that the State did not have such burden of proof because the legislature had already defined marijuana as a narcotic drug under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1001(14). The owner then argued that the classification of marijuana as a narcotic drug violated the equal protection clauses of the Arizona and United States Constitutions because marijuana was not scientifically, medically or pharmacologically classified as a narcotic drug. The court noted that the Arizona Supreme Court had considered the issue and upheld the classification, and the court had no authority to overrule that decision. The court said that in upholding the classification, the Supreme Court reasoned that the fact that a drug on a list of &quot;narcotic drugs&quot; might have been less harmful than those listed as dangerous drugs did not make the classification unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The automobile owner appealed the forfeiture of his automobile after his conviction for simple possession of marijuana. There was no evidence or even a contention that the marijuana found in the vehicle was intended for sale or for any use other than personal consumption. The court affirmed the conviction and noted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1041 did not require evidence of intent to sell. The Arizona statute expressly allowed forfeiture of an automobile in which drugs were kept, deposited, or concealed, or in which a narcotic was unlawfully possessed by an occupant. The court also held that the statute was constitutional. There was no lack of due process and given the scope of the statute, forfeiture was related to the statute's legitimate purpose and was not unduly oppressive. The equal protection argument was also rejected because the separate classification and treatment of drivers as opposed to pedestrians who possessed drugs had a rational basis. The double jeopardy argument had been rejected in prior case law. The forfeiture did not violate the plea agreement in the criminal possession case because the plea agreement expressly reserved the right to pursue forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was refused registration of his vehicle when he tried to register it without having secured a certificate of emissions inspection. Defendant was later convicted of driving with an expired registration. The superior court affirmed the conviction and held that the inspection statute was constitutional. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the legislation was a valid exercise of the police power to the end that air polluting activities of every type could have been regulated to insure the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens, and to protect property values, plant, and animal life. The court would not question the wisdom of legislative enactments unless they were clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or wholly unwarranted. The vehicle emissions test did not fall within the Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable searches because the intrusion represented by the emissions test, in contrast to the important government interest involved, was minimal, there was no search of the interior of the vehicle or its contents, and the test was administered at a time selected by the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner ex-wife and respondent ex-husband both sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which awarded all the property acquired during the marriage to the ex-husband and awarded spousal maintenance to the ex-wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a divorce case, the evidence showed the couple married in China in 1923 and lived apart for years. In 1946, the ex-husband was told that his wife was dead and he later remarried. The ex-husband claimed that the woman who brought the divorce petition in the 1970s was not his real wife but was instead her sister. An advisory jury found that the woman was not an imposter. The trial court awarded spousal maintenance, attorneys' fees, and costs to the ex-wife, but awarded all property to the ex-husband on a theory of estoppel, giving the ex-wife no share of the community property. Both parties sought review. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court reversed the decision to award all community property to the husband and held that the property acquired prior to the ex-husband's remarriage was acquired while a &quot;will to union&quot; existed and the division of such property was therefore required to be substantially equal. The court remanded the case for a redistribution of the property acquired before the husband's second marriage and a corresponding recalculation of the spousal maintenance award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding that the couple was married and awarding attorneys' fees and costs, reversed in part the award of all community property to the husband, and remanded the case for a redetermination of the property distribution and award of spousal support.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) granted judgment for the corporation. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county purported to acquire the disputed strip of land in 1949 pursuant to Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 59-601 (1939). The corporation purchased the lot in 1959. After more than 10 years had passed, the corporation sought to quiet title to the strip under a theory of adverse possession. The city, which had succeeded to the county's interest, appealed the trial court's decision in favor of the corporation. The county's purported acquisition of the strip of land did not meet the requirements of Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17 as that provision was interpreted by the Arizona Supreme Court in 1957. Because the county's purported acquisition was invalid, the corporation's predecessors retained title to the strip of land from at least 1957. Although the city argued that a public road had been created on the strip and that the corporation could not acquire title to a public road by adverse possession, the court disagreed and found that, in the absence of passage of title to the public, the road was not a public road. Sufficient evidence sustained the trial court's judgment that the corporation had used the strip as a parking area under the mistaken belief that the strip was part of its lot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that had quieted title to a strip of land in the corporation in the corporation's action against the city, the county, and its predecessors in interest to determine the land's ownership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which convicted him of first-degree burglary. After the jury found him guilty of the substantive offense, the question of the prior convictions was submitted to the trial court and it found the allegations of three prior convictions were true. A sentence of not less than 10 nor more than 12 years was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During defendant's trial for first degree burglary, one of the 12 jurors was reading a magazine while one of the witnesses was testifying. Defense counsel moved that the court strike the juror for cause. He and the prosecutor then stipulated, in defendant's presence, to proceed with 11 jurors. On appeal, defendant argued that the requirement of 12 jurors could not be waived and that, in any event, there was no intelligent waiver because the trial court did not inform him that he had a right to a mistrial. The court concluded that because defendant could waive a trial by jury without violating his constitutional right to a jury trial, the statute allowing the case to be tried by less than the number of jurors specified in the constitution did not constitute a constitutional violation. However, with regard to defendant's admission of prior convictions, the trial court did not comply with either Ariz. R. Crim. P. 17.2 or 17.6 by informing defendant of the range of possible sentence he would be subjecting himself to if the court found that the allegations of the priors were true. Accordingly, the sentence was set aside for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed as to defendant's conviction, but set aside defendant's conviction and remanded for an evidentiary hearing as to defendant's knowledge of the possible effect that his admission of the prior convictions would have upon his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possessing a stolen car. He appealed that conviction, but the court affirmed. The court first held that, during defendant's trial, the trial court properly admitted a transcript of witness testimony given during the preliminary hearing. The prosecution had adequately demonstrated that, after the witness had given his preliminary hearing testimony, he suffered significant health problems, including a stroke, and became unavailable to testify during the trial. Moreover, the use of the transcript did not deny defendant his right to confrontation because defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the preliminary hearing. The court next held that the search of another vehicle that police believed to be stolen was valid, and therefore defendant's arrest, which resulted from evidence obtained during that search, was also valid. Consequently, certain statements made by defendant at the time of his arrest were properly admitted. Finally, the court held that the grand jury proceedings contained no defect, and the trial jury was properly instructed on the elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Shortly before a private towing company was to take the motorcycle to its storage yard, a police officer removed a small package that was strapped to the rear portion of the motorcycle seat. Hashish was in the package. Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a narcotic drug, hashish. As a result, his probation and sentence from an earlier case were revoked. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that the classification of hashish as a narcotic drug did not deny him equal protection of the laws. The court also held that the hashish was legally seized incident to an inventory search. The court reasoned that the police officer was permitted to search areas of the motorcycle wherein valuables were most likely to be placed as part of the inventory search. The court found no error in the trial court's failure to exclude the motorcycle registration from evidence. Further, the prosecutor's statements made during his closing argument were not prejudicial and did not require reversal.

The commission found that he had suffered a 30 percent disability and awarded permanent benefits based on a 34.81 percent reduction in earning capacity. He was laid off with the other employees when the mine closed. The mine was the principal industry and its closure was economically catastrophic to the area. Shortly afterwards, he petitioned for rearrangement under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1044(F)(2), claiming total loss of earning capacity. The court held that the commission's award denying rearrangement had to be affirmed. He was undisputably disabled and returned to a lower-paying job. But he received an award based on diminished earning capacity. When the mine closed he made only limited efforts to find employment. There was no evidence that he was ever refused a job because of his disability. He failed to meet his burden of proving that his disability limited his earning capacity even more after the closure. The hearing officer concluded that he was not entitled to have bonus contract payments considered as a part of his monthly wage. The court agreed. The award was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-281.01 was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) the definition of &quot;improper influence&quot; in &sect; 13-281(4), which expressly stated that the influence must &quot;interfere with the exercise of free will or discretion,&quot; adequately set out an element of coercion not present in lawful contacts with officials; (2) the statute did not proscribe all statements concerning influence of a public official, but only claims or representations of improper influence made with the intent to procure something of value in return; and (3) the first amendment was not a shield for criminal activity which had been thwarted at an early stage.</SPAN></P>

They asserted that the trial court erred in finding no claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The electricians initiated an action on a payment bond, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34-223, against defendants seeking to recover damages because they were paid less than the prevailing hourly wage established by the Industrial Commission of Arizona for journeymen electricians. They also asserted a claim as third-party beneficiaries under the construction contract. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief, and the electricians appealed. The court reversed. It held that the electricians' complaint alleging that they were employed as journeymen electricians and were paid less than the prevailing wage for work of that classification stated a claim for relief. The fact that a certified copy of the wage rates was not attached to the contract documents was not fatal to the complaint. The statutory wages were incorporated by reference as the minimum to be paid. The court further held that the claim for relief as third-party beneficiaries was sufficient. It was not affected by a contract provision requiring an architect to decide issues concerning the execution and progress of the work or the interpretation of the contract documents.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the factual basis for the guilty plea, the constitutionality of &sect; 13-320.01, the sentence imposed, and an inconsistency in the record as to the amount of his fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to a charge of obtaining money pursuant to a fraudulent scheme or artifice, and he was fined and sentenced to a prison term.

The court affirmed the conviction and remanded the issue of the fine for clarification. In its ruling, the court found that there was an adequate basis in the record for the plea. Although defendant did not have a previous record, the court found that the superior court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing defendant to a five to ten-year sentence from a statutory maximum of 20 years. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 13-320.01 was unconstitutionally vague because of its use of the words &quot;scheme or artifice to defraud.&quot; The court reasoned that a person of average intelligence would understand that a &quot;scheme to defraud&quot; was a plan or decision to defraud, and that an &quot;artifice to defraud&quot; was an &quot;evil or artful strategy to defraud.&quot; Accordingly, a &quot;scheme&quot; or &quot;artifice&quot; to defraud was to form some plan, device, or trick to perpetrate the fraud upon another.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of altering public records, embezzling public funds, and filing a false Arizona income tax return. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the Arizona attorney general was authorized to prosecute this criminal matter under a written agreement with the county attorney that satisfied Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of a judgment entered in a trial court (Arizona) granting defendant's motion to dismiss a charge of theft by embezzlement in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-682 because &sect; 13-682 was violative of the equal protection clause of the United States and Arizona constitutions. The State claimed that &sect; 13-682 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-682(d)(4) discriminated against the poor in that it permitted a person with money to buy an affirmative defense because it afforded people who had the money to pay a lessor under a lease agreement after returning property to a lessor within 72 hours of the commencement of prosecution but that the defense was not available to one without money. The court vacated the order of dismissal. To expose a person to punishment solely because he could not pay the charges for an overdue period to rental property within 72 hours of the commencement of the prosecution would be tantamount to imprisonment for debt, which was violative of the constitutional prohibition of imprisonment for debt; therefore, &sect; 13-682(D)(4) did not pass constitutional muster. However, the court found that &sect; 13-682 was valid by severing &sect; 13-682(D). Section 13-682(B) placed the burden of proof on defendant to go forward with evidence peculiarly within his knowledge to prove his state of mind when leased property was not returned. It was not an undue hardship for defendant to have to rebut the presumption that the failure to return leased property was evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant sought to obtain certification in the state as a psychologist. The board denied him certification on the ground that his academic training was inadequate under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 32-2071, 32-2072. The trial court affirmed the denial. Upon review, the court reversed and directed a new judgment be entered granting the applicant certification. The court held that &sect;&sect; 32-2071, 32-2072 were unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous because a person of average intelligence would be unable to determine what was required to obtain certification under the statutes that provided for two avenues of certification. The court found the statutes did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the board by giving the board the power to define programs that were &quot;primarily psychological&quot; and which were &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; where it was a proper administrative function to give terminology meaning and definition as the details were peculiarly with the expertise of the board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was arrested for possessing stolen property.

At the detention hearing, no evidence was presented as to the alleged delinquent act. The referee denied the juvenile's request for a probable cause hearing and that bail be fixed in a reasonable amount. The juvenile court found that it was not required to hold a probable cause hearing or set bond. On appeal, the court denied relief because the question became moot as to the juvenile, but it assumed jurisdiction to answer it as one of statewide concern that was likely to recur. The court held that pre-trial detention of juveniles without determination of probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment. Because no factual materials sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the juvenile had committed an offense were presented by sworn statement or otherwise, the state failed to establish a prima facie case of probable cause to detain and the juvenile's request for a probable cause hearing should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the denial of the motion to suppress on the ground that the police officer had no probable cause to search her suitcases. The State argued that probable cause was based on the profile of defendant. Rejecting this argument, the court stated that the profile, which consisted of purchasing a one-way ticket to New York late in the evening approximately 15 minutes prior to departure with a heavy suitcase, was not sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable prudence to believe that an offense had been or was being committed. The officer's actions of squeezing defendant's suitcase and reaching inside and removing a portion of the contents before seizing the bag or making any arrest was an intrusion into a protected area. Wholly apart from whether there was an unreasonable search before the luggage was seized, the court stated that there was an unreasonable search after the seizure. The police forced the locks and opened the suitcases for examination. The search was without a warrant and the bags were then in police custody. There was no showing that the search was the product of exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and the court reversed the decision of the trial court and dismissed the indictment. The court held that the criminal sanctions of &sect; 44-1219 did not apply to defendant because his legal relationship to the removed property was that of a stockholder in a corporation, which owned and encumbered property. Defendant was neither a person who had mortgaged personal property to another nor one who had possession of personal property under a contract of sale whereby the vendor retained title. Defendant was not the person who created the lien or mortgaged the property. Instead, the corporation undertook that action prior to the time defendant became a stockholder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to ch. 160, &sect; 6, which amended Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20-224(B), the State imposed a tax upon the insurers covering premiums received from policyholders whose mailing addresses were in states or foreign countries in which the insurers were not licensed and did not have resident agents. The insurers challenged the tax, which was upheld in an administrative hearing. On appeal of the summary judgment in favor of the State by the superior court, the insurers asserted that pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 13, they should not have been required to pay the taxes because nothing in the title of the legislative act warned the insurers that they would have been subject to the tax. The court agreed that nothing in the title gave notice that a new tax on so-called &quot;orphan premiums&quot; was going to be imposed under the act. The only reference to premium taxes was &quot;Prescribing Date for Paying Premium Taxes.&quot; Contrary to the State's argument, the insurers were not required to show prejudice but only that the title did not give adequate notice that the content of the act imposed an additional tax obligation on domestic insurers. The court held the act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Registrar of Contractor of the State of Arizona sought review of a judgment of a superior court (Arizona), which declared that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1154(8) was unconstitutional and reinstated appellee contractor's license. The contractor had appealed a decision of the Registrar to revoke his license pursuant to &sect; 32-1154(8) after he had declared bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed that the statutory provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1154(8) were in conflict with federal law, rendering them constitutionally infirm under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The court found that the clear import of &sect; 32-1154(8) was to revoke a contractor's state license to conduct business if his debts were discharged in bankruptcy for less than the full amount. Furthermore, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1161(B) provided that once a license was revoked under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1154, it was not to be reissued for one year and then only after all loss caused by the act for which the license was revoked (bankruptcy) had been fully satisfied. The court held that the effect of this statutory scheme was to frustrate the objectives of the Bankruptcy Act in three respects. First, it tended to discourage a licensed contractor from seeking bankruptcy relief. Second, once a contractor was declared bankrupt his contractor's license could be revoked, depriving him of his livelihood. Third, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1161(B) compelled the bankrupt contractor to fully repay business debts otherwise legally discharged if his contractor's license was to be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of commercially exhibiting obscene items in the form of four films. Defendant challenged his conviction on several grounds. First, he contended that Ariz. Rev.

The court rejected this argument, finding that the concept of contemporary community standards had long been upheld against attack for uncertainty. Defendant also contended that the films were not obscene as a matter of law. The court found that the jury could have found that the depictions were patently offensive and that each of the films, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The court considered the overall character of each of the films and particularly the soporifically monotonous concentration on sexual activity, and found that the jury was not bound to accept the conclusion of defendant's expert witnesses that the films had serious scientific value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court entered a decree dissolving the husband's marriage and requiring him to pay monthly child support to his former wife for the support for the parties' four minor children. The wife subsequently caused a writ of garnishment to be issued to the husband's employer. The husband filed a motion to quash the writ of garnishment on the ground that the decree providing for monthly child support payments was not a &quot;judgment&quot; that would support the garnishment proceedings. The superior court denied the motion, and the husband brought a special action for relief, contending that due process required that he be afforded an opportunity for a hearing prior to the garnishment of his wages. The court held that the superior court did not err in denying the husband's motion to quash because garnishment was an appropriate means for enforcing the child support provisions of the divorce decree without notice and opportunity for hearing. The court found that, notwithstanding that the divorce decree could be modified or defenses to its payment could arise, the husband had already had a hearing at which it was judicially determined that he had an obligation to pay child support.</SPAN></P>

The employee requested a hearing before the Commission, and although his attorney was present at the hearing, the employee did not personally appear. The carrier did not waive his presence. The Commission dismissed the employee's claim, and the court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that Ariz. R. Civ.

The court also ruled that Ariz. R. Civ. P. 49 did not violate the equal protection clauses in U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ariz.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for armed robbery, the unlawful wearing of a mask, and assault with a deadly weapon, found guilty by a jury of all three charges, and sentenced to serve not less than five and a half years nor more than six years in state prison on the charge of armed robbery with a gun. Concurrent sentences on the other charges were also imposed. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-249(B) and 13-643(B), which required that a person committing assault or robbery while armed with a gun serve the minimum sentence imposed. The court held that the mandatory prison sentence prescribed by the Arizona Legislature was not an unconstitutional invasion of the judicial domain because the Legislature had properly exercised its power to prohibit suspension of a sentence as an inherent part of its power to prescribe punishment for the acts which it had prohibited as criminal. The court found that probation was a matter of legislative grace and that the superior courts of the state, absent legislative authority, had no authority to grant probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of choking the victim by putting his hand around her neck. A preliminary hearing was held, and the case was scheduled for trial. Defendant entered into the plea agreement. The trial judge held a hearing and examined defendant in compliance with Ariz. R. Crim. P. 17.2. The trial judge accepted the plea and sentenced defendant. On appeal, defendant challenged his conviction on the basis that the trial judge had failed to enumerate the requisite element of intent for aggravated assault prior to the acceptance of his plea. The court held that neither state jurisprudence nor decisions from the United State Supreme Court required that defendant be advised of the specific legal elements of the crime to which he entered the plea. Even if recent federal jurisprudence required the enumeration of the intent element of the charge, the decision was entered after defendant's conviction and was not retroactive in effect. Retroactive application of the alleged rule would have a seriously deleterious effect on the administration of justice. The court modified the conviction order because it contained a non-prejudicial technical error in the transcript entry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to October 1970, the county assessor did not value partially constructed buildings for property tax purposes. In October 1970, the Department's Director issued a directive, which required the valuation and taxation of all partially completed buildings by January 1, 1971. The taxpayers paid the tax under protest and filed an action to recover them. The trial court entered a judgment for the taxpayers. On appeal, the court held that the assessment of partially completed buildings was clearly within the intent of Arizona law. However, the trial testimony of county assessors established that, due to time and staff limitations, they made no effort to value all partial completions, but focused instead on the larger construction projects. This intentional plan for assessment of partial completions resulted in the vast majority of partial completions being omitted from the 1971 tax rolls. Further, assessing all partial completions the following year would not cure this discrimination. Thus, the taxing of the taxpayer's property violated the Uniformity Clause of the Arizona Constitution, Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1, and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stored motor vehicles and junk in his yard, and he was charged with violating the Ordinance by conducting a non-permitted use and by maintaining a non-permitted and non-accessory use. He was acquitted of conducting a non-permitted use, but he was convicted of the remaining charge. His conviction was affirmed on appeal to the superior court, and he appealed. The court reversed, holding that, taken as a whole, the Ordinance, with its express allowance of accessory uses, did not meet the test of defining an offense in a manner understandable by the average man. It required a resident to speculate as to whether his use of his property was in violation of the criminal law. To be valid, an ordinance creating an offense had to specify with reasonable certainty the conduct which was commended or prohibited. The necessarily indefinite concept of &quot;accessory use&quot; infected the validity of the Ordinance as the basis of criminal liability because of the infinite variety of uses that a residential landowner might make of his property. However, nothing restricted the City from pursuing civil remedies against persons it believed were maintaining non-permitted uses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by a trial court (Arizona) for aggravated battery under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-245(A). On appeal he argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and that &sect; 13-245(A) was unconstitutionally vague. The State raised questions as to whether aggravated battery was a lesser included offense of sodomy and whether defendant consented to altering the charging document under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 13.5(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a preliminary hearing, defendant was charged by information of committing sodomy with a fellow prisoner, a violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-651. Defendant waived a jury trial and submitted the case to the trial judge based on the transcript of the preliminary hearing. The trial court found him guilty of aggravated battery, and the court affirmed. Although aggravated battery was not a lesser included offense of sodomy, and the original information had not been amended, there were references to a &quot;stipulation&quot; in the transcript, and the court found sufficient evidence of consent by defendant to have permitted an amendment under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 13.5(b), although it did not approve of the trial judge's procedure in failing to put the agreement in the record. As to defendant's claims, the court found that the evidence substantially supported a conviction for aggravated battery. The court also rejected the argument that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-245 became overbroad and vague when applied to the facts of the instant case. It gave fair notice of the conduct it prohibited and was not so broad that its sanctions applied to conduct that the State was not entitled to regulate.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss the charges against him, alleging that the scienter requirement made the statute unconstitutional because he was required to censor himself. The court rejected defendant's contention and affirmed the conviction. The court stated that defendant had to be shown to have knowledge of the contents of the materials. Scienter was a requisite element of a criminal prosecution for sale of obscene materials and &quot;knowingly&quot; meant knowledge of the obscene nature of the materials involved. When a defendant was put on general notice of the character of the publication, the statute placed upon him the affirmative duty to inquire further. The court stated that the de novo review of a city court conviction provided by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-374(A) complied with the right to a criminal appeal guaranteed by Ariz.

The crime and the elements comprising it were expressly set forth, and a reasonable person would not be left to speculate as to the type of activity prohibited. The court found that defendant's words were not protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I free speech provisions. The court affirmed the decision that defendant was not entitled to a Bill of Particulars because the preliminary hearing transcript provided him with sufficient information to prepare his defense. The trial judge did not deny defendant the right to self-representation because he merely informed defendant that the trial procedure and law would be the same.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of a trial court (Arizona), which revoked his probation on an aggravated battery conviction and accepted his plea of no contest to robbery.

VIII and Arizona Const. art. 2, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to serve not less than five nor more than 10 years in the Arizona State Prison on the robbery charge, with a concurrent three to four year sentence for aggravated battery. Defendant was a 23-year-old man who was mildly mentally retarded, possessing an I.Q. of 61 and the reading skills of a beginning first-grader. Defendant, however, did not claim that he did not understand the wrongfulness of his actions. Instead, he alleged that prison was an inappropriate placement for him. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no abuse of discretion. The court held that the sentences were within the permissible ranges and thus did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court did not have the luxury of choosing one prison over another, and it was entitled to deny defendant a supervised program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The municipality granted to a property owner a special use permit allowing the construction of a hotel in a residential area. The permit provided that it would expire if construction was not completed within two years of issuance. In reliance on the issuance of the permit, the investors acquired interests in the property and expended substantial funds making preparations to begin construction. When the economy entered into a recession, the investors requested an extension, but the municipality refused. The investors claimed that the municipality's refusal to grant an extension was unconstitutional. The municipality claimed that it was improper for the lower court to order it to grant the extension. The court held that the injunction ordering the grant of an extension was proper. The court ruled that (1) the investors had a vested right to build under the permit and had relied on the permit to their detriment; (2) the municipality's refusal to grant an extension was arbitrary and violated the investors' due process rights; and (3) the investors were not entitled to an award of costs because they failed to file a statement of costs within ten days.</SPAN></P>

He argued that a mistrial was improperly ordered by the trial judge and his second trial violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy; that the evidence was insufficient to support a jury finding that the stolen property was valued at $ 100 or more; and that underscoring by the trial court of certain jury instructions was misleading and denied defendant due process of law. Defendant further argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-621(A) was unconstitutional because it violated due process of law, violated equal protection of the law, and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that defendant overlooked the fact that the mistrial was granted on the grounds urged by defendant. Having sought the mistrial, there was no error in retrying the case. Regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, the court noted that question of value was one for the jury to resolve, and there was no error by the trial court. Regarding the jury instruction, there was no objection to it, thus it was waived. Finally, the court sustained the constitutionality of &sect; 13-621(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, state and county taxing authorities, appealed two consolidated decisions of the Maricopa County Superior Court (Arizona), which granted real property tax refunds to plaintiff taxpayer for the years 1971 and 1972. The trial court held that the taxpayer was subjected to discriminatory real property tax assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Property near the taxpayer's properties was assessed at $ 6.00 per square foot up to a depth of 200 to 300 feet, with the remaining rear portions of the property valued at $ 3.50 per square foot. The state taxing authority assessed the taxpayer's parcels at $ 6.00 per square foot. The trial court ruled that the taxpayer was entitled to tax refunds because that portion of the property located more than 200 feet back should have been assessed at $ 3.50 per square foot rather than at $ 6.00 per square foot. The court reversed on appeal, finding that the taxpayer did not show discrimination. Instead, the court found that the nearby properties had undeveloped land in the rear or parking facilities in the rear. The taxpayer had a high-rise business complex in the rear. The court found that the taxing authorities used standard appraisal methods in determining the full cash value of the subject properties pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-123.01(A)(5), including market data. Thus, the court held that the taxpayer did not carry its burden of proof in proving the assessments were the result of an intentional, systematic over-valuation.</SPAN></P>

She resided at the address, the police came at a time when she was likely to be home, she previously avoided the police, and defendant acted suspiciously when police arrived. It was the officers' right and duty to inspect the house for the roommate. Once inside the home, they observed the marijuana in plain view and properly seized it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that their convictions should be reversed because Ariz. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13-631, 13-631.01 were vague and overbroad and therefore unconstitutional. Defendants also argued that the evidence did not support the verdict. The evidence established that a bus containing about 30 to 40 pickets belonging to the labor union proceeded to a lemon grove. About 15 workers were in the grove picking lemons. When the bus stopped, the pickets alighted from the bus, following defendants, their apparent leaders. On their way into the grove, the pickets apparently picked up rocks and sticks and threw them at workers standing near the grove. There was also evidence that one defendant physically assaulted a work foreman at the grove and that the pickets pushed a police officer from the entrance of their bus in order to board after retreating from the grove. The court affirmed the judgments of conviction because a &quot;riot&quot; was a public disturbance involving an act or acts of violence by one or more persons who were part of an assemblage of three or more persons. The court held that a fair construction of the &quot;riot&quot; statute made it clear that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, Department of Property Valuation determined the full cash value of property of appellee Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement &amp; Power District. The Project appealed the Department's valuation to the Board of Property Tax Appeals. The Board reduced the valuation made by the Department. The Department appealed to the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which granted the Project summary judgment. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Project was not subject to State ad valorem taxes. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-2201 et seq., the Project made voluntary contributions in lieu of the ad valorem taxes. The Project argued that in view of the statutory presumption, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-152(B), of the correctness of the Board's valuation determination, there were no material issues of disputed fact. Because the valuations found by the Board were within 10 percent of those set by the Department, the trial court felt compelled to find that the Department's evidence did not overcome the presumption and that the Board's determination had to be affirmed. The court reversed, finding that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment based on the statutory presumption. The Department's affidavits from three qualified appraisers, all of which exceeded the valuation found by the Board, were sufficient to overcome the presumption of fact that the Board decision was correct and at least precluded the granting of summary judgment based upon the statutory presumption alone. The statutory presumption merely gave rise to a burden of proof requirement. The procedure was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from a trial court (Arizona), which convicted him following a jury trial of two counts of credit card forgery in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1074 and one count of possession of a stolen credit card in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1073. He was sentenced to four to five years' imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently as of the date of his arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attempted to purchase items at a department store using a stolen credit card. He selected goods at two separate departments of the store, offered the stolen credit card, and then signed the name of true cardholder. He claimed that the title to S.B. 1267, which amended Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1073, did not comply with the &quot;one subject&quot; provision of the Arizona Constitution, Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 13. The court rejected this argument and upheld the judgment. First, even though the bill contained a provision making it illegal to possess a credit card with intent to defraud that was not expressly recited in the title, the provision in no way conflicted with the bill's title and was clearly germane to the subject of the original statute. Second, because the evidence did not raise a question as to the voluntariness of defendant's statements to police, the trial judge was not required sua sponte to enter into an examination outside the presence of the jury to determine the possible involuntariness of the statements. Finally, defendant's conviction of both possession and forgery of a credit card did not subject him to double punishment under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1641.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, taxpayers and easement owner, filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment as to the rights of defendant city to construct a series of roadways and rights to prescriptive easements. The City filed a motion to dismiss under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state whether the action was brought by individuals or as a class action. An Arizona trial court granted the city's motion. The taxpayers and easement owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers contended that the city's acts were illegal and unconstitutional by wanting to put a roadway system through a recreation area and by not appropriately using tax dollars. The easement owner claimed that the roadway system would interfere with the easements and sought to quiet title. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayers' claims. The court held that the taxpayers failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The city was not prohibited from establishing roads through city owned recreational areas. Thus, the city had the authority to provide an adequate public roadway system for the use and benefit of the city's inhabitants by passing an ordinance creating such a road system. However, the court reversed the dismissal of the easement owner's claim. If the easement owner had certain prescriptive rights under the mandatory truth assumption, then he had standing and was entitled to have his case heard on the merits. Although the claim could have been pleaded with greater clarity, a motion for a more definite statement under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(e) would more appropriately have cleared any deficiency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Arizona State Liquor Board, challenged a judgment of a trial court (Arizona), entered in favor of appellee resident alien in the resident alien's appeal of an order of the Board denying his application for issuance of a spirituous liquor license in reliance upon Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-202(A), which required the applicant have been a citizen of Arizona. The trial court held the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the Board asserted that the Equal Protection Clause did not apply to the state's power to regulate the sale of liquor, and that &sect; 4-202(A) was necessary and proper to protect the interests of Arizona's citizenry. The Board also argued that the state's police power in this area was not limited by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the term &quot;person&quot; in the Fourteenth Amendment included resident aliens and entitled them to equal protection. The classification based on alienage invoked a strict standard of review. Although Arizona could regulate the licensing of liquor applicants, the qualifications had to have a rational connection with the applicant's fitness to hold the license. Section 4-202(A) was invidiously discriminatory and arbitrarily foreclosed to resident aliens the right to pursue an otherwise lawful occupation. The Board failed to present any legitimate or compelling state purpose to justify the discrimination. Citizenship could not have been a prerequisite for obtaining a liquor license because it did not reflect a compelling state interest. The court declared &sect; 4-202(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's counsel waived his presence during the re-reading of portions of the testimony to the jury after they had begun their deliberation. After the jury convicted him, and while his appeal from that conviction was pending, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 32. Defendant's court-appointed counsel waived the grounds set forth in defendant's pro per petition and relied solely on the violation of defendant's right to be present and the unconstitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted. The trial court vacated defendant's conviction and granted a new trial. The court denied the state's request for relief. To prove that defendant had waived his right to be present, the state had to show that defendant had given counsel express authority in a knowing and intelligent manner, or that defendant was present at the time of the waiver and had clearly been informed of his rights and remained silent, or that defendant subsequently acquiesced in the proceedings in a knowing and intelligent manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtor claimed that the prejudgment writ of attachment on his land was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment that refused to quash such writ because the attachment procedure did not affect a significant property interest of the debtor's in the land. Indeed, the prejudgment attachment procedure was constitutionally indistinguishable from the effect of the mechanics' and materialman's lien procedure, which procedure had been declared constitutional by the United States Supreme Court. Specifically, like the filing of a mechanics' and materialman's lien, the writ of attachment did not deprive the debtor of the right to possess, use, enjoy, or sell his land. At most, it rendered the selling of the land difficult. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which held, as moot, the issue of the validity of the prejudgment writ of garnishment. The court further ordered the trial court to dissolve such writ because the debtor was a member of a class, which had, in a separate action, obtained an order enjoining the issuance of writs of garnishment on personal property except upon compliance with certain procedural requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order, which, in an action brought by the debtor against the creditor to recover on a promissory note, denied the debtor's motion to quash a pre-judgment writ of attachment obtained by the creditor.

Moreover, the advertisements and the brochure fell within the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-2101(24)(h).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner employee sought review of a decision of respondent Industrial Commission of Arizona, which found in favor of respondents employer and carrier, awarding the employee workmen's compensation benefits based upon an 11 percent hearing loss in his left ear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was employed as a machinist with the employer. While hammering lugs on a large tire rim, the employee hit the rim and developed a loud roaring noise in his head. The employee filed a claim for workmen's compensation for marked loss of hearing in the left ear. When his doctor discharged him from further treatment, he rated the employee's permanent impairment as an 11 percent hearing loss, although he testified that, but for the binding nature of the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (Guides), he was of the opinion that the employee actually suffered a greater loss of hearing. The carrier awarded the employee compensation for the partial loss. The employee sought a hearing, claiming he had a greater disability than awarded. The Commission held against the employee. The court held that where a rule requiring the exclusive use of the Guides would make it impossible for the Commission to make the award it was required to make pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1044 in the instant case, the rule as applied by the hearing officer was in excess of the statutory rule making grant to the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with armed kidnapping and committing a lewd and lascivious act in an unnatural manner. The trial court convicted defendant. On appeal, defendant contended that Ariz. Rev.

The court held that: (1) the Supreme Court of Arizona had recently held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-652, which prohibited the commission of lewd and lascivious acts in an unnatural manner, was constitutional; and (2) there was no error in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence because the evidence was seized as the result of a search incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to serve a term of not less than three nor more than five years in prison, and the sentence was to run concurrently with the sentence defendant had received for an earlier armed robbery conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss he made before the case was submitted to the trial court for judgment. Upon review, the court found defendant's argument without merit. Defendant argued in part that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-393 was unconstitutional, being violative of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. Considering the gravity of the offense charged, coupled with the fact that the trial court was able to review defendant's record and the circumstances of the case before setting bond, there was no abuse of discretion in setting the bond at $ 5,500. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-393 met the required constitutional test. It had a reasonable basis and did not discriminate between classes of people and therefore is not violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ward was adjudicated an incapacitated person and was not competent to make an application for admission to the state hospital. With the guardian's consent, all administrative procedures were accomplished to place the ward in a state hospital. The guardian notified the duly appointed guardian ad litem, who successfully enjoined the guardian's placement of the ward without the ward's consent. The superior court found that, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-518(b), the placement of the ward without his consent was a denial of due process of law. In his petition for special action, the guardian contended that he was entitled to commit the ward to a mental health institution without the ward's consent. The court disagreed and denied the guardian relief. The court held that &sect; 36-518 did not authorize a &quot;voluntary admission&quot; by the guardian of an incapacitated person and that resort to the statutory procedure for involuntary commitment was required. The court looked to the laws of Pennsylvania and California regarding the admission of minors or the wards of conservators into hospitals or other facilities.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of dismissing the case. The issues on appeal were the constitutionality of the statute of limitations and whether there were genuine issues of material fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the patient was operated upon for gallstones, a hemostat or steel surgical clamp was left within the patient's abdomen. The patient didn't discover the presence of the clamp for nine years, although the patient had experienced pain, almost every day, after the date of the original operation. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-542(B) provided a six-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice. On appeal, the court reversed the summary judgment entry dismissing the patient's case. The case was remanded. The statute of limitations did not deny the patient due process of law even though the limitation barred her claim without her being aware that she had been injured. Nor did the statute deprive the patient of the equal protection of the law, as guaranteed by Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 13 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, when the classification of health providers was reasonable and supported by a rational basis. However, whether the statute of limitations was tolled was a question of fact that should have been tried. Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker and his wife drove truck for an employer, which was insured by the insurer. The worker and his wife were involved in an accident while working. This resulted in the wife's death and the worker suffered injuries. The worker sought to recover workmen's compensation payments for his injury and also sought death benefits for his wife's death. The insurer denied both claims but the Commission ordered payment of both claims after finding the worker was an employee and that the worker was dependent on his deceased wife. On appeal, the court affirmed and found the employee finding supported where the worker used the employer's equipment and was prevented from working for any other source. As to the dependency issue the court found Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1064(A)(2), which provides that a husband is conclusively presumed to be totally dependent upon a wife whom he has not voluntarily abandoned at the time of the injury, constitutional. The court held that the irrebutable presumption of dependency clearly had a relation to a legitimate legislative goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Attorney General of the State of Arizona, sought review of a judgment by a trial court (Arizona) in favor of appellees, a county supervisor, a planning and zoning commissioner, and residents, in an action by appellees for declaratory relief challenging residency requirements of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-803(B) (Supp. 1975). On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court held that a portion of &sect; 11-803(B) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees contended that the residency requirements of &sect; 11-803(B), which limited the number of city residents eligible for appointment to the Pima County Planning and Zoning Commission, infringed on the rights to vote and to be eligible for appointive office. The trial court held that a portion of &sect; 11-803(B) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 13. On appeal, the Attorney General contended that the challenged portion of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-803(B) was constitutional. Appellees argued that &sect; 11-803(B) violated the one person-one vote rule by disenfranchising certain persons on local issues. The court determined that the one person-one vote rule was inapplicable because the Commission's functions were wholly nonlegislative. Additionally, the court held that the right to be eligible for appointive office was not a fundamental right deserving strict scrutiny. Under the rational basis test, the court determined that insuring that the concerns of residents were felt by the Commission's members was a legitimate interest sought to be furthered by &sect; 11-803(B) and was reasonably related to the effectuation of such interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">According to the testimony of defendant's daughter and son, defendant forced his daughter to engage in sexual intercourse and performed acts of cunnilingus with her. Defendant was arrested, and he made statements during his interrogation that were admitted into evidence at trial. At trial, magazines that depicted sexual conduct, which were recovered in defendant's bedroom, were admitted into evidence. The court held that, because there was conflicting testimony on whether defendant requested an attorney after being informed of his rights, there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's determination that no request had been made, which precluded the court from reversing the finding. The court found that, in light of evidence that defendant had shown sexual pictures to his daughter in order to assure her that the sexual activity was right, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to allow the magazines and pictures to be admitted as evidence against defendant. Finally, the court determined that Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ariz. St. Bd. Of Property Tax Appeals Equalization Order No. 5 (July 16, 1973) set forth a method of valuing property that applied a factor to the full cash value of various land use classification codes that involved sales ratio studies. The owners claimed that the Order violated Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, providing for uniform taxes upon the same class of property within territorial limits of a levying authority, and of the Equal Protection Clause. At trial, the court voided the Order with respect to property designated as duplexes, apartments, condominiums, and townhouses, but not to other property types. On review, the court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-143 (1971) specifically did not prescribe the rules and methods by which the Board was to arrive at full cash value and gave the Board broad discretion, which it did not abuse by using certain property classifications and methods; that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-144 did not provide for notice of a general increase or review to individual owners; that the owners did not meet the burden of showing systematic and intentionally unfair conduct by the Board; and that the owners did not show bad faith on the part of the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the trial court (Arizona), defendant pleaded no contest to the charge of committing lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under the age of 15 years. Defendant later challenged his conviction, raising three issues, whether: (1) the record contained a factual basis for the plea; (2) Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-652 (Supp. 1973) was overbroad on its face and constitutionally void; and (3) &sect; 13-652 (Supp. 1973) was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found a factual basis for the plea. The victim, a nine-year-old boy, testified that defendant performed acts of fellatio and anal copulation with him. Two other witnesses testified that they saw the acts. The trial court specifically informed defendant that he had the right to go to trial. Defendant accepted that there was sufficient evidence to convict him of the charge. As for &sect; 13-652 being overbroad because it could be applied to infringe on First Amendment rights, the court found that despite another court division's finding that the statute under which defendant was prosecuted was unconstitutional, even assuming that the statute could be unconstitutional as applied to adults, the alleged unconstitutional portion of the statute could be severed from the portion relating to acts performed upon children. The valid section of the statute pertaining to children was not intimately connected to the alleged invalid section and was operative as law independent of that section. Section 13-652 was valid when applied to acts involving minor children. Finally, because defendant's acts were clearly prohibited, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever counts of the indictment regarding the first victim from counts regarding the second victim. Defendant also asserted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-652, a statute involving a lewd and lascivious act, was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed defendant's conviction in part and reversed it in part. For both victims, defendant used his car to pick them up. Both times he initially purported to take the victims to places they wished to go, but then changed direction and headed for the same desert location. In both cases defendant forced his victims to submit by physical violence. In both cases defendant drove his victims back to Tucson instead of leaving them in the desert. The similarities were in aspects where one would normally have expected to find differences. The evidence of both incidents were admissible in separate trials under the common scheme or plan exception. The trial court accordingly did not abuse its discretion in holding that severance was unnecessary to promote a fair determination of guilt or innocence. As for &sect; 13-652, it was violative of the right of privacy and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the director was terminated by the superior court, he brought an action contending that he was wrongfully terminated and challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 25-381.06.

The court held that &sect; 25-381.06, which vested the superior court with authority to appoint and terminate directors of conciliation, was constitutional. Section 25-381.06 was not required to delineate standards or procedures for termination because it gave the superior court complete discretion to take away what it gave. The court also held that the director was not denied due process of law in being terminated without a hearing because &sect; 25-381.06 created no constitutionally protected property interest in job expectancy. In addition, the protection of the director's good name, reputation, and honor was not at issue where the superior court brought no charge against him. The court further determined that the director was not denied equal protection rights because there was a rational basis for classifying the position of director of conciliation where his duties required him to have a good relationship with the conciliation court judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother was having emotional difficulties and agreed to place her child in a foster home. The department of economic security (D.E.S.) urged the mother to improve her circumstances and provide a home for the child. The evidence showed that the mother made some progress toward the goal. After the child was in a foster home for more than a year, D.E.S. sought the termination of the mother's parental rights under &sect; 8-533, which the juvenile court ordered. The mother sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the juvenile court's decision. The court concluded that severance of the mother-child relationship was premature because the evidence showed that she was making some effort to provide for a more stable environment. The court found that the mother had not been given an opportunity to demonstrate her willingness or ability to provide a good home for her child. The court also held that the desire to place the child in a stable, adoptive home was not the controlling criterion in the proceeding.

The court first determined that defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes, which prohibited consenting adults from engaging in the behaviors, despite the evidence the acts were preformed without consent, because this was a situation where a denial of standing would impair the rights of third parties who had o effective way to preserve their rights. The court then concluded that the constitutional right to privacy developed by the United States Supreme Court was not restricted only to married couples.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners claimed that notice to them announcing the hearing on the establishment of county improvement districts was constitutionally insufficient. They concluded that the establishment of the district actually constituted a &quot;taking&quot; of their property, and due process required that the affected parties receive personal, rather than posted or published, notice prior thereto. The court found that the role of the board was not at all ministerial; rather, it had full discretion, within the standards set by the legislature in Ariz. Rev.

Thus, the process of seeking to have an improvement district formed is essentially political and had all the attributes of any legislative petitioning.

The landowners had an opportunity at the hearing on the assessment to make challenges to the creation of the district, which they claimed should have been made at the hearing on the petition.

Stat. &sect; 12-1123(B) (&sect; 12-1123(B)) to the extent it denied them interest on the $ 10,1000 before the money actually became available for withdrawal. The appellate court modified the trial court's judgment by disallowing all interest on the $ 10,100 and affirmed the judgment as so modified. Any error concerning the remittitur was in the city's favor. The landowners were entitled to erosion damages for improper construction of the drainage way. The landowners could constitutionally be required to forego interest pursuant to a stipulation and &sect; 12-1123(B).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of driving a motorcycle without a helmet in violation of &sect; 28-964A. He appealed, contending that &sect; 28-964A was unconstitutional because it violated the due process clause as it was not a valid exercise of the state's police power. Defendant argued that the state's police power did not extend to overcoming the right of an individual to incur risks that only involved himself. The court affirmed, holding that there was valid state interest in requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets, so the statute was a valid extension of police power. The public had an interest in minimizing the resources directly involved because of motorcycle accidents. Any accident on the public highway put into motion the wheels of a number of different state and local agencies at a substantial cost to the taxpayers. From the moment of an injury, society removed the person from the highway, delivered him to a municipal hospital and municipal doctors, provided him with unemployment compensation if, after recovery, he could not replace his lost job, and, if the injury caused permanent disability, it might assume the responsibility for his and his family's continued subsistence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow filed a claim for benefits that was denied by the employer's insurance carriers. The commission, however, held the claim compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act, but not compensable under the Occupational Disease Disability Act. On review, the court set aside the award. There was no conflict with a doctor's testimony establishing the relationship between the death from lung cancer and the worker's employment in the employer's mines. The court determined that it had to set aside the award because the worker had died prior to a change in the law. The court concluded that it was unfortunate that the worker died before the changes became effective and the widow, therefore, was left with no right to obtain compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act where others who died after the changes took effect could have been eligible to receive compensation under the revised laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State passed a general appropriation bill that required appropriations under the &quot;Capital Outlay Stabilization Fund&quot; and the &quot;Operating Reserve.&quot; The taxpayer contended that the appropriations were unconstitutional and maintained that they should have been removed from the calculations of the state tax rate. It paid the taxes under protest. The State contended that the taxpayer did not alleged that the tax levy set by the State Tax Commission was so grossly excessive as to be arbitrary or fraudulent, and thus, failed to state a cause of action. Upon review, the court found that the Commission had the duty of fixing the rate of the levy. Thus, even if the Commission acted on incorrect figures supplied by the legislature, if the taxpayer failed to show that the tax rate was so excessive as to be arbitrary or fraudulent, the action had to fail. Although the court found the result illogical because the Commission's function in setting the levy was a ministerial rather than a discretionary function, it was bound to follow the Supreme Court of Arizona's precedent.

The motion was taken under advisement. The matter proceeded to trial. Defendant was convicted of both counts. He renewed his motion to dismiss. The trial court granted the motion. The state sought review. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that Arizona could not constitutionally criminalize consenting sexual behavior carried on by a married couple in private. The court further held that because of a compelling state interest in protecting its citizens from violence, Arizona could constitutionally enact a statute which made it a crime for a husband to sexually assault his wife.

Debtor A never contested the validity of the writs. Various other creditors of debtor A asserted claims against debtor A funds being held by debtor B. Debtor B sought court determination of the rights and priorities of the claimants. The supply company was made a party to the action. The supply company asserted a new claim against debtor A funds being held by debtor B and served a post-judgment writ of garnishment on debtor B. The court affirmed. The creditors were justified in relying upon the constitutionality of Arizona's statutes allowing prejudgment writs of garnishment not involving wages. Their priority rights vested when the writs were served. A subsequent determination of unconstitutionality of the Arizona statutes allowing prejudgment writs of garnishment did not render the creditors' writs invalid. Debtor A did not timely urge the defense of unconstitutionality. The supply company had no standing to raise that defense in an attempt to retroactively divest the creditors of their vested priority status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on his guilty plea. The sentencing court concluded that under Ariz. Rev.

Defendant claimed that the conflict was irreconcilable and that the sentencing court should have considered probation as a sentencing alternative. The court considered the legislative intent and the context of the statute and disagreed, finding that (1) the 1975 legislative clarification reflected the legislative intent behind the 1974 amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-643; (2) the legislature intended that any person convicted of robbery while armed with a gun had to be incarcerated for a prescribed period of time; and (3) the trial court properly construed the statute by harmonizing apparently inconsistent provisions.

The carrier denied both claims. A hearing officer agreed that she was not entitled to widow benefits because she was not married to decedent but that they she had been living with the decedent for many years and had been dependent on him for support. However, the Commission subsequently determined that the claimant could not recover benefits under &sect; 23-1046(A)(8), a catchall provision for &quot;other&quot; dependents, because the provision had been declared to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority for lack of sufficient guidelines. On petition for writ of certiorari, the court affirmed, concluding that the claimant did not have a vested property interest in the prior award because all that had been determined was that she had a dependency status.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee individual brought an action, protesting the front end assessment. The trial court held that the title to Chapter 127, Senate Bill 283, was violative of Ariz. Const. art. 4, Part 2, &sect; 13. On appeal, the court reversed the determination by the trial court that the title at issue was constitutionally defective. Otherwise, the court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court found that, while the main thrust of the title was the formation of a county improvement district, the financing necessary to accomplish the formation was germane to and properly included within the title. The sole reason a district was formed was to accomplish a specified improvement. It was difficult to conceive that the matter of assessment, which was the means of paying for the improvement, was somehow foreign to the concept of formation.The court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the title failed to put an interested party on adequate notice of the contents of the bill and therefore the court held the title to be constitutionally sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Defendant confronted a police detective and allegedly grabbed the front of the officer's pants and, while holding on to the pants and the officer's private parts, attempted to pull him into a booth. The officer arrested and charged defendant with a violation of &sect; 23-65. Defendant contended that two phrases in &sect; 23-65 were so vague as to render it unconstitutional. The phrases were &quot;grossly indecent&quot; and &quot;which outrages decency and is injurious to or tends to corrupt morals.&quot; The court affirmed the decision of the superior court. It held that &sect; 23-65 merely encompassed the notion that certain types of conduct were considered unacceptable by the public and were treated as criminal acts. &quot;Indecent&quot; as used in &sect; 23-65 was well defined and was not subject to the objection of vagueness.

The court on appeal set aside the Commission's award based on its determination that, because most families regularly and normally required each parent to participate in income generation, the dependents in families were totally reliant upon the income generated by each working spouse as they worked concurrently at their jobs. The court, therefore, determined that the language of &sect; 23-2045.A.2. was required to be construed to mean that dependents were &quot;totally dependent&quot; upon each working parent at the same time as if each were solely responsible for generating the entire family income.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted for a violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-672, theft of a motor vehicle. His motion to suppress was granted because the profile used by the police officers to stop vehicles on the road did not constitute reasonable suspicious circumstances justifying a stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's automobile was stopped because it matched a profile of probable cars stolen by persons in a particular age group for transport to Mexico. After being stopped, defendant told the officers that he had stolen the truck. At issue was whether law enforcement agents could stop an automobile to check its registration and the license of its driver without any indication that a statute was violated and whether the stolen motor vehicle profile arm a law enforcement officer with reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct to justify the stopping of an automobile. The court held that the profile used by the officers did not constitute reasonably suspicious circumstances justifying a stop. The profile was not meant to provide reasonable suspicion that a vehicle was stolen; it was only developed to show that if a vehicle was stolen, it would be transported to Mexico. The court also held that the record was devoid of any evidence of the profile's accuracy. The court also found that the profile was overbroad. Additionally, the court found that the stolen motor vehicle profile required too much exercise of independent judgment on the part of the law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the mandatory retirement age in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-1471 did not constitute invidious discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the equal protection clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county issued a property tax assessment against the coal company for its mining operations on Native American Reservations in the county. The company paid the tax under protest and filed an action to recover the monies paid. The trial court granted the company's motion for summary judgment, stating that there was no statutory authority for the tax assessment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the mine was leased to the company pursuant to 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 396a. Under the lease, the company undoubtedly had some interest in the property but that interest was not tantamount to fee ownership. Thus, the company's interest was incapable of being taxed as a fee interest. The intention of the legislature not to tax leasehold interests was clear. Consequently, the court was unable to read Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-124 A as authorizing taxation upon the leasehold interest of the company. There being no statutory authority for the tax, the assessment was improperly levied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was living with the mother, his eight brothers and sisters, and his mother's husband when the adults were charged with aggravated assault on the child. The child was placed in the custody and control of the Pima County, Arizona Department of Public Welfare. Over the next three years attempts were made to return the child to the home, but additional assaults on the child caused the Department to file a petition that sought to terminate parental rights. The juvenile court granted the State's petition, and the mother appealed. The court affirmed. There was substantial evidence that supported the juvenile court's determination, and evidence by a preponderance was the appropriate burden of proof where the competing interests of the parent and the child had to be considered. Evidence of improper methods of discipline and unexplained injuries to the child strongly supported the court's finding that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the action of the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured on the job, and he was admitted to the employer's hospital facility for treatment by the employer's physician. The employee was referred to the employer's surgeon, who found no evidence of hernias. The employee then visited a private surgeon without the employer's consent, and the private surgeon recommended surgery for hernias. The employee was scheduled for surgery at the employer's hospital for hernia repair by the employer's surgeon. However, he requested a change of physician to his private surgeon because he had no faith in the employer's surgeon. Surgery was performed by the private surgeon, and the Commission subsequently granted the employee's request for a change of physician. However, following a hearing in which a hearing officer denied the request for a change, the Commission affirmed the denial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the employer was not required to pay for the surgery. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1070(E) (Supp. 1974), a change of physician was not warranted. There was no evidence to support the employee's claim that his health, life, or recovery was jeopardized by lack of confidence in the employer's surgeon.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-371A(4) in that she maliciously and wilfully disturbed the peace and quiet of the people at the airport by violent, abusive, obscene epithets to another. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction. The court believed that the Arizona Supreme Court had narrowed the interpretation of &sect; 13-371 to make it fall within the accepted guidelines of the United States Supreme Court decisions and that the narrowed interpretation freed the statute from any constitutional infirmity. The Arizona Supreme Court narrowed the definition of &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; through &quot;offensive&quot; conduct to mean wilfully and maliciously inciting others to violence or engaging in conduct likely to incite others to violence. The conduct of defendant was likely to incite others to violence. The utterances by defendant were not an essential part of the exposition of ideas and were of such slight social value that any benefit derived from them was clearly outweighed by the social interest in peaceful and nonoffensive conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher was in her third year in a probationary teaching position when she received written notice from the superintendent of the non-renewal of her contract for the following year. The notice specified dissatisfaction with her teaching performance. At the teacher's request, the board afforded her a hearing. The board upheld the superintendent's decision. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-254, which applied to continuing teachers, provided that there had to have been &quot;good and just cause&quot; for the non-renewal of a contract. The notice of dismissal in the case of probationary teachers did not have to specify the time, place, or circumstances of the conduct that was detrimental to a teacher's efficiency. There was no evidence that the non-renewal of the teacher's contract was for an unconstitutionally permissible reason. The teacher had no right to a hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurers challenged the constitutionality of the Arizona Insurance Guaranty Act. The trial court found that the Act was constitutional because of its manifest intent in that it fulfilled a necessary public purpose. The insurers appealed. The specifics of the statute in conjunction with the inferential controls of the statute as a whole, combined with its relationship to other statutes, created a proper delegation of authority and, thus, was not violative of the separation of powers of the state constitution. The court also found no violation of the due process clause of the federal constitution and its guarantee of equal protection. Upon careful scrutiny the court could not find that the classification failed to exhibit a rational relationship to the accomplishment of a legitimate legislative goal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was convicted of two felonies, drawing checks on an insufficient account and fraud. While on parole, she was given employment as a statistical typist by the Auditor General; prior to that employment she had not been questioned as to her criminal record. Her performance for the Auditor General was exemplary. However, she was dismissed from her position without notice or the opportunity to be heard on the matter. The sole reason alleged for her dismissal was her prior felony conviction. On the instant appeal, the court held that by her discharge the employee was not prohibited from seeking employment with other offices in the state government system which might not be as sensitive to her particular conviction and thus no property right of hers had been infringed by the dismissal. As no constitutionally impermissible reason had been alleged for the employee's dismissal, her constitutional argument that her discharge amounted to a denial of due process and equal protection of the laws failed. The Auditor General possessed the power under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1279.02 to dismiss the employee at his will, and his exercise of that power was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time the parents purchased their lot in a mobile home subdivision, the lot was subject to a recorded restrictive covenant. The covenant provided that the subdivision was restricted to persons 21 years of age and older. The parents lived on their lot with two children under 21 years of age. The owners sought enforcement of the restrictive covenant. The trial court enjoined the parents' further violation of the covenant and awarded attorneys' fees to the owners. The court affirmed the trial court's order enjoining further violations of the covenant and held that from the covenant's language, construed in the popular sense, and the circumstances of its use, to provide an adult community, it was self-evident the that the covenant prohibited persons under 21 years of age from residing in the subdivision. Further, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-303 was inapplicable because it only applied to rental situations. Moreover, the restriction was reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of providing adult living for older buyers. Finally, the court held that the award of attorneys' fees was improper because the covenant did not provide for the recovery of attorneys' fees by the owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's decision that enjoined further violations of a restrictive covenant, in favor of the owners. The court held it was error to award attorneys' fees to the owners and ordered the award of attorneys' fees deleted from the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion. The court held that: (1) the probate court had the power to deal with the property in question and the lack of written findings was not jurisdictional; (2) legal error on the part of the probate court in assigning part of the estate and not the whole estate, although cognizable on direct appeal, did not render the decree void and thus subject to collateral attack; and (3) the exclusion from the homestead exemption for certain debts on mobile homes and certain labor and material liens bore a reasonable relationship to the purpose of the law to protect a family against forced sale for debts that are not specifically related to the family home and thus the homestead exemption was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with maintaining pigpens within 300 feet of an inhabited house in violation of a county health department regulation. The trial court convicted defendant and, as a sentence, enjoined defendant from maintaining his pigpens in violation of the regulation. Defendant argued that the legislature had unconstitutionally delegated authority to an executive department, the county board of health, to enact the regulation, without sufficient standards, and that, therefore, the regulation was invalid. The court held that: (1) where a regulation on its face bore a rational relationship to the alleviation of the conditions that it sought to regulate and the regulation was within statutory bounds, the regulation could be deemed valid; (2) the maintaining of pigpens with their attendant possibility of unsanitary conditions provided a rational basis for keeping them segregated from proximity to human habitations; (3) the county health department could have a health nuisance enjoined by proceeding civilly for such relief; but (4) when it proceeded criminally against an alleged violator, it was limited in relief against that violator to that which was imposed by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, a driver and a car owner, filed a special action against respondents, a superior court and a judge, regarding the constitutional validity of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1101 et seq., and whether petitioners were afforded a constitutionally adequate hearing prior to the suspension of the driver's license and the owner's vehicle registration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner's car, while being operated by the driver, was involved in an accident. Petitioners had no insurance, so the Superintendent of the Motor Vehicle Division advised them of the proposed suspensions and advised them of their right to request a hearing before the Financial Responsibility Service. A hearing was requested, and a hearing officer determined that security deposit was required under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1142A. Petitioners filed a request with the superior court for a stay of the suspension orders pending a court hearing on their review petition. Their request was denied, and they filed the instant action. Upon consideration, the court remanded. The court determined that the Act was constitutionally valid as it provided for all the procedural requirements to comply with due process. However, because petitioners could have been denied the required due process based on allegations that they were unable to confront witnesses against them and were denied the right of compulsory process for witnesses, the court held that the superior court was required to make a determination of the statutory adequacy of the hearing prior to denying a stay of the suspensions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded petitioners' action to the superior court with directions to determine whether the statutory requirements for a hearing before the Financial Responsibility Service were complied with and to stay the suspension orders until the superior court had held a hearing on that issue. The court ordered that the stay continue in place if the statutory requirements were not met until a review hearing was held.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county's tax assessor utilized a cyclical revaluation plan to determine property values for the purpose of taxation. The cyclical plan provided for the revaluation of property every three years. The taxpayers challenged the plan, alleging that, because their revaluation occurred prior to that of other taxpayers, they were paying disproportionately higher taxes. The trial court granted summary judgment for the governmental entities. The trial court found that the county's cyclical revaluation plan was unconstitutional. However, the trial court denied any refund to the taxpayer, finding that any such refund would have worked a great and undue hardship on the governmental entities. The court held that judgment should have been entered in favor of the governmental entities. The court held that the county's cyclical revaluation plan did not involve intentional and arbitrary discrimination, and thus did not violate any of the taxpayers' constitutional rights. Under the resources realistically available to the tax assessor, the required property revaluation could not have been accomplished within one year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After two previous convictions for driving a vehicle while under the influence, defendant's driver's license was revoked.

Defendant alleged that he could not be convicted under &sect; 28-692.02 because the revocation of his license was based upon a conviction that occurred when he was not represented by counsel. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the civil revocation of a license under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692.01 could be based upon a conviction for driving while intoxicated obtained as a result of a proceeding in which defendant was not represented by counsel; (2) evidence obtained as a result of the breathalyzer test was admissible with or without the implied consent law, and the testimonial privilege guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments did not apply to chemical tests for intoxication; and (3) double jeopardy was not involved because Ariz.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial judge considered information from the corrections department regarding defendant's juvenile record, presentence reports, and his own recollection of his experience with defendant as a juvenile judge before he sentenced defendant. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contentions that &quot;fundamental fairness&quot; dictated that his juvenile records could not be reviewed before passing sentence upon him and that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-207(C) was unconstitutional. Precedent held that a sentencing court could, consistent with the Due Process Clause, consider out of court information relating to a convicted person's life and characteristics. Any lack of rights accorded to juvenile offenders was constitutionally irrelevant in determining whether conduct as a juvenile could serve as a basis of aggravating or mitigation his sentence as an adult. Although the records had been destroyed, other sources of evidence as to his experience in the juvenile justice system could be considered pursuant to &sect; 8-207(C).

The term &quot;loitering&quot; as used in &sect; 11-33 was not per se constitutionally vague, because it the context of the entire statute, the term &quot;loiter&quot; was clear and certain.

On appeal of defendants' involuntary manslaughter convictions and sentences, the court affirmed their convictions but reduced their sentences. The trial court did not err by refusing to suppress a medical encyclopedia that was seized from defendants' trailer because defense counsel failed to object promptly, as it sought to place before the jury the religiosity of the mother as shown by markers in the encyclopedia and other items found in the trailer. Even if the trial court erred by allowing a social worker to refer to the death of another child of defendants, it was harmless given the overwhelming evidence against defendants. The court found that defendants' sentences of not less than eight nor more than 10 years in prison were excessive, and reduced them to not less than one nor more than two years in prison. The pre-sentence reports concerning defendants did not recommend prison time given the immaturity and lack of education of the mother and the borderline intelligence of the father.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional, as the determination of what was a lethal weapon depended upon the manner in which it was used and not upon its capacity to produce death or great bodily harm.

Stat. &sect; 9-471, the statute under which the petition was brought, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that appellant lacked standing to raise the issue. The court did not need to decide the constitutionality of &sect; 9-471. First, the court expressed doubts as to whether appellant had a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. The stake which appellant asserted was receipt of a proportionately smaller share of the sales tax revenue that the state distributed to cities on the basis of population. Second, assuming that appellant had a stake, it failed to meet the other requisite of standing. Appellant failed to show that the interest sought to be protected by its complainant was arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee at issue. Appellant's interest in a few more tax dollars was not within the zone of interests protected by the First Amendment right to petition.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's conviction for the latter crime. The court held that defendant was subjected to double punishment contrary to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1641 because when all of the elements of burglary were eliminated there was no basis for charging defendant with having violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1580. More importantly, the court held that &sect; 13-1580 was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although this issue was not raised at trial, the court noted that defects affecting constitutional rights could be considered on appeal for the first time. Bail was a constitutionally protected right under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1580 treated persons on bail or recognizance differently from others. By singling out for punishment persons who exercised their right to bail &sect; 13-1580 operated to chill the assertion of constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The court did not consider these matters, but instead focused on the superior court's jurisdiction. Specifically, the court found that under Ariz. Rev.

The court further found that placing defendant on probation was the same as imposing a sentence.

Because there was no proof of the reasonableness of the fee that had the effect of curtailing First Amendment freedoms, the court held that the fee was unconstitutional. The publisher also challenged the trial court's ruling that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court held that no public policy required that state courts refuse to entertain 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action and therefore, the action was proper in state court.

She argued that the affidavit's facts did not establish probable cause and that the information did not state a public offense when it charged possession of a narcotic drug, a violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1002.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer's affidavit was the sole basis for issuing the warrant. There were four areas of knowledge, which included information leading to a prior search and arrest, information of her continued drug trafficking and drug use, information from a recent surveillance of her home, and information that supported the necessity of a no knock warrant. The court found that the prior search conducted four months ago was properly considered as evidence of a history of the presence of drugs on the premises, when it was combined with more recent evidence. The surveillance showed that several known drug offenders entered the premises. Two formerly reliable confidential informants also advised an officer that they had purchased drugs from defendant. The court read the affidavit as a whole and found that it presented sufficient information to establish probable cause. Count II was not fatally defective when it sufficiently charged the crime. Defendant stipulated that the drug Numorphan was a narcotic drug and this dispensed with the necessity of any other proof. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was classified as a &quot;private car company,&quot; under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-741 et seq. The corporation filed an action in the trial court for recovery of taxes paid under protest. In its action, the corporation alleged an additional ground for recovery not alleged in its protest. The trial court dismissed the action. The court reversed with directions for a trial on the merits. In so ruling, the court stated that the statutory protest requirements, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-124.02 and 42-146, were not applicable to the corporation at the time the taxes were paid. Giving retroactive application to the statutes, as amended, would have imposed additional liabilities upon the corporation. At the time the taxes were paid, the corporation had a common law right to sue to recover property taxes paid, as long as it specifically paid the taxes involuntarily under protest. The threat of loss of its property in order to satisfy a delinquent tax payment was sufficient to make the payment involuntary. Furthermore, the protest did not need to specify in detail each and every ground therefor, and a refund suit was not limited to the grounds set forth in the protest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The newspaper challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-213. The court had jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the trial court action appealed from a &quot;police court,&quot; because the action involved the validity of a statute. The court determined that the newspaper's conviction could not stand under the caselaw, mostly of recent vintage, which had generally invalidated abortion criminal statutes. Specifically, the United States Supreme Court had held that abortion statutes similar to those of the State of Arizona, codified at Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-211 through 13-213, were unconstitutional. The court noted that it was bound by the conclusions previously reached by the courts, most notably the United States Supreme Court. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment and found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-213 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In their motions to quash the indictments, defendants raised the issues of whether the indictments were definite enough to charge them with having committed a crime, and whether &sect; 13-440, as worded, created a continuing crime for which there could be only a one count prosecution. On appeal, the State raised the issues of whether phrasing a count in an indictment in the language of the applicable statute was sufficient to resist quashing the indictment, and whether &sect; 13-440 sanctioned only one continuing crime for which only one count for violating &sect; 13-440 could be charged, or whether multiple counts could be charged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution sought review of the trial court's judgment granting defendant's motion to quash his indictment charging three violations of &sect; 13-440 based on defendant's having taken separate bets on gaming events. Defendant contended the statutory language, &quot;engaged in the business,&quot; created a continuing crime for which there could be only a one-count prosecution, requiring the court to dismiss all three counts of his indictment for resubmission to the grand jury to render a one-count indictment. The court on appeal reversed the trial court's decision, concluding that (1) the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to quash his indictment because the language was constitutionally sufficient to apprise defendant of the charges against him, and the proper course should have been for the trial court to deny the motion to quash in connection with the correct related decision that was rendered to grant defendant's motion for a bill of particulars; and (2) the intent of the legislature was for the statutory language in &sect; 13-440 to provide that each betting incident would constitute a separate and distinct offense, thus allowing for defendant's prosecution on multiple counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a mayor and city council, sought review of the judgment of a trial court (Arizona), which held a redistricting ordinance, Tucson, Az., Ordinance No. 3959 (1972), unconstitutional after appellees, residents and a prospective candidate of the wards affected, brought two separate actions for declaratory judgment against the city to test the constitutionality of the redistricting. An accelerated appeal was brought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mayor and city council redistricted the city by adopting Ordinance No. 3959, which created new ward boundaries by equalizing on a ward basis. The city's charter provided that the terms for councilmen were staggered and the ordinance shifted approximately 46,500 people to new wards, thus causing them to lose their right to vote in an upcoming primary election. The trial court found the ordinance constitutional and on appeal, the court affirmed. The theory of the mayor and city council was that all they needed to show was that the one-man, one-vote principle was satisfied. The court, however, agreed with the position of the residents and candidate, which was that when there was a delay in the voting privileges for a large segment of the population, the city could not justify the result by merely showing achievement of population parity. Rather, they had to demonstrate a compelling state interest and that a less drastic solution was not available. The mayor and city council failed to demonstrate that the ordinance was necessary to promote a compelling state interest in the face of the temporary disenfranchisement of so many voters and an apparent less disruptive alternative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient sought review of the trial court's decision denying his release from treatment at the state mental health hospital. He contended that because he was found not guilty by reason of insanity that he had been denied due process of law by virtue of his commitment having been entered pursuant to &sect; 13-1621.01 rather than by its subsequent amendments in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-501 through 36-526, which were more liberal in allowing for patient release. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, concluding that the patient, having been tried and found not guilty by reason of insanity, came within a reasonable classification of persons who could be released from further hospitalization for his mental illness when it would be established in a jury trial that he was no longer a danger to himself or to others. The court found that the procedures available to the patient and if effect when he was tried were realistic, that they were based upon a reasonable classification, and that they did not deprive him of the due process of the law even though they differed from the procedures set forth in the amended laws.</SPAN></P>

The state and the city argued that the ordinances regulated conduct and not speech or expression. The court granted the waiters and waitresses the relief they sought, holding that the ordinances in question were invalid. However, the court found that the portions of Tucson, Ariz., City of Tucson Ordinance &sect;&sect; 11-25.1 and 11-25.3 which prescribed clothing requirements for those serving food and drink were constitutional. In support, the court reasoned that naked waiters and waitresses were not entitled to U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that the statutes were not vague and indefinite, overbroad, or otherwise in violation of the state or federal constitutions. The court found that there was a presumption of constitutionality, and appellees failed to overcome the presumption. The court ruled that, pursuant to common law, the statutes did not violate the right of personal privacy, did not constitute an establishment of religion, and did not discriminate against women of low economic status. Moreover, the state's interest in protecting the fetus was a sufficient state interest; therefore, the statutes were not an invalid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Members of the purported class could have experienced different treatment from that which the student experienced.

The court found that the statute did provide an adequate expression of a legislatively imposed standard as to the class of persons that were to be benefitted. However, the court stated that the statute was unconstitutional because it lacked statutory standards to guide the Commission in the exercise of its discretion in determining the amount and duration of awards as applied to unrelated dependents. The court concluded that the statute was also invalid on the ground that it was incomplete on its face in that it was an incomplete expression of legislative intent and it was incapable of administration without additions of legislative character.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in a magistrate's court with violation of Phoenix, Ariz., Code art. VIII, &sect; 2. That section provided that no person could keep a dog within the city limits if the dog was in the habit of barking or howling or disturbing the peace and quiet of any person within the city. Upon his conviction and fine, defendant appealed to the superior court, which affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed pursuant to the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-375, which questioned the constitutionality of the ordinance under which the municipal fine was imposed. The court affirmed. The court held that the use of the word &quot;habit&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague as being beyond the comprehension and understanding of a person of common intelligence. The court noted that it would be hard-pressed to find a word different from &quot;habit&quot; to express the prohibited conduct. The court found that, while the punitive language of a criminal statute should immediately follow the denouncement language, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-18(b) and Phoenix, Ariz., Code art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the taxpayer's action was subject to dismissal because the administrative remedies that led to the Ariz.

Stat. &sect; 42-152, which governed the trial court's hearing on the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-151 appeal, expressly limited the evidence that could be introduced and the findings that the trial court could make. Therefore, the court held that constitutional or legal issues not related to the factual determination of the correct classification or the correct &quot;full cash value&quot; valuation were not intended to be considered in the &sect; 42-151 appeal. The court held that the taxpayer was not entitled to the equitable relief requested. Instead, the court held that other statutes provided adequate remedies and held that the taxpayer had to utilize those remedies if it wished to question the legality, validity, or the amount of assessment against its properties. Finally, the court held that the taxpayer did not make the requisite strong showing to justify requiring the governing authorities to answer certain interrogatories.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The director valued the landowners' property, and the assessor changed one parcel's valuation. The assessments were adjusted by administrative appeal, but the landowners sought additional reduction through judicial review. The trial court upheld the assessment and valuation on one parcel but rejected the valuations and assessments made on the remaining parcels. The parties appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the legislature's delegation of the agricultural property guidelines was not an unconstitutional delegation of power because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-136 had classified property for tax purposes. The property classification based on use was permissible. Because the same valuation rules were applied throughout the state, there was no discrimination, and it was error for the trial court to overturn the assessment. The assessor had been correct that the cutoff date for property valuation changes had been met, and the trial court incorrectly reversed the assessment. The trial court properly upheld the assessment made by mass appraisal because it was a recognized standard technique that actually had undervalued the property.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and ruled that the son was not a dependent child as defined by &sect; 46-101 sub. 6 and was therefore not entitled to ADC benefits where the father did not qualify as an unemployed supporting parent because he made himself unavailable for employment based upon his desire to personally look after the son.</SPAN></P>

The legislative delegation of authority to determine whether the public service corporations were capable of providing power to the area had not been applied to appellants' disadvantage, and therefore appellants lacked standing to challenge the portion of &sect; 30-315 that allowed such a determination. Section 30-315 did not deprive appellants of any vested right to be a power district. On the contrary, appellants' right to be organized as a power district was subject to the contingency of a favorable vote at the polls.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, a non-profit family planning services corporation, a woman, and medical practitioners, filed a petition for extraordinary relief after the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) granted a motion to dismiss filed by respondents, an attorney general and a county attorney, in petitioners' declaratory judgment action alleging that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-211, -212, -213, pertaining to abortion, were void for unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents successfully moved the trial court to dismiss petitioners' declaratory judgment action on grounds that the complaint did not set forth a justiciable controversy. Petitioners sought extraordinary relief and contended that after the case was tried on the merits and submitted, the trial court dismissed the action ex mero motu without notice to the parties. Petitioners claimed that the dismissal was arbitrary and in excess of the trial court's jurisdiction because it was the trial court's duty to decide the case on the merits. The court found that even without a pregnant woman before the court, a genuine and justiciable controversy existed. In relation to qualified medical practitioners and the family planning corporation, the complaint had alleged a justiciable controversy. A declaratory judgment action was a proper remedy to test the validity of a criminal statute where it affected one's trade, business, or occupation. To require statutory violation and exposure to grave legal actions and to force parties down the path to prosecution divested them of the forewarning that the law, through the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, had promised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court directed the trial court to vacate the order of dismissal and proceed to a resolution of the case on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, the Employment Security Commission of Arizona (Commission), appealed from the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) judgment reversing the Commission's final decision to deny unemployment benefits to petitioner employee. The Commission argued that its decision was supported by the evidence, was not arbitrary and capricious, that its limit on attorney's fees did not deny due process, and that the lower court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was a union member dispatched by the union to a construction site. He was later terminated for failure to comply with required safety regulations, specifically for refusing to wear a &quot;hard hat&quot; due to his hearing. His unemployment claim was denied because his refusal reflected a wilful disregard of the employer's interests warranting disqualification from benefits under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-775(2) of the Employment Security Law. The lower court reversed this decision, finding that it was unsupported by the evidence. It further found that the employee was denied due process by the Commission's regulation limiting the fee an attorney could charge to appear before its appellate tribunal. The court reversed this judgment and reinstated the Commission's decision. The Commission's interpretation of the employee's action as &quot;misconduct&quot; disqualifying him from benefits was supported by sufficient evidence in the record. The court had no power to disturb that finding. There was no statutory requirement that an employer be a defendant in judicial review. The superior court had jurisdiction to hear the action. The agency's limiting fee regulation was not a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the superior court was reversed, and the decision of the Commission was reinstated. The court found that the record indicated sufficient evidence to support the finding of misconduct as the cause of the employee's unemployment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision by a trial court (Arizona), which entered a judgment of conviction on his plea of guilty to an amended information charging him with the offense of obtaining narcotics by fraud or deceit, a felony, and from a prison sentence of from one to three years imposed thereon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to the offense of obtaining narcotics by fraud or deceit. He subsequently challenged his conviction and sentence on the basis that the charging information did not state a public offense. The court reversed defendant's conviction. First, the court held that defendant was entitled to challenge his conviction even though he made no objection to the indictment because an indictment that failed to charge a public offense constituted a fundamental error. Second, the court held that the part of the statute under which defendant was charged was unconstitutionally vague. The statute in question, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1017 (1963) made it a public offense to obtain a narcotic by fraud or deceit. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1001 defined a narcotic drug as one designated as such by the Federal Narcotics Commissioner. The lists of drugs classified as narcotics by the federal government, the court found, referred to their actual chemical ingredients, not their trade names. Thus, &quot;Numorphan,&quot; which defendant was charged with illegally obtaining, was not listed. The court held that the statute did not properly apprise defendant of what was forbidden and what was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual was charged with violating Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-895, which, under &sect; 13-895(A) prohibited the use of obscene language to harass or threaten, and which, under &sect; 13-895(B), provided that the use of obscene language was prima facie evidence of intent to terrify or harass. In the individual's action challenging the statute's constitutionality, the trial court rejected the individual's claim that &sect; 13-895(A) was unconstitutionally vague. However, the trial court found &sect; 13-895(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the statute at issue was not an obscenity law and thus the complexities of the definition of obscene as applied in such laws was not at issue. The court held that the state had a legitimate justifiable interest in prohibiting harassment by such language under &sect; 13-895(A). Additionally, the court held that the use of the term &quot;profane&quot; in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. However, the court then held that obscene or profane language could be used without an intent to harass. Thus, the court held that &sect; 13-895(B) created an impermissible presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens alleged that the director was a member of the board, that the board was considering a petition filed by the director's company and that caused an impermissible conflict of interest pursuant to Arizona's conflict of interest statutes. The director did not deny the allegations, but sought to quash the complaint on the ground that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-503 was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court agreed and dismissed the complaint. The ruling was challenged by the instant special proceeding. The court set aside the dismissal order. The court held that it was clear that in order to guard against conduct of a public officer or employee potentially inimical to the public interest, the legislature deemed it necessary to give the term &quot;substantial interest&quot; a broad encompassing definition. Therefore, according to the legislative definition, any interest which did not fall within the seven classifications set out in &sect; 38-502(5) constituted a &quot;substantial interest.&quot; The court opined that the term referred to a pecuniary or proprietary interest, by which a person gained or loss something. In this case, the court found that the director had a pecuniary interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Arizona), which convicted him of the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The information alleged that defendant by wrongful and improper acts and conduct, wilfully and unlawfully encouraged and contributed to the delinquency of a named female child of 13 years, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-821, 13-822.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that &sect; 13-822, when the facts of the case were applied to it, became unconstitutionally vague and indefinite in that under the statute failed to give notice that kissing, touching, and offering a cigarette to the minor constituted acts which tended to injure or debase the health, morals, and welfare of a child. The court found that the constitutionality of &sect; 13-822 had already been established by the Arizona Supreme Court and that the statute was not vague nor indefinite. The court noted that the art of seduction was so variant and insidious, especially when applied to different individuals, that it was impossible, as a matter of law, to lay down any rule on the subject of what will or will not invariably tend to produce delinquency in all minors. The court further held that the trial court's failure to give jury instructions on the elements of the offense was not an error because proof of a specific intent to cause the child to have become delinquent was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indigent brought suit seeking an absolute divorce. The trial court concluded that in view of the indigency, the filing fee should be waived but further concluded that the trial court did not have authority to exempt petitioner from costs of service of publication and the services of a court reporter for a certified transcript. The indigent contended that the trial court's order denying her motion to waive costs of service by publication and the costs of the services of a court reporter constituted a failure to exercise discretion which the judge had a duty to exercise. The court held that a state rule or statute generally valid may be unconstitutional on its application to certain individuals when it deprived those individuals of protected rights, that the right to be heard must be protected against denial by particular laws that operate to jeopardize it for particular individuals, and that a cost requirement on its face, may offend due process because it operated to foreclose a particular opportunity to be heard.

The claimant filed a petition for a further hearing, which resulted in the entry of the prior award. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the claimant's affidavit of bias and prejudice of the hearing officer was inadequate in and of itself because it contained only a general allegation of bias. The court ruled that because the affidavit did not contain any statements to support the allegations, the hearing officer was correct in denying the petition of bias and prejudice even if he did so for the wrong reasons.
