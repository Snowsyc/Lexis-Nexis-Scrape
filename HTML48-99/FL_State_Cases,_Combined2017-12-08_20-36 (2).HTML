</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment by the trial court (Florida) convicting appellant of concealing intoxicating liquor on which no tax had been paid in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 562.32, contending that the statute contravened Fla. Const., &sect; 8 prohibiting excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 562.32&nbsp;unconstitutionally imposed excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment because fine and imprisonment could be imposed for failure to pay what appellant called a non-existent tax. Appellant argued that the state could not punish him for not paying a tax on what was commonly known as moonshine whiskey because it was impossible to pay such a tax. The court disagreed, finding that while it may have been impossible to pay a tax on moonshine, it was certainly possible to obey the law by simply manufacturing, removing, depositing, and concealing none of it. The court found that the gravamen of the statute was intent to defraud, which was proven by the state. The court found that the trial judge properly admitted evidence of the alcohol seized by police from appellant because due to appellant's driving conduct, his behavior in attempting to break a jug against the window when he was pulled over, and the fact that the jug was visibly dripping a liquid that could be smelled by the pursuers, there was a sound basis for belief by the officers that a felony was being committed in their presence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld appellant's conviction and held that the statute was not unconstitutional because while it may have been impossible to pay a tax on the alcohol possessed by appellant, appellant could have obeyed the law by refraining from manufacturing, removing, depositing, or concealing the alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida legislature passed 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 31178 to reapportion the membership of the state House of Representatives based on the 1950 census. Appellants filed suit, contending that the session law violated Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3, because the senate districts were not reapportioned at the same time. The trial court found that 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 31178 was constitutional, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed, finding that while Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3, required the reapportionment of senate and house districts every 10 years in order to make the districts as nearly equal in population as practical, the judicial branch was not authorized to compel the legislature to exercise a purely legislative function. Furthermore, the court did not find a requirement that required both legislative branches to reapportion the districts simultaneously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida, and intervenor former owners appealed from the lower court's (Florida) determination that dismissed without prejudice appellants' cross-complaints seeking to quiet title to lands lying outside the limits of an island, ostensibly owned by appellees, who filed cross-assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reviewed the lower court decision in appellee landowners' action against appellants, trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida and the City of Miami, to quiet title to land outside of an original five-acre grant of the island. The supreme court held that the Riparian Rights Acts of 1856 and 1921, Fla. Stat. ch. 271 (1951), were not applicable to and granted no rights to the grantees of sovereignty lands from appellant trustees. Therefore, appellees' predecessor in title had no right to fill in and bulkhead anything except the five-acre tract actually conveyed to him by appellant trustees. However, the court found that the doctrine of equitable estoppel was developed for the purpose of preventing such injustices as would result were the court to agree with the contentions of appellants. Appellants had acted for years under the assumption that it had no title to any part of the island. Accordingly, the court held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevented appellants from asserting their title to any of what currently constituted the island as against the title of appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of appellants' cross-complaints to quiet title was affirmed. Denial of appellees' request for a decree enabling him to further enlarge the island was reversed. Appellees' predecessor in title had no right to fill in and bulkhead anything except the five-acre tract actually conveyed by appellant trustees. However, equitable estoppel prevented appellant trustees from asserting title to the island as against the title of appellees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the order of the Circuit Court (Florida), which granted an injunction against appellants and permitted two trucking companies to intervene in the case in which appellee public utilities commission alleged that appellants owed mileage taxes under Fla. Stat. ch. 323. Appellants also objected to the court's use of a special master for purposes of taking the testimony of appellants' witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee public utilities commission filed complaints charging appellants, truck rental corporations, with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 323. Although appellants rented trucks pursuant to written leases, appellees claimed that the leases were a sham and that appellants actually furnished drivers, trucks, and other services which characterized them as auto transportation companies, which were subject to regulation under ch. 323. Appellees sought an injunction and an accounting for the purposes of payment of mileage taxes due the state. Appellants claimed that the trial court erred in granting intervention because intervenors, trucking companies, had no rights or claims in the litigation. Intervenors asserted that they were certificated common carriers and that appellants' activities were detrimental to intervenors because the activities directly reduced the amount of lawful carriage available to intervenors. The court held that there was no error in granting intervention under the circumstances. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and also concluded that special masters were allowed to be appointed to serve in a ministerial capacity to perform services for the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which found that the final decree that found that appellants were required to pay mileage taxes was supported by competent substantial evidence. The court held that it was sufficient that the trial court found that some of appellants' activities were illegal, and it was only such activities that were enjoined by the final decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surety company sought review of a judgment of forfeiture of a bail bond that was ordered without notice to appellant and without an opportunity for appellant to present its defenses. Appellant argued that such forfeiture was a denial of due process as was guaranteed by Florida law. The Supreme Court of Florida disagreed and affirmed, holding that a final judgment entered against a bondsman on forfeiture of the bond was not lacking in due process for lack of notice to the bondsman because appellant made itself a party to the cause by filing the bond as a part of the record therein. It was a fiction of the common law that the surety was personally in attendance upon the court whenever the accused, by order of the court, was bound to appear personally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, which forfeited appellant surety company's bail bond without notice, was affirmed; forfeiture was not a violation of due process because appellant had made itself a party to the cause by filing the bond as a part of the record therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the judgment of the trial court (Florida), which ruled that appellant's zoning dividing line constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of appellee landowner's property and enjoined the zoning dividing line.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city re-zoned appellee landowner's property and issued a certificate of compliance. The trial court enjoined appellant, finding, inter alia, an unconstitutional deprivation of property. The Supreme Court of Florida granted certiorari and reversed, concluding that it had long been a firmly established principle of zoning that the courts did not have the right nor the authority to substitute their judgment for that of the municipal legislative body which possessed the power and was charged with the duty of enacting zoning legislation where the question was fairly debatable. The court held that appellant had to create a dividing line between business and one-family residential districts and that appellant's choice in appellee's matter was a logical place for such a dividing line. Accordingly, deference was given to appellant under the &quot;fairly debatable&quot; rule of drawing diving lines, and the court opined that such decisions necessarily involved a degree of arbitrariness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, which enjoined appellant's zoning dividing line as purportedly unconstitutional, was reversed because, under the &quot;fairly debatable&quot; rule, deference for drawing zoning dividing lines was accorded to the municipalities, and the courts were not to substitute their judgments for that of the zoning authorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review of a judgment from a Florida trial court which ruled that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.39(3) was constitutional, in an underlying workmen's compensation claim filed by appellee worker, who himself sought review of a ruling that denied him attorney fees and interest under the statute for defending against appellant's position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee worker was awarded workmen's compensation payments. He sued appellee tortfeasor and eventually settled his case. Appellant insurer was the compensation carrier for appellee worker's employer. As such compensation carrier, appellant was brought into the case for the purpose of determining its &quot;pro rata share&quot; of the recovery pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.39(3), which provided for a lien in favor of the employer or compensation carrier for such share based upon the equitable distribution of the amount recovered. Appellant contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The court, relying on a previous opinion that addressed the constitutionality of the statute, disagreed and affirmed. The right to a &quot;pro rata share&quot; based upon &quot;equitable distribution&quot; was available to all compensation carriers under the statute; thus, there was no denial of equal protection. As well, the arguments of vagueness, indefiniteness, and unlawful delegation of legislative authority with respect to the statute had been discarded previously. The court denied appellee worker's cross-appeal which challenged the denial of his request for attorney fees and interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, determining that the workmen's compensation statute in question was constitutional and that appellee worker was not entitled to attorney fees and interest, was affirmed. Because the statute applied to all compensation carriers, the requirements of equal protection were met.</SPAN></P>

Appellants petitioned for an alternative writ and alleged that the applicable proviso was unconstitutional, and they were relegated to a broader statutory provision, which authorized the higher salary. The trial court sustained appellee's motion to quash the amended alternative writ. The appellate court affirmed and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 125.161 contained no severability clause. The court stated that the legislature would not have passed the statute without the 24 provisos, and that the provisos were conditions precedent to the ultimate approval of the bill that eventually became a law.

The special election to ratify the legislation creating the special tax district was amply publicized, and no one was misled in any way.

Laws ch. 30300, which provided that within certain population limits the budget of the county board of public instruction was only subject to the review and approval of the state superintendent of public instruction. Plaintiff, a county budget commission, claimed that act was a special law and attacked its constitutionality. The trial court declared the act unconstitutional. Defendant, a county board of public instruction, appealed. The court reversed the decree. Where a classification on a population basis was reasonably related to the purpose of a law, it was a general law, even if when enacted it effectively applied to only one political subdivision of the state: 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 30300 was a valid general law. Where a population fell below a certain number, the state legislature could reasonably have concluded that it was not necessary that fiscal control be regulated by a complete integration of the budgets of all county agencies. Under such circumstances, the control and supervision of the state superintendent of public instruction would be adequate. Thus, the population classification was reasonably related to the purpose of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city and officials sought review of a decree of the trial court (Florida), which held, in favor of appellee citizen, that two acts abolishing and recreating the municipality were unconstitutional and invalid under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 21 and Fla. Stat. ch. 11.02 (1955) because a notification required to be published before the acts' passage did not contain the substance of the acts as proposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee citizen filed an action against appellant city and its officials to have two acts of the state legislature declared unconstitutional and invalid. Appellee asserted that a published notice of intent to enact the legislation failed to set forth the substance of the proposed acts, in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 21 and Fla. Stat. ch. 11.02 (1955). The first act in question statutorily established the existence of the city, changing its status from that of a municipality, and the second act purported to repeal and reenact the provisions of the first act. The trial court held both acts unconstitutional and invalid, and appellants sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to enter an amended decree. The court held that art. III, &sect; 21 did not demand that the substance of a proposed act be published, but that ch. 11.02 did require such a notice, and that the notice published was sufficient under ch. 11.02. However, the court held the second act passed by the legislature was invalid under ch. 11.02, as the notice published applied to only the first act passed, and the second act was therefore enacted without the required notice.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that the validation decree having become final, the subsequently filed suits were collateral attacks on matters adjudicated by the final decree. Respondent claimed that the two suits presented substantial questions of law which were not settled by the validation decree. He also contended that ch. 29691 was unconstitutional. The court declined to take jurisdiction of the matter presented by petitioner. The court reasoned that by ch. 29691, the legislature attempted to confer upon the court original trial jurisdiction in contravention of Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; XI.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After serving a compulsory apprenticeship, the attorney applied to the commission for a real estate broker's license. The commission denied the application because the attorney did not serve the apprenticeship without engaging in another occupation, as required by a resolution of the commission.

The attorney argued that the resolution was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in failing to find that he could act as a real estate broker without a broker's license. At first, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that, under Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 475.01(2), the attorney could perform the functions of a real estate broker without a broker's license and, therefore, that no declaration to that effect needed to be made. On rehearing, the court reversed. While reiterating that the attorney, by virtue of his license, could perform any of the functions of a real estate broker without a broker's license, the court held that the resolution was unconstitutional because the commission had no authority to control the attorney's activities other than in the real estate field.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant secured a license to operate a tax collection agency and then applied for an auto tag agency permit. Appellee tax collector declined to issue the permit, because he had previously designated one of such agencies for each 50,000 persons or major fraction thereof, as authorized by Laws of Florida, Acts of 1953 ch. 28471. On appeal, appellant claimed that by the relatively simple procedure outlined in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 197.03 (1955), he should be allowed to handle auto tags as if ch. 28471 had not been passed. Appellant contended that he should have that privilege because the act was unconstitutional. The chancellor disposed of the litigation by holding that no right of appellant was infringed upon, so he was in no position to raise the question of constitutionality. The chancellor found that a member of the public had no right to collect taxes and that appellant could not complain. The court found, however, that appellant showed a sufficient interest to enter court and test the validity of the law. The court therefore reversed the decree with directions to the chancellor to determine the constitutionality of ch. 28471.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator argued that 1955 Fla.

The court denied relator's motion to compel respondent to allow him to qualify for the primary election and found that 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 29936 was the relevant statute. 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 29936 amended 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 30233 and changed the qualifying dates for candidates to state and county offices. Subsection 3 of &sect; 4 of 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 29936 was unconstitutional because it failed to operate uniformly throughout the state and because its classifications were unreasonable. The lack of a severability clause in 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 29936 did not invalidate the entire law. It was clear the legislature would have enacted the law even without the offending subsection because the legislature's goal was uniformity of qualifying dates for candidates. 1955 Fla.

Reversing the order, the supreme court held that it was error to infer guilt from appellant's silence. Based on various state and federal criminal laws, appellant was well-advised to remain silent. While no lawyer could be a member of the Communist Party without forfeiting the privilege to practice law, appellant's verified answer to the disbarment motion disavowed any connection with the Communist Party and raised issues upon which evidence should have been heard. Instead, disbarment was improperly entered solely on the evidence before the senate subcommittee, which did not prove the charges alleged.

As to a price sign for services, the requirement was the same as to size, and the requirement as to location was not less than 15 feet from any public sidewalk.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who was in custody awaiting the execution of his death sentence, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus questioning the legality of his judgment and sentence imposed by a circuit court (Florida). Previously, petitioner had claimed he could not be prosecuted under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.01 and that the sentence of death was illegal as he could only be prosecuted and sentenced under amendments to the Child Molester Act, ch. 28158.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who was in custody awaiting the execution of his death sentence, contended in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus that the sentence would deprive him of his life without due process of law and be in violation of the equal protection of the law guaranteed to him by section 1 of the Declaration of Rights of Florida and by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Petitioner contended that the death penalty for the crime of which he was convicted was in excess of the penalty provided for by Fla. Stat. ch. 801.03(1)(a), and the opinion of the court, holding that this rape statute was unconstitutional, deprived petitioner of his rights and protection afforded by the U. S. Constitution. The court denied the petition, finding that the contention was nothing more than a mere conclusion and no facts were alleged to justify such conclusion. Further, no federal question was involved. Instead, the questions attempting to be raised had previously been raised and settled. Moreover, habeas corpus could not be used to raise for the first time questions that petitioner had a fair and adequate opportunity to raise and could and should have raised during the formal trial of the cause, and on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The member brought an action against the board, claiming that ch. 28466 amounted to a removal of him from office, and the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the board. The member sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held that the member's office was statutory and not constitutional. The legislature's power to fix compensation under Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and held that the Florida Anti-Booking Statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 561.291, was not unconstitutional. The court found that appellant state officials were within their statutory rights to notify appellee corporation that a hotel operated by appellee would be denied telephone service because phones in the hotel were being used in violation of state gambling laws. The court found that the gambling law in question, the anti-booking statute, was passed under the authority of the legislature to impose criminal penalties for commission of certain prohibited acts. The court also found that enforcement of the contested statute by appellants did not constitute denial of due process to appellee. The court found no denial of due process because the statute allowed appellee to ask a court of equity to enjoin disconnection of telephone services before termination. Further, the court found that the statute addressed legitimate state objectives such as prohibition of criminal element associated with gambling and protection of state-run gambling facilities. Upon reversal, the court remanded for a determination on the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's finding that a state anti-booking statute was unconstitutional because it allowed appellant state officials to terminate phone services used to facilitate illegal gambling in appellee corporation's hotel. The court found that the contested statute did not deny due process because it allowed the affected party to seek an injunction in a court of equity. The case was remanded for a finding on the merits.</SPAN></P>

In addition, both under the equitable principles applicable to mandamus proceedings and the express command of the United States Supreme Court in its implementation decision, the exercise of sound judicial discretion required the court to withhold the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus, pending a subsequent determination of law and fact as to the time when plaintiff should be admitted to the law school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court denied appellant father's motion for a new trial after a jury rendered a verdict for appellees in an action pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.03, resulting from the fatal injury of appellant's four-year old son by appellees' car. Appellant contended that the trial judge committed error by instructing the jury that if the mother of the deceased child was guilty of negligence that proximately contributed to causing the accident and injury, they should return a verdict of not guilty for appellee. He informed the jury that it appeared from the testimony that the child was in the custody of its mother with the knowledge and consent of appellant and that the failure of the mother to observe reasonable care or to exercise reasonable care, control, and supervision would be applicable to both parents and would bar recovery by appellant. The court concluded it was proper to assert against appellant the defense of contributory negligence of the mother's negligent acts or failure to act of which appellant knew or should have known. In this case, it was appropriate to submit the question to a jury for its decision under proper instructions by the judge. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged a decree in favor of appellee county, which had the effect of precluding appellants from using their property for the construction of a hospital based on appellee's zoning and set-back regulations. The appellate court held that there were many other uses permitted by the applicable regulations and appellants were, therefore, not completely deprived of the beneficial use of their property. Additionally, the court held that zoning and set-back regulations were not offensive to the organic law because they were general in nature and were applicable to counties reasonably classified on a population basis. Further, the regulations were a valid exercise of the police power to promote the general welfare. Accordingly, the court held that regulations were reasonable as applied to appellants' property and the decision of the trial court was affirmed in all respects except how it was applied to the south side of appellant's property. The trial court's order was reversed as it applied to the south side of the property, which was measured from the street, because the court found that the set-backs should have been measured differently.</SPAN></P>

Respondent argued that petitioner did not comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 550.05 in its permit application and could not be issued a license under 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 31125, Special Acts. Petitioner argued that it had complied with ch. 550.05 and that it was not required to comply with ch. 31125 because the act was unconstitutional in that it denied petitioner the equal protection of the laws under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Fla. Const. Declaration of Rights &sect; 1. The court held that the statutory requirement had been met and that the statute did not require each year a re-application for the permit. The court also held that the act denied to petitioner the equal protection of the laws and that it was unconstitutional and void. A requirement, limited to petitioner or other holder of a jai alai permit in the county, was an unreasonable and arbitrary discrimination against a jai alai permit holder in the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord owned certain property upon which a package store was located. Plaintiff had a liquor license for the store. Plaintiff leased the property and the liquor license to defendant. The lease provided that the liquor license could not be sold or removed from that place of business. After a three-year lease expired, defendants held over and continued to pay rent. Before defendant vacated the premises, defendant transferred the liquor license in violation of the terms of the lease. The lower court dismissed plaintiff's complaint in part as not actionable, and dismissed the remainder for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiff appealed. The court found that a liquor license was valuable, assignable property, and the covenant in the lease was enforceable in equity. The holdover tenancy that arose from defendant's holdover with the consent of plaintiff landlord was presumed to be on the same covenants as the original lease. The court reversed and remanded because the trial court improperly reduced the holdover tenancy to one of sufferance. Defendant's holdover carried with it an obligation not to breach the provisions that were previously agreed to in the lease.</SPAN></P>

The carrier thereafter ceased compensation payments, and respondent initiated the present proceeding for further compensation benefits. The court denied the petition for certiorari because petitioner was not entitled to raise any question as to the sufficiency of the subrogation award because the question had been duly adjudicated in the forum and manner provided by the statute and affirmed upon appeal, and petitioner was foreclosed from attacking the validity of the statute under which the award was made in respect to a claim for compensation by the same claimant for the same injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order from the trial court (Florida) dismissing appellant's complaint on the ground that such complaint failed to allege that appellee willfully and intentionally permitted his cow to run at large thereby holding that the action was governed by the local law under 1945 Fla. Laws ch. 23326, and not by the Warren Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 588.12 et seq. (1951).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought action to recover damages arising out of an accident caused by a collision between an automobile and a cow on a public highway. At issue was whether such accident was governed by the Warren Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 588.12 et seq. (1951) or local law under 1945 Fla. Laws ch. 23326. Appellant argued that the local law was unconstitutional because its penalties conflicted with the punishment provisions of the Warren Act. The fact that the penal provisions of the local law were less severe merely had the effect of grafting the penal provisions of the Warren Act onto the local law. However, to require appellant to allege and prove that the cow's owner willfully and intentionally allowed his cattle to run at large was tantamount to holding that there could lawfully be a different basis of liability on the owner of livestock in each counties of within the state. Such interpretation of the Warren Act defeated plain legislative intent. As such, order dismissing appellant's complaint was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing appellant's personal injury suit, holding that the trial court's narrow construction of the language of the Warren Act, which required appellant to prove that appellee willfully and intentionally allowed his cow to roam, did not provide for liability of owners of livestock for damages and injuries caused by such livestock and completely defeated the plain legislative intent of the Act.</SPAN></P>

A chancellor held that the statute violated the federal and state constitutions, and permanently enjoined its enforcement. The chancellor held that the statute placed a penalty upon hotel operators for properly informing the public of varying rates. On appeal, the court held that the statute was a reasonable exercise of police power. It protected the public from loss through fraudulent or unscrupulous practices in commercial and financial transactions. The court further held that the statute was a species of social legislation, and legislative power was supreme. Therefore, the decree was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner contended, that the gambling law under which he was convicted, 1953 Fla. Laws ch. 28057, was unconstitutional. The court held that (1) under the evidence shown by the record and with no evidence of any kind that the gambling laws of Florida had been violated, it was the duty of a trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal as a matter of law; (2) the showing made failed completely to show any evidence of a corpus delicti and, therefore, probable cause for holding the prisoner; (3) Fla.

IX, &sect; 13 which provided that motor vehicles were subject only to license taxes. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff, and defendants appealed. The court reversed. There was no evidence on the record that plaintiff's cranes were in fact motor vehicles operated on the highways same as any other vehicle.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to try, convict and sentence him to the penalty of death because of the provisions of 1953 Fla.

Under the Child Molester Act, as amended, the sentence of a defendant convicted of the rape of a person who was 14 years or under was not to exceed 25 years in State prison. On appeal, the court determined that the 1953 Act amending the Child Molester Act did not comply with Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 because: (1) it embraced 11 different crimes denounced by other statutes of the State of Florida, (2) it did not publish at length the statutes with reference to rape that it attempted to amend, and (3) the title of the Act was insufficient to give notice that one of the purposes of the Act was to change the penalty for rape where the verdict was guilty without a recommendation for mercy, from death, to not exceeding 25 years, when the age of the female was 14 years or under.

The trial court dissolved the writ and terminated appellant's proceedings. Appellant sought review of the judgment. The court affirmed because appellant's allegation that a life insurance policy purchased solely to defraud a creditor was subject to garnishment was not presented for review in her appeal. Moreover, under Fla. Stat. ch. 222.14, the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies was only subject to garnishment if the policies were effected for the benefit of the creditor, and these policies were not intended to benefit appellant. Additionally, although the policies were issued before appellee became a resident of Florida, that did not mean that the cash value of the policies was not protected by Florida's exemption law because Florida's interest under exemption law did not arise until appellant sought to garnish exempt property. Finally, ch. 222.14 was not unconstitutional because appellant was not left without a remedy because she could levy execution on any of appellee's non-exempt property.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the cited subsection of the zoning ordinance was void, noting that if the result reached by the circuit court were permitted to stand, there would have been no business use to which the property in question could ever have been put which would not have been &quot;objectionable&quot; and therefore &quot;injurious&quot; to owners or occupants of surrounding properties.

The circuit court upheld the validity of the statute and remanded appellant to the custody of the sheriff. Appellant sought review of the order. The appellate court affirmed the remand order and the order upholding the statute. It stated that the legislature was not arbitrary or unreasonable in providing that possession of a wagering stamp constituted prima facie evidence of a violation of the law against gambling because the stamp had a reasonable relation to gambling and if appellant possessed it for another reason he was at liberty to prove it and to remove the presumption that he secured it for gambling purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision of a Florida circuit court that granted declaratory relief to appellee city in appellee's suit to validate certificates of indebtedness pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 87.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee brought suit for a declaratory degree against appellant under Fla. Stat. ch. 87, seeking to validate certificates of indebtedness. After the trial court entered a judgment granting the declaratory relief sought by appellee, appellant sought review, arguing only that the trial court erred in entering its final decree. In reversing and mandating that appellee's cause of action be dismissed with prejudice, the state supreme court concluded that appellee improperly attempted to use the declaratory judgment statute to validate certificates of indebtedness, which was provided for by Fla. Stat. ch. 75. Proceedings to validate certificates of indebtedness were required to be brought under Fla. Stat. ch. 75. The proceedings brought by appellee against the corporation that had agreed to purchase the certificates was not authorized, and such proceedings did not bind the citizens, taxpayers, and other interested parties who were not parties to the suit. The circuit court's judgment constituted nothing more than an unauthorized advisory opinion. As such, an appeal to the state supreme court was unauthorized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court judgment granting declaratory relief to appellee city under state statute was reversed, and the circuit court was instructed to dismiss appellee's suit, as appellee improperly sought to invalidate certificates of indebtedness under the declaratory relief statute. As such, the circuit court's declaratory judgment constituted nothing more than an unauthorized advisory opinion.</SPAN></P>

The claim for refund was filed with respondent, the state comptroller. Relator argued that he could not file a claim for a refund because he did not know that his right to do so had accrued until there was a final determination of the legality of the tax by the court. The court noted that there have been many suits in Florida to determine the validity of a tax to direct the making of a refund by respondnet under Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26. The court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26 required that an application of a refund be filed within one year after the right to such refund had accrued.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed suit for declaratory decree praying for an interpretation of Fla. Stat. ch. 454.031 (1951) in so far as it regulated admissions to the bar. Appellants had enrolled in September of 1951 and were to graduate in either February or June of 1954. To take advantage of the &quot;diploma privilege,&quot; the statute required a student to have enrolled no later than July 25, 1951, and obtain a degree by July 25, 1954. The trial court upheld the validity of the law. At issue was the constitutional validity of the cutoff date set forth in the statute for eliminating the diploma privilege for admission to the bar without the taking of an exam. The court affirmed, finding that the purpose of the statute was to do away with the &quot;diploma privilege&quot; and that necessarily required the fixing of some arbitrary date after which students enrolling would not have that privilege. The court found that the legislature had the power to enact the statute under the guise of its police powers. The court held that an arbitrary date after which all applicants to practice law were required to take an examination was not an undue hardship and did not violate appellants' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

To present a justiciable controversy in a declaratory judgment action, the parties were required to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 87. Plaintiff and defendant city admitted they had no statutory authority for their suit. Rather, they had filed suit because they knew of no other method for obtaining jurisdiction over defendant citizens, property owners, and taxpayers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the trial court (Florida), which convicted him of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to death. Defendant alleged error in the trial court's sequestration of defendant's expert witness, in the admission of prior crimes evidence, in the court's questioning of experts pursuant of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 917.02, and in failing to grant him a new trial for newly discovered evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no merit in defendant's assignments of error, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court noted that defendant himself had invoked the rule, and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to except defendant's expert from sequestration. The court held that evidence of defendant's revocation of probation in another jurisdiction was admissible to prove defendant's motive for refusing to be taken into custody by the police officer he shot and killed. The court held that the trial court did not violate the separation of judicial and executive powers mandated in Fla. Const. art. II by exercising the judicial prerogative under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 917.02 and examining the state's expert witnesses. Similarly, the court held that defendant's rights were not violated by requiring him to submit to examination by the experts, who were then subjected to the trial court's questions under &sect; 917.02. Where no juror that heard an improper remark by a sheriff was seated, the court held that the remark did not prejudice defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In respondents' action seeking to recover for respondent minor employees' personal injuries, relator employer sought a writ of prohibition limiting the respondents' remedy to that afforded under Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), Fla.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 450.021, 450.061, 450.111(4), respondent minor was of employable age but that, absent the permit required by Fla. Stat.

However, given the exclusivity provisions of the Act, Fla. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature made further classifications of dog tracks for taxation or revenue purposes, and it was upon this classification that an additional graduated tax was imposed. Appellant, a kennel club, argued that the additional tax based upon the new classification between dog tracks denied to it the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. Appellee urged that the tax should be upheld because it served a useful purpose. However, the court agreed with appellant and found that the additional tax imposed based upon the new classifications determined solely by the size of the daily gross receipts was a gross receipts tax. Thus, the court reasoned that the classifications were for tax purposes and such classifications were not based upon any substantial difference between the various classes established.

Moreover, the court held that the petition simply took issue with the court on the rulings and conclusions of the court and amounted to a re-argument of the original case without permission of the court. One of the petitioner's arguments stated that the court overlooked that the tax imposed was an excise tax or license tax for the exercise of the privilege for which the license tax was enacted. The court disagreed and held that those question were discussed, considered, and passed upon because of the state's constitution which prohibited taxes upon income in the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged trial court (Florida) judgments that quieted title in appellees against the reverter rights and interests of appellants, pursuant to 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 26927. Appellants contended that the act was unconstitutional and void as applied to their lands and others similarly situated because it impaired the contract obligation in their deeds and deprived them of their property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 26927 (the act), which cancelled all reverter provisions in plats or deeds conveying any interest in real estate which was in effect for more than 21 years. Thereafter, appellees filed suit to quiet title, alleging that appellants were the owners of such reverter rights and that appellants' interests were outlawed by the act. The trial court overruled appellants' motions to dismiss on the ground of unconstitutionality and entered final decrees quieting title in appellees. Appellants sought review and contended that the act was unconstitutional and void as applied to their lands and others similarly situated because it impaired the contract obligation in their deeds and deprived them of their property without due process of law. The appellate court reversed and remanded for dismissal of the complaints. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 192.33 provided that covenants running with the land survived and were enforceable after the issuance of a tax deed. The act's attempted saving provision afforded no remedy to appellants because no breach of the covenant had accrued so as to actuate enforcement of the right of reverter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the decrees that quieted title in appellees and remanded for dismissal of the complaints. The court ruled that the act hat cancelled reverter provisions was unconstitutional because it impaired the contract obligation in appellants' deeds and conflicted with a state statute that provided that covenants running with the land survived and were enforceable after the issuance of a tax deed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prohibition, under Fla.

The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's suit to enjoin enforcement of Hallandale, Fla., Ordinance 181, because appellee city had authority to make the ordinance. In addition, the ordinance did not violate federal and state laws that regulated the operation of airplanes.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner, who claimed he did not answer because he feared he could incriminate himself in state and federal court, sought a writ of habeas corpus. The State filed a motion to quash. The court held that there was no merit in petitioner's claim because the state immunity statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 932.29 (1951), protected petitioner from liability in state court, and the record showed no indication that federal prosecution was likely. Under the immunity statute, when a witness was required to testify regarding any of the listed categories of crimes, which included gambling, the witness was protected from prosecution for any offense substantially connected with the matter about which he testified, if the testimony was a link in the chain of evidence needed for prosecution of the witness.

Stat. ch. 541.001 et seq. (1951), against appellees, who moved to dismiss for, among other reasons, that the Act was unconstitutional and void. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. The issues concerned the constitutional validity of the Act's non-signer clause. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed, holding that the real vice of the non-signer clause was the absence of &quot;yard stick&quot; protection for the consuming public; in removing that standard from the Act's current language, the non-signer clause was an invalid use of the police power for a private, not a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee election officials filed a complaint seeking an interpretation of Fla. Stat. 100.081, relating to the nomination of county commissioners. The trial court entered a declaratory decree holding the proviso to ch. 100.081 unconstitutional and void and enjoining the conducting of elections to nominate county commissioners as provided therein. Appellant attorney general challenged the decree, and the appellate court affirmed. The court found that Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5 made specific provision for the election of county commissioners by the qualified electors of the county, and the effect of the statute was to restrict each elector's choice to one county commissioner when the constitution provided that he might vote for five. The court found that, therefore, the statute was invalid as it imposed an unreasonable and unnecessary burden on the right of suffrage as guaranteed by the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree that found a statute unconstitutional because it found that the state constitution prescribed a method by which county commissioners were elected, that the method was exclusive, that the legislature was powerless to unduly restrict it, and that the statute constituted such a restriction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that deputies were officers and not subject to civil service regulations in 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 27601.

Petitioner supported the allegation with statistics allegedly prepared by the state bureau of vital statistics which showed that for a 12-year period, there were 7 deaths from legal executions of non-white persons in petitioner's age group while, during the same period, there were no deaths from legal executions of white persons in the same age group. The court denied the prayer for relief, finding that the statistics in and of themselves did not prove, or tend to prove, any acts of discrimination because they were of such an inconclusive nature. The court held that because petitioner failed to raise the issue in any previous proceedings, including his appeal or his application for clemency, he waived or forfeited the right to raise it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prayer of the petition was denied. The mere fact that seven black defendants in petitioner's age-group were legally executed during a 12-year period, while no white persons within this age-group were executed, did not prove, or tend to prove, any acts of discrimination as between the races. Furthermore, petitioner waived or forfeited the right to raise the issue by his failure to timely assert it in previous proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator racing association secured an alternative writ of mandamus from the court directing respondent racing commission to modify its order allocating certain charity or scholarship racing days during a racing season. Respondent filed a motion to quash the alternative writ. Initially, the court rejected the contention that the recipients of the charitable funds were required to be joined as parties, holding that since the case was to settle validity and status of statutes, their presence as parties to the cause was not essential. The court also dismissed the contention that the funds raised amounted to state tax funds and that the attempt to withdraw them for charitable purposes without an appropriation was unconstitutional, finding that the profits did not constitute a tax since the donation of the profits was voluntary rather than mandatory. Rejecting relator's remaining arguments, the court held that the questions raised involved matters of pure legislative discretion and neither the legislature nor the commission transgressed its authority. As such, respondent's motion to quash the alternative writ was granted.</SPAN></P>

Laws 26993. This act provided that persons of specified qualifications were entitled to take the exam, which qualifications differed from those specified by the Florida Supreme Court. In granting the peremptory writ, the court held that the legislature had not withdrawn from the field of regulating admissions to the bar but retained concurrent power with the court to do so, and was thus fully authorized to enact ch. 26993. Further, the court found that respondents had no right to challenge the validity or constitutionality of the legislation, because as ministerial officers of the state, respondents had no alternative except to administer the law in accordance with the legislative mandate unless they could show an injury to their persons, property, or rights by its enforcement or that the administration of the act would have required the expenditure of public funds.

The court stated that when the challenge to the tax assessment was based on valuation, and not the constitutionality of the statute, the matter was not appropriate for a writ. The court stated that the fact that a decision by a circuit court may be brought to the court by appeal for review did not confer original jurisdiction on the court or justify by-passing the circuit court. The court held that the matter should be presented to the circuit court, and that if either party was aggrieved by the decision there, due process would allow for an appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator asserted that the Scholarship and Charity Acts, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator contended that the Scholarship and Charity Acts, Fla. Stat. chs. 550.03, 550.08, were violative of Fla.

In the alternative, relator contended that if the Acts were valid, the scholarship and charity days provided for by the Acts were to be allocated outside the 120-day racing season which began on December 1st of each year. Respondents contended that chs. 550.03, 550.08 extended the racing season from 120 days to 126 days and that the charity and scholarship days were not necessarily allocated before the beginning of or after the end of the 120-day season. The supreme court held that chs. 550.03, 550.08 were immune from constitutional attack. Furthermore, the court held that the scholarship and charity days created by chs. 550.03, 550.08 had to be awarded either prior to the beginning of the racing season or after the season ended and could not be allowed within the normal 120-day racing season. Therefore, the court concluded that respondents should grant relator a permit allowing relator to begin its racing season on March 4, 1954, and that the season would run for 40 consecutive racing days thereafter, excluding Sundays.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 29362 provided for the making of contracts by the city for the construction of public improvements by private parties and for the sale by the city of special assessment liens on abutting property as full payment. The issue was whether the city was empowered to assign the lien certificates and to authorize the contractor to bring an action in his own name in the event there was a default. The trial court found in favor of the city. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the city, pursuant to the specific statutory authority, could have assigned its lien certificates, and the conferring of the power by statute authorizing a lien holder to bring and action and enforce such lien in his own name was proper. While the liens were not technically negotiable instruments they were transferable as choses in action and become enforceable by the ultimate holder in his own name. The assessment of the liens and the assignment pursuant to ch. 29362 and the proposed agreement between the city and the contractor was not an unconstitutional exercise of the municipal taxing power of the city in violation of Fla.

Respondent alleged that the zoning ordinance constituted an unreasonable and unlawful restraint of his right to engage in his profession and caused him irreparable damage. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court denied petitioner's dismissal motion and petitioner sought interlocutory certiorari review.

III, &sect; 16, each law enacted in the legislature should embrace but one subject and matter properly connected therewith, which subject should be briefly expressed in the title. The act in question gave clear legislative intention to repeal 1933 Fla. Laws ch. 15934, the latter being an act to create a budget commission in each county falling within a certain population bracket. Nothing in the title put anyone on notice that it did not apply to the county unless and until the act was affirmed by a majority vote in an election. The court held that where an act was entitled one to repeal a designated statute, a proviso in the body of the act restricting the effect of the repeal was void because it was not covered by the title. Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the proviso of the challenged act was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order, which enjoined the holding of an election under the statutory provision. Because the act in question was entitled one to repeal a designated statute, the proviso in the body of the act, which restricted the effect of the repeal, was void because it was not covered by the title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court decree that found 1951 Fla.

Petitioners had brought an action that sought a determination of whether the statute was unconstitutional and a determination of their rights under that law. Although the state was required to be served with notice of the proceedings because petitioners claimed that the law was unconstitutional, that alone did not make it an adversarial party. Neither did the fact that appellant state attorney general filed an answer, reply, and a motion to dismiss. Therefore, there were no adverse parties and no actual controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Duval County (Florida) granting a motion to dismiss her amended complaint which alleged the facts stated in an original complaint and requesting that the trial court establish a Missouri final decree as a Florida decree, and, after its establishment, that the trial court modify the terms and conditions thereof relating to the support of the minor child by increasing the amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an original complaint seeking an increase in child support was dismissed, appellant mother filed an amended complaint requesting that the trial court establish a Missouri final decree as a Florida decree, and, after its establishment, that the trial court modify the terms and conditions thereof by increasing the amount of child support. The trial court granted appellee father's motion to dismiss upon the additional ground that the amended complaint constituted such a departure in pleading as to amount to the institution of a new and different suit as to which the Florida court lacked jurisdiction over defendant. On appeal, the court found the amended complaint sought the same basic relief upon essentially the same set of facts. The court held that there was no departure in pleading. Further the trial court had jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of the cause, and had the power upon a proper showing of changed circumstances to enter a decree, not by way of modification of the Missouri decree, but by way of supersession of the terms and conditions thereof. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the amended complaint did not wholly fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and hence that the decree appealed from should be reversed with directions that the cause proceed below in accordance with rules and with the principles stated in the opinion. The decree had no constitutional claim to a more conclusive or final effect in the state of the forum than it had in the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. ch. 323. A chancellor (Florida) denied petitioners' motions to dismiss. Petitioners sought certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 323 was the fundamental statute under which the Commission operated and registered motor vehicles operating in the State. Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 323 was passed to cure irregularities in the so-called Transportation Act of Florida, 1929 Fla. Laws ch. 13700, which had previously been declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. Under the truck rental agreements at issue, petitioners furnished drivers and trucks for single, one-way trips to deliver consignors' products to consignees; the consignees were not responsible, under the agreements, for the payment of Florida mileage taxes. The Commission contended that the agreements violated the Commission's rules and regulations and Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 323. The court held that petitioners' motions to dismiss were properly denied because Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 323 was constitutional; Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 323 overcame the irregularities in the prior Transportation Act. Although the State was not permitted to interfere with interstate commerce, it was permitted to supervise and regulate the use of its own highways, which it had done with the enactment of Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 323.</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged that &sect; 465.01(1) was an unconstitutional delegation of power of the legislature to the board and that the board's refusal to grant him a certificate without examination was unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory, and deprived him of his property without due process of law. The trial court held that &sect; 465.02(1) was constitutional and that plaintiff was not entitled to be registered as a pharmacist without taking the examination. The court affirmed. Section 465.02(1) did not delegate to the board unrestricted power to fix the scope of the examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited the parking or storing of any house car or trailer, which were commonly used for living and sleeping purposes, upon certain land in the City. In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the inmate alleged that the ordinance was not reasonable and was unconstitutional in that its application deprived a property owner of the reasonable use and enjoyment of his own property without due process of law. After a writ was directed to respondent, a custodian of a city jail, to show the cause of the inmate's detention, the custodian contended that the ordinance was duly enacted by the City as an integral part of a comprehensive plan for regulating the use of property within municipal limits. The inmate rested his case on the allegations contained in the pleadings. On appeal from the denial of the writ, the court held that the inmate had effectively admitted the custodian's allegations by showing no facts that gave rise to the inmate's arrest. The court also held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the City's police power because it was in direct pursuance of the City's authority to promote the general health and welfare and conserve the value of properties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant secured a judgment against a third party and filed a writ of execution that was retired unsatisfied. Appellant then sent a notice of lien to appellee Motor Vehicle Commissioner to be recorded on the certificate of title of a motor vehicle belonging to the judgment debtor. Appellee refused to file the notice of lien on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 319.27 did not permit or require a filing of a lien against the certificate of title arising from a judgment execution placed in the hands of a sheriff for levy. Appellant filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment to determine his rights under ch. 319.27. The circuit court held that ch. 319.27 did not require appellant to file or record notice of plaintiff's judgment or writ of execution on the certificate of title, and that ch. 319.27 did not deprive plaintiff of due process or equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Constitution, because appellant had other means to enforce his judgment lien.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parole commission appealed from the decision entering a decree upon the appellant's action. Appellant brought the action under the declaratory judgment statute in order to obtain a decree setting forth appellant's rights, privileges, and status under the Child Molester Law of Florida (Law), Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 801.01 et seq. The court held the Law was a constitutional exercise of the authority granted under the Fla. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 32. Under that provision, the legislature was empowered to establish the duties of the parole commission. However, the court held that the portion of the law, purportedly granting the commission the right to grant parole, conditional release, and probation, was beyond the power of the legislature to grant. Rather, the court held that the power of the commission was limited to that class of defendants who had been convicted but not yet sentenced. However, the statute was entirely silent as to how or in what manner that power was to be exercised. Therefore, the commission was without power to grant paroles, releases, or absolute discharges to defendants -- convicted but not sentenced -- once eligible for release from the state hospital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment appealed from.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent supervisor of registration sought review of a declaratory judgment of the Circuit Court of Duval County (Florida), which considered two provisions of the Election Code of 1951, declining to rule on the validity of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 97.111 and overturning as unconstitutional&nbsp;&sect; 101.111 as applied to petitioner's participation in a party primary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an elector whose attempt to change party affiliation was rejected by respondent supervisor of registration, argued that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 97.111, 101.111 of the Election Code of 1951 impaired his right to vote in the primary and general election of 1952. The court disagreed, noting first that &sect; 97.111 only prohibited a change in affiliation between primary and general elections, but did not affect petitioner's right to vote in the two elections. But the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 101.111 -- requiring that an elector seeking to vote at a primary election affirm that he voted for members of his party at the last general election -- was unconstitutional. The affirmation did not violate Fla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, by changing the qualifications of an elector, as party elections were limited by definition only to party members. Nor did the oath violate ballot secrecy protected by art. VI, &sect; 6. By the bare act of registering, an elector voluntarily disclosed his political preference; the failure to support party candidates was so inconsistent with affiliation that the act nullified registration and properly barred participation in electing that party's candidates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Declaratory judgment overturning statute as unconstitutional reversed, as statutory requirement of the Election Code of 1951 that petitioner, a registered voter seeking to change party affiliation, take oath affirming he voted for party candidates at last general election did not violate elector qualification or ballot secrecy provisions of Florida constitution as applied to petitioner's participation in party primary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner who was convicted of the unlawful possession of marijuana, appealed from a judgment of the trial court (Florida), assigning as grounds for reversal that the trial court erred in giving certain charges to the jury and in refusing to grant the defendant a new trial upon grounds that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the arrest of defendant without a warrant and that the subsequent search of his automobile was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was arrested and convicted of the unlawful possession of marijuana. At trial, the prosecution had presented a series of evidence, including an exchange between defendant and some women regarding whether or not he could provide them with &quot;stuff&quot;, how much it would cost, and where he would need to go to get the &quot;stuff&quot;, which demonstrated that their warrantless arrest of defendant for suspicion of having possession of marijuana was reasonable. Further, the prosecution had showed that the defendant consented to the search of his car immediately after his arrest and that the police found marijuana inside. Defendant appealed, alleging that his arrest was not based on reasonable grounds and that the search of his car was illegal. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling, finding that the arrest of the defendant was proper because there were reasonable grounds for the police to believe that defendant was committing a felony and that the search of his car and the use of the contraband found within as evidence was also proper because defendant had consented to the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of the unlawful possession of marijuana was affirmed because the police had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was committing a felony; and the contraband which the police seized from defendant's automobile was admissible because defendant had given the police officer's consent to search his automobile.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 10951 as unconstitutional and barred the municipality from invoking the provision to annex appellees' land to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, owners of unannexed land within appellant city, argued that because 1925 Fla. Laws ch. 10951, &sect; 67 (Act), was not within the purview of the Act's title, as required by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, appellant had no authority to annex the lands of appellees to the city. The court disagreed, ruling that the constitutional requirement was met because &sect; 67, the annexation provision, was reasonably related to the &quot;subject&quot; of the Act as reflected in the title so as to provide notice that annexation authority was being conferred upon appellant municipality. The language in the title -- to constitute a municipality, to define boundaries, and to provide for jurisdiction -- was sufficient to put appellees on notice that their property might be affected by the newly created municipality, the court ruled. In support of its conclusion, the court observed that a 1920 general statute -- similarly titled -- had precisely the same language as &sect; 67 in authorizing cities to annex contiguous lands. That being the case, the court stated, appellees were put on reasonable inquiry as to appellant's authority and that city boundaries were not &quot;fixed&quot; as of the time of the Act's enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment construing annexation provision of a 1925 statute as unconstitutional and barring appellant municipality from invoking the provision to annex appellees' land to the city reversed, and remanded to resolve other questions of law, because provision satisfied Florida constitutional mandate that provision be with purview of law's title, as title's reference to appellant's &quot;boundaries, powers, and jurisdiction&quot; was related to &quot;annexation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner bus company appealed from a decision, by the respondent public utilities commission, ordering petitioner to stop providing local transportation services which petitioner had been providing based upon authority granted to a predecessor certificate holder. The court held the authority granted by the commission prohibited the provision of local transportation services within the corporate limits of Miami Beach. The language of the commission's original order clearly indicated that if local service was intended, an express provision for that service would have been included. Further, there was no showing petitioner ever secured from the City of Miami Beach a permit to operate local passenger service. The court held that the commission's previous order had no res judicata effect with reference to purely judicial proceedings. Rather, any administrative determination was subject to being superseded by another order because the commission had the power and duty to modify pre-existing orders when new evidence was presented. The fact petitioner had been conducting a local service over a considerable period of time simply indicated it had been doing what it had no authority to do.</SPAN></P>

The court held that U.S. Const. amend. IV did not operate to protect the appellants because the Fourth Amendment was not a limitation upon the powers of the state or its officers. The court held that the warrantless search of the appellants' back room and the seizure of certain gambling equipment from that room constituted an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Declaration of the Rights of the State of Florida &sect; 22. The right of appellee law enforcement officers, under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 561.07, 562.03, to inspect a place of business of business licensed to sell liquor did not extend to portions of the appellants' place of business unconnected with the sale of liquor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a registered land surveyor, was employed to survey a piece of land. He made two efforts to do so, for which he provided plaintiff, his client, with a map of his work.

Plaintiff subsequently filed a complaint that alleged malpractice, malfeasance, gross carelessness, and gross incompetency in the practice of land surveying. Judgment was in plaintiff's favor. Defendant's certificate of registration was also revoked. He then appealed the revocation to the circuit court by certiorari or, in the alternative, by writ of mandamus. Both writs were denied, and the revocation order was affirmed. An appeal followed. The court reversed and reinstated defendant's certificate of registration. The court held that there was no conclusive evidence to support the charges against defendant. The court explained that the record disclosed only an imperfect survey, but there was no suggestion of fraud, misrepresentation for criminal neglect of professional duty, or violation of public trust to warrant the alleged charges and revocation of the certificate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff radio station owner filed a bill of complaint seeking adjudication of certain questions regarding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 99.161 and its effects upon a radio station and the rights of one running a radio station. The statute prohibited contributions to a candidate except through the campaign treasurer. The radio station owner appealed a decree of a trial court (Florida) that upheld the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 99.161 was constitutional and that it was a valid exercise of the police power. Although the statute had the effect of abridging the freedom of utterance of many who wished to use the facilities of radio to express their support of a candidate, the test of the validity of police power was whether it was directed toward an appropriate end and as a reasonable means to that end. The statute did not prohibit anyone from making a speech advocating a candidate. It only required that the contribution should be authorized by the candidate or his campaign treasurer and that it should be reported by the candidate or his treasurer. The legislature appeared to have been motivated to defend free elections from the unfettered use of money to sway the public and control the mediums by which the public became acquainted with candidates and issues. The trial court concluded that the radio station owner failed to meet his burden of showing how and in what manner his constitutional rights would be or had been invaded or infringed in order to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's findings and its decree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was in the wrecking and towing business. The City Commission of Ft. Lauderdale (commission) entered into a contract with appellant to keep the streets cleared of wrecks, derelicts and other impediments to freely moving traffic. The contract provided day and night service for five years. The commission entered into the contract in reliance on Chapter 24514, Special Acts of 1947, which authorized it to promulgate regulations governing the traffic or parking of automobiles on the streets. Appellee filed suit, asserting that the contract was invalid and unenforceable because it ran beyond the length of the commission's term. The lower court ruled in appellee's favor, and appellant sought review in the court. The court reversed, holding that because the commissioners' terms were staggered, the commission was a continuing body and was entitled to contract for any reasonable time since there was no point at which the terms of all commissioners came to an end. The court further agreed with the commission that the contract emanated from a valid proprietary function.</SPAN></P>

The cock breeders sought a declaratory judgment that this statute did not apply to them and that it was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff contended that the cock fighting engaged in by the cock breeders was condemned by Fla. Stat.

The cock breeders claimed that their business of raising, training, fighting, and selling highly bred game cocks did not fall within the confines of this statute, and that, if it did, the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the method of selection employed by the cock breeders fell within the confines of the statute. However, the court agreed that the statute was unconstitutional and reversed the lower court's judgment. The court found that, in prohibiting cruelty to animals, the statute prohibited cock fighting on land but permitted it on watercraft. The court held that there was no reasonable basis for this classification, that it constituted an unreasonable and arbitrary discrimination, and that it denied the cock breeders equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the authority of Fla. Const. art. 4, &sect; 13, the governor requested that the court interpret 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 26945, enacted to amend Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 509.02, providing for the appointment of a hotel commissioner. The governor asked whether his duty under Fla. Const. art. 4, &sect; 6 included the duty to make an appointment to fill such office, and if so, for what period of time or term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state legislature passed 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 26945 (Act), amending state law on the appointment and duties of a hotel commissioner, the governor requested an interpretation of the Act in order to discern his duty to make an appointment to fill such office, and, if he had such duty, for what period of time. The court held that &sect; 2 of the Act was in direct conflict with Fla. Const. art. 3, &sect; 27 and vitally affected the constitutional powers and duties of the governor by requiring that the hotel commissioner be employed by the governor and the cabinet. The Florida Constitution was clear and unequivocal that the governor had the sole power in the state to make such a statutory appointment. Accordingly, in view of the fact that the hotel and restaurant commissioner was a public officer, &sect; 2 of the Act was in direct violation of Fla. Const. art. 16, &sect; 7, and was void. Because &sect; 2 of the Act failed and was not saved by the savings clause in &sect; 10 of the Act, the entire Act failed. Under Fla. Const. art. 3, &sect; 27 and art. 4, &sect; 7, the governor had the duty to appoint the hotel commissioner for the unexpired term to end concurrently with the end of the governor's term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25554 was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art.

The court affirmed the lower court's convictions and found the statute constitutional on its face. 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25554 was a general law because it was based upon a reasonable classification according to population and was not unreasonable with respect to the subject matter of the act. Other counties were well within the population figure in 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25554. It was not unreasonable for the legislature to require 23 people on grand juries in counties with a population exceeding 315,000 people. In larger counties, grand juries were in session more often and a larger number of jurors prevented jurors from being constantly away from their vocation. The court could not determine whether 1949 Fla.

The court receded from the lower court's opinion that held appellant could not raise the question of the constitutionality of the Act because of her failure to show that at the time the indictment was returned against her more than eighteen members of the grand jury were participating. The validity of the grand jury so far as the number of its members was concerned had to be determined with respect to the date the body was organized. It could not be said that if a grand jury composed of 23 members may be legally organized under the Act, the actions of the body thereafter can be successfully challenged accordingly as fewer or more than 18 sit at particular meetings. The Act, being constitutional as a general law, indictments returned by a grand jury organized under it would be valid if found by 12 members concurring, no matter how many of the whole authorized number of 23 participated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was served with copy of the information and was given an opportunity to file his defense. Defendant failed to do so, and default was entered against him.

Defendant appealed, and the circuit court affirmed. Defendant sought further review, arguing plaintiff failed to follow the procedures set out in Fla. Stat. ch. 475.30. The court rejected defendant's argument and affirmed, because plaintiff was authorized to enter its order based upon its finding that the facts in the information were admitted and without taking proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit to contest the results of a primary election. The result of the election hinged on absentee ballots, which gave plaintiff's opponent a majority. Contending that none of the absentee electors left either a formal or informal written application for ballot before obtaining their ballots from the supervisor, plaintiff claimed the election was invalid. Finding that some of the ballots were obtained without first submitting a formal or informal written application, the trial court held that the absentee ballots were invalid. In its analysis, the court focused on Fla. Stat. chs. 101. 61 and 101.62. In doing so, the court held that a statute should be so construed and applied as to give effect to the evident legislative intent, even if the result seemed contradictory to rules of construction and the strict letter of the statute. As such, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 101.62 did not require a written application for ballot in order to receive a ballot and did not require an informal request to contain any of the statutory reasons which permit the casting of an absentee ballot.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 26465 was unconstitutional because it attempted by a special or local law to regulate the duties of county officers. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 26465 was unconstitutional because it usurped the rights, powers, and privileges conferred by general law upon county officers. However, the court reversed the decision of the trial court, holding that ch. 27096 was a special law or local law, resting merely upon an arbitrary classification of population alone, without any reasonable differences to justify such classification, and hence was unconstitutional. Consequently, the county was governed by the budget commission law provided for under Fla. Stat. ch. 14678 (1931).</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 421.08, which appellee city and appellee housing authority used to implement a redevelopment project. The statute provided a means of acquiring by purchase or eminent domain real estate in a blighted area in order to make it available for sale or lease to private enterprises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner instituted a suit to restrain or enjoin appellee city and appellee housing authority from acquiring some of his land, which was located in a blighted area, by eminent domain or purchase. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 421.08, which authorized the taking. Appellant sought review after the trial court denied the application for injunctive relief and upheld the validity of the statute. Appellees argued that unless they acquired title to and ownership of the land at issue, they had no means or method of coping with clearing up the blighted area. On review, the supreme court found that there was no merit to appellees' contention. The court reasoned, however, if the only purpose of the statute was to remove or abate a blighted area, police power was sufficient. The court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 421.08 was unconstitutional in that it infringed upon various inalienable property rights of the citizens of the state. Therefore, the supreme court reversed the trial court's decision with directions to set aside the order dismissing appellant's complaint.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal and ordered further proceedings, finding that although intervenors' petition for an alternative writ sought a final adjudication of the application for a liquor license transfer, no final adjudication was entered. Appellant's cause was, therefore, dismissed on the basis of the state beverage director's approval of intervenors' application to transfer the liquor license to the zoned location. The court held that the beverage director was without authority to make such a determination because the director's function was ministerial, not judicial.

The court ruled that the statute, which imposed a one-year residency requirement as a condition precedent to a landowner's right to claim a homestead exemption, a right guaranteed by Fla. Const. art.

The court noted that in determining whether a challenged statute was violative of constitutional provisions, the rule was that the constitutionality of a statute was to be determined by its practical operation and effect.

The court denied petitioner's writ of habeas corpus, without prejudice so that petitioner could seek release once cured. The court found that the statute under which petitioner was committed was a proper exercise of the inherent police power of the state, and was not violative of petitioner's constitutional rights. The court held that the exercise of the police power was a discretionary matter for the legislature and the court would not interfere except where regulations adopted to protect public health were arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court erred by dismissing an immunity defense because appellant was supported by taxes and, therefore, was an arm of the county and immune from the damages recovered by appellee. The appellate court affirmed the trial court, finding that the activities of hospitals fell more clearly in the category of proprietary functions than governmental functions. An enterprise was not governmental in character simply because the government entered it or the legislature declared it so. The court held that patients who paid for services were justified in expecting they would receive expert services free of negligence.

Appellant challenged the act authorizing such action on the grounds that it violated the Fla. Const. art. XII, &sect;&sect; 10 and 17. The trial court found the act constitutionally valid and dismissed the complaint. After dismissing appellant's argument that the tax areas provided by the act were not special tax school districts as contemplated by the constitution, the supreme court went on to hold that appellee did have the power to issue the bonds provided that two constitutional conditions were met: the amount of the bonds, when added to the other bonds issued by appellee did not exceed 20 percent of the value of the real estate in the district and that the ad valorem tax when added to any other such tax did not exceed 10 mills.

The trial court denied appellants' motion to quash the information, motion for a bill of particulars, and jurisdictional pleas. The jury convicted appellants as charged. After denying appellants' motions for new trial, the trial court imposed an alternative sentence of a fine or two years confinement. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the arrest, search, and seizure of appellants was done in a lawful manner. Moreover, certain testimony tending to connect appellants with the lottery violations was not inadmissible hearsay and such testimony was entirely within the personal knowledge of the testifying witnesses. At any rate, the trial court's formal instructions at the close of the case cured any possible prejudice. Finally, the legislative act, 1945 Fla. Laws ch. 22837, that created the lower court was constitutional. Inter alia, the legislature could create a criminal court of record without first requiring application of a majority of the registered voters in the affected county.</SPAN></P>

Within five days after being notified of delinquency, they advised the beverage department that the credit law was unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellants' request for injunctive relief and appellants sought review. The supreme court noted that the law prohibited manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors from having any financial interest in retailers, directly or indirectly, and also limited the extension of credit to retailers to 10 days after the calendar week in which a sale was made. The judgment was affirmed. The court had repeatedly held that a retail liquor license authorizing the purchase for sale and the selling of liquors was merely a privilege granted by the state pursuant to law under restricted terms, conditions, and regulations imposed by the state because of injurious effect of the use of intoxicants on the health and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that a municipality was a creature of legislation that derived its power from the legislature. The court further noted that statutes authorizing tax levies were strictly construed with doubts resolved against the tax.

The court found that the expenditures incident to the referendum election would serve a county purpose and were, therefore, constitutional. Since the officers of a district were neither state nor county officers, it was not necessary that they be elected by the people, and the ad valorem tax was constitutional so long as the tax rate was uniform throughout the territory embracing the particular municipality.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the dismissal of appellant's action because the certificates of indebtedness issued to pay for the construction project were objectionable. The method approved for paying for construction projects with certificates of indebtedness did not contemplate an obligation to pay to the certificate holder any money except that realized from the building tax. The language in appellee's certificates that the full faith and credit of the county was irrevocably pledged to payment of the certificates from the tax violated Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6, assuming the words were not superfluous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's dismissal of appellant's action, which challenged appellee's construction project for a new jail and repair of the courthouse. Appellee's publication of notice once a week for five weeks in a daily newspaper was proper notice, but language in the certificates of indebtedness irrevocably pledging the county to pay the certificates from the tax was improper and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee town issued appellant bar owner a liquor license, and appellant then filed an application for an alcohol vendor's permit.

Appellant initiated an action challenging the validity of the ordinance and sought an order requiring appellee to issue him a permit. The court granted appellee's motion to dismiss. Appellant contended that the ordinance conflicted with Fla. Stat. chs. 561.20 and 561.34. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 561.44(1), the state granted appellee the power to establish zoning ordinances that restricted the locations where vendors could sell alcohol.

In his order setting forth his reasons for issuing the writ, the trial judge noted that petitioner was a graduate of an accredited school or college of pharmacy holding membership in a recognized association of colleges of pharmacy, in compliance with the requirement of Fla. Stat. ch. 465.02. The trial court construed that statute as constituting, in reality, a legislative determination that the schools that were on the membership rolls of the association at that time (such as petitioner's) were designated as &quot;accredited,&quot; just as if each such school had been designated by name in the statute.

The court noted that the Act's constitutionality had already been upheld in a prior decision. Petitioner also argued that the dissemination of gambling information did not fall within the inhibitions of the act, because the telephone line used by the subscriber in transmitting the information was not a private wire as defined in the act. The court held that the facts reflected within the record were within the inhibitions of the act, because the prohibition of the dissemination of gambling information on the part of telephone utilities, or their subscribers, was the end intended by the enactment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a judgment of a trial court (Florida) upholding an ordinance of appellee City of Miami, Miami, Fla., Ordinance No. 3811, which was passed pursuant to the &quot;population act,&quot; 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25536. Both the ordinance and the statute allowed a woman to work in a liquor establishment as a licensee but not as an employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City passed Miami, Fla., Ordinance No. 3811 pursuant to 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25536 (the act), which empowered municipalities within counties having a population in excess of 315,000 to ordain that no female mix or dispense any intoxicating liquors at or from any bar unless she was the licensee. The trial court upheld the ordinance. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was invalid because the act was unconstitutional. The test for the validity of the act was the reasonableness of the basis for the classification or the relationship between the classification and the object sought to be accomplished. The act allowed any municipality in Dade County to impose the restriction. Thus, a city of any number of inhabitants situated within the large county would benefit by the act, while all other cities of like population in the whole State of Florida would not, simply because the counties where they were located had not entered the higher population bracket. Thus, there was not only an absence of reasonable relationship between the arbitrary population figure and the object of the legislation, but of any relationship at all. Such a classification was a nullity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought permission of the municipal authorities to move his business to a new location, however, under City of Miami Ordinance 725, he was prohibited from selling liquors in any place of business located within 1000 feet in an airline. Appellant assailed the validity of ordinance 391 as eventually amended by ordinance 725, by claiming that the latter should be declared arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory. In addition, appellant claimed that ordinance 725 was in violation of the Declaration of Rights, Fla. Stat. ch. 1 and 12, and of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court did not find a violation of the Declaration of Rights or of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that the ordinance was presumptively valid and that the issue of the existence of an emergency rested in the judgement and discretion of appellee's city council because circumstances had arisen which empowered said council to meet them immediately by accelerating the enactment of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The grand jury adopted a motion requesting the State Attorney to institute an action against defendant for his refusal to divulge the source of his information. The trial court issued a rule nisi directed to defendant and adjudged him guilty of contempt. The court affirmed, holding it was contempt to refuse to testify in a supplementary proceeding such as in taking depositions or the refusal to testify before a grand jury. Defendant was asked questions purporting to reveal testimony given by witnesses who had previously appeared before the grand jury. He was also asked about certain matters that the grand jury purportedly had deliberated and voted, including a statement that one person not then in custody had been indicted by the grand jury. The grand jury was organized under 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25554, which was general and uniform in its operation throughout the several counties of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant for libel. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer. Plaintiff appealed, alleging Fla. Stat. ch. 770.01 and 770.02, which limited his rights to recover for libel from defendant, were unconstitutional. The court found the statute which limited recovery to actual damages did not unconstitutionally impair plaintiff's rights as punitive damages were not a property right. The statutory provision for retraction prior to suit was appropriate for newspapers, as distinguished from private persons, and did not violate the equal protection clause because the free dissemination of news was a public interest. The opportunity to correct inadvertent errors prior to suit was justly commensurate with defendant's opportunity to make the errors. Further, the statement alleged to be libelous was not libelous per se and there was no issue for the jury. The plaintiff having failed or refused to avail himself of the opportunity to amend his declaration, there was no error in entering final judgment for the defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision sustaining defendant's demurrer as the statutes giving defendant the right to retract any defamatory statement were constitutional and the statement was not libelous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court sustained a motion to quash an alternative writ of mandamus and dismissed the action filed against respondent members of state canvassing board by relator congressional candidate. Relator contended that in the Democratic primaries held in the First Congressional District, none of the candidates received a majority of the votes cast in the first primary but respondents, after canvassing the returns, certified that relator and another received the two largest number of votes and were each entitled to run as candidates in the second primary. Relator alleged that respondents were without lawful authority to certify a certain named individual because the votes cast in Pinellas County in the two primary elections were invalid as they were conducted under certain provisions of General Acts of 1947, Special Acts of 1949, and each thereof was unconstitutional and void. On appeal, the court found the constitutional invalidity was presented some 28 days after the date of the second primary. The doctrine of estoppel was controlling. Also relator had failed to demonstrate that his rights had been so adversely affected as to entitle him to mandamus. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision below to quash the alternative writ of mandamus on the grounds that relator congressional candidate was estopped from challenging the constitutionality of the statutes in question because he actively participated in each phase of the two primaries and filed the suit 28 days after he was defeated at the polls. Relator also failed to demonstrate an adverse effect on his rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant telephone company notified plaintiff company that, on the demand of the attorney general, it was terminating plaintiff's telephone service. Plaintiff filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the termination of service. The complaint was dismissed by the circuit court for lack of jurisdiction. The circuit court held that the issues were matters for defendant commission, which had regulatory control over defendant telephone company. On appeal by plaintiff, the court affirmed the dismissal. Defendant was warranted in discontinuing its service when notified to do so by the attorney general, because the telephone service was being used to unlawful ends. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 364.20, defendant commission had promulgated valid rules permitting discontinuation of service used for unlawful purposes. Moreover, defendant commission was the entity authorized to determine whether, after such discontinuance, plaintiff was entitled to restoration of service, including conditions under which granted. Thus, the circuit court properly dismissed plaintiff's appeal based on its lack of jurisdiction in view of the grant of authority to defendant commission.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued on appeal that the statute was unconstitutional because it was unreasonable and arbitrary in its provision for a shorter limitations period to institute actions against municipalities than against private persons and other corporations. The appellate court rejected appellants' argument and affirmed. The many differences between a municipality, existent under Fla. Const. art.

Laws ch. 26319, Fla. Stat. ch. 212.01 et seq. (1949), constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, landlord of a multi-family dwelling, was arrested for refusing to keep records or collect taxes levied upon rentals as required by the Florida Revenue Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 212.01 et seq. (1949). Appellant filed a writ of habeas corpus constitutionally challenging the law. On review from denial of the writ, the court determined that the tax was not a property tax but was properly classified as an excise tax and that none of its provisions impinged upon appellant's constitutional rights. Taking judicial notice of the public necessity of the tax, the court held that the legislature was authorized to raise revenue by an occupational privilege tax. The effective date of the law was provided therein and the law embraced but one subject. The law reasonably exempted small operators and distinguished between transient and more permanent guests. The requirement that the tax be collected from the tenant was designed to protect small operators and did not violate due process. Although paid by the tenant, the tax was levied upon and enforced against the landlord. Finally, the method for determining the amount of the tax due and for enforcing the collection thereof was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order from the lower court that denied appellant landlord's writ of habeas corpus, finding that the state revenue code that required appellant to collect taxes from his tenants, and keep records thereof, was a constitutional excise tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant municipality was created by an act of the legislature, appellant issued bonds for municipal improvements. Subsequently, 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 26053 was enacted. Appellant filed a bill for a declaratory decree that 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 26053 was unconstitutional. Appellant stated that 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 26053 contracted appellant's original limits and relieved lands in the excluded territory from tax liens. Appellant argued that 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 26053 was unconstitutional because it excluded territories from tax liens, but provided no provision to protect bond holders. Appellee landowner owned property that was within appellant's original limits, but was outside of appellant's limits after the enactment of 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 26053. The trial court dismissed appellant's bill for a declaratory decree. The reviewing court held that appellant had no interest that allowed appellant to challenge legislation that diminished appellant's area. Therefore, the trial court's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state racing commission annulled a permit issued to a racing club controlled by petitioner court receiver following the court's decision that the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.06 (1935) required cancellation where the holder failed to conduct racing within 12 months after the passage of the act. The court also held that such provisions were not self-executing. Petitioner filed suit against respondent, claiming that respondent had been stripped of its authority to annul permits when ch. 550.06 was repealed by omission from the Florida Statutes of 1941 and that a new statute allowing the repeal of such permits was unconstitutional. On appeal the court denied certiorari review. The court found that even if ch. 550.06 had been repealed by omission, the duty of respondent was not affected, as the permit's annulment should have taken place before the adoption of the Florida Statutes of 1941. The court held respondent's action in repealing the subject permit was merely ministerial and unaffected by omission of ch. 550.06 from the 1941 statutory compilation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for appellee on the ground that appellant failed to aver or show that the warrants sued upon were issued in accordance with the state constitution and laws. The supreme court reversed the judgment with directions to overrule appellee's demurrer. The court rejected appellee's argument that the entire act was void because section 1 of the act was not expressed in the title of the act as required by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The court held that the title of an act did not have to be an index, provided that it was not misleading or deceptive.

The lower court granted appellee Attorney General and Florida Railroad and Public Utilities Commission's motion to dismiss. Appellants' contended that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 365.01 (1949) could not have been upheld as a valid police regulation because of the limitation on the state power by U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court stated that the State had the ability to have regulated any enterprise, trade, occupation or profession , if necessary, to have protected the public health, welfare or morals. The court also stated the law that prevented the dissemination of information that enabled the recipient to have bet on a sporting event would not have been overthrown under the Commerce Clause, unless it was shown to have disrupted lines of communication that was essential to uniformity of the states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent state commission scheduled a hearing on a local cab company's application for permission to carry passengers between petitioner city and the suburbs, petitioner sought a writ of prohibition enjoining respondent from taking any action. Challenging the constitutionality of 1947 Fla. Laws ch. 24806, which delegated certain powers to petitioner to regulate local transportation, respondent filed a motion to strike and return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local cab company applied to respondent, the state railroad and public utilities commission, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate as a common carrier of passengers between petitioner city and designated points in the adjoining suburban territory. Petitioner applied for a writ of prohibition to enjoin respondent from entertaining the application or proceeding with a scheduled hearing. Respondent's motion to strike and return challenged the validity of 1947 Fla. Laws ch. 24806 (the Act), arguing that the Act unconstitutionally divested it of jurisdiction to regulate transportation in the area around petitioner. Finding that respondent could lawfully challenge the constitutional validity of the Act, the court held that the Act was constitutional. Because the primary function of respondent was statewide, the function of petitioner and respondent might overlap at times. Thus, the court denied petitioner's writ of prohibition insofar as it attempted to interfere with respondent's performance of the duty delegated to it under the Act. Insofar as the power delegated to petitioner was shown to be trenched on, however, the writ of prohibition was granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the state legislature could constitutionally delegate certain regulatory powers over local transportation to petitioner city, the court held that respondent state commission could not encroach on petitioner's powers as defined by the applicable act. Likewise, petitioner could not interfere with respondent's duties under the act. Thus, petitioner's writ of prohibition was both granted and denied.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners were granted a writ of certiorari and the order of the trial court was quashed because respondents' property benefited or was reasonably susceptible to benefit from the bond and, therefore, should be assessed upon a just and uniform basis for its proportionate share of the debt.

It found no language in the act which showed an intention to discharge the grand jury which was in existence at the time of its passage. Since relator did not charge that ch. 25554 infringed or denied any of her rights guaranteed by the Constitution, it was not only unnecessary but improper for to discuss the question of its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged the writ of habeas corpus because it found the grand jury which indicted relator had not been dismissed by operation of law and that the indictment was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants brought suit challenging the imposition of an excise tax. Complainants alleged that St. Petersburg, Fla., Ordinance &sect; 1104-B was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in complainants' favor. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed the judgment. According to the supreme court, respondent city could not impose any taxes without a specific grant of power because such taxes were out of the usual range of power conferred on respondent city. The supreme court held that the tax proposed by section 1104-B was a tax over and above the license tax authorized by the provisions of the City Charter. The supreme court held that St. Petersburg, Fla., ch. 15505, &sect; 3(c), authorized the city to impose license taxes upon privileges, businesses, occupations, and professions carried on and engaged in within the city. The supreme court held that an excise tax was not within the authority of respondent city's charter. Moreover, the supreme court held that the excise tax was invalid because it was not just and reasonable where the tax demanded took more than the net earnings of the business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25574 (Act) created civil claims courts. When petitioner filed suit in respondent judge's civil claims court, respondent declined to assume jurisdiction on grounds of the Act's unconstitutionality. Petitioner filed for writ of mandamus to compel respondent to assume jurisdiction and proceed with the cause, and respondent filed a motion to quash. The court summarily rejected the argument that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not properly promulgate power to the civil claims courts, based on precedent. The court also rejected the argument that the Act's notice requirements did not provide adequate notice because they did not run in the name of the state. The court noted the general rule that the requirements of state and federal constitutional due process were satisfied when the notice was sufficient to advise defendant of the charge or claim against him and give him ample opportunity to present his defense to it. A sheriff's return was sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. The court also found the Act did not unduly restrict a litigant's right to a jury. Finding the Act constitutional and the court valid, the motion to quash was overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant commissioners issued certificates of indebtedness that were to be used to improve and construct a state highway in the county. Plaintiff taxpayer filed a bill of complaint to restrain the issuance of the certificates on grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 26080 was unconstitutional. Further, plaintiff argued that defendants were without power to give notice of sale of the certificates of indebtedness, to receive bids therefor, to execute and deliver the certificates and to levy a tax on the taxable property the county with which to pay the certificates of indebtedness. The lower court sustained a motion to dismiss the bill of complaint and plaintiff appealed. The court found that sections of Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrators sought review of the lower court decision dismissing appellants' cause of action brought to recover claims against appellee executor. The court held that acceptance of service was as effective as service of process upon the appellee. This was especially true when the acceptance of service was fortified by appellee's actual participation in the suit to its conclusion. The court held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733.16, prescribing the way in which estate claims must be filed, was intended to facilitate an orderly and expeditious settlement of estates, was procedural in nature, and remedial in character. In addition, the court held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733.16 should have extra-territorial application. The court held that the purported retroactive provision of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733.16 did not render the statute invalid because the statute did not establish new or violate vested rights.

On appeal, the supreme court affirmed. According to the supreme court, section 230.43(1) made it a duty of respondent to consider the recommendations of the superintendent for the position of supervising principal of the school district. The supreme court held that section 231.35 provided that respondent was required to act on the appointment and could only reject the appointment for good cause. The supreme court found that respondent failed to show good cause for the rejection of the appointment. The supreme court held the statutory language was clear as to respondent's responsibilities. Next, the supreme court held that section 231.35 was valid and constitutional because it did not conflict with Fla. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10.

Plaintiffs appealed. The court reversed, finding that plaintiffs did not wholly fail to set forth a cause of action even though their pleadings lacked many specific allegations as to the infringement of personal or property rights which would be appropriate to sustain the their right to attack the constitutionality of the statutes. Moreover, plaintiffs should be given the opportunity to submit evidence within the scope, and in support of, the allegations of their bill, so that it may be determined as a question of fact whether, in truth, they have the right to assail the challenged statutes.

The court also found chs. 22316, and 23325 void and not new or independent enactments because the statute's title gave no indication of the main purpose of the act, and was misleading.

The supreme court partially affirmed and partially reversed the trial court decision. Appellee refused to account for a sales transaction pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 596.11 (1941) as required under its fruit dealing license. Appellee's license was contingent upon him having a good reputation for payment of debts and his ability to pay past and future debts. Appellee's failure to discharge appellant's debt to the extent that appellee underpaid appellant for boxes of fruit was a violation of his responsibility under Fla. Stat. ch. 596.11 (1941). The supreme court recalculated the amount appellee was required to pay appellant in order to keep its license based on the proportion of fruits picked and paid for versus an amount appellee previously advanced appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant adjacent landowners filed a petition for interlocutory writ of certiorari after the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County (Florida) denied their motion for an order transferring the action filed by plaintiff landowner to the law side of the trial court, or to award a judgment trial, or to dismiss the cause. Plaintiff had filed a bill of complaint in equity to quiet title to his land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that defendants were claiming land owned by plaintiff. The boundaries of the tracts owned by the parties and title thereto were in dispute. Defendants alleged that the trial should have been transferred to the law side of the trial court and a jury trial awarded the parties. The constitutional right of trial by jury was not challenged, and plaintiff claimed that defendants had waived the right of a trial by jury. Upon consideration, the court held that defendants were in possession of the land in question. The court noted that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66.16 provided a remedy for the quieting of title to land in a court of equity but that if a defendant or any of them in such a case was in the actual possession of any part of the land involved, a trial by a jury could be demanded. The court indicated that upon the demand the trial court was to order the cause to be docketed on the law side of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner town appealed from the decree of the Duval County Circuit Court (Florida), which dismissed its petition to validate the issuance of bonds to construct a water supply and distribution system that had been approved in an election by a majority of the qualified elector freeholders, who voted. Appeal was predicated on the ground that bond election was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner town published notices of registration for an election to determine whether or not it should issue bonds for the construction of a municipal water supply and distribution system. The election was held seven days after the registration books were closed. Although the town charter appeared to impose additional qualifications for voters than those required by Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6, petitioner did not enforce the town charter requirements and no one was denied the right to vote on that basis. The bond issue passed by a majority of the qualified elector freeholders who voted, so petitioner applied to the circuit court to validate the issuance of bonds. Respondent state objected, claiming the election was invalid. The petition was dismissed and petitioner appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that denial of validation was improper because the election was valid. Petitioner complied with the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 103.02 (1941) with respect to publication of notices. Moreover, the additional qualifications in the town charter may have been unconstitutional, but no one was actually prejudiced or denied the vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decree dismissing petitioner's validation petition was reversed because the election was valid; petitioner properly published notices of the election and registration for the length of time and substantially in the form required by statute, and while the town charter allegedly imposed unconstitutional additional qualifications on those who could vote, no one was actually denied the right to vote because of those added requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power company argued, inter alia, that 1947 Fla. Laws ch. 24815 was unconstitutional because it unlawfully provided for the expenditure of county tax money for an object which was not a proper county purpose. The utility board had been awarded money by the county to cover the board's costs and expenses. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the power company's complaint. The legislative purpose of the statute was to prevent excessive rates or charges for electric current to the county residents. The state legislature authorized the counties to impose taxes for county purposes. What was a county purpose could be determined by the express or implied provisions of a statute, and the courts would not interfere with that determination unless it had no legal or practical relation to a valid county purpose. Therefore, the statute made the money raised by taxation and used by the county a county purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant served a sentence after he pled guilty to driving while intoxicated and reckless driving. Appellant was subsequently charged with manslaughter arising out of the same incident and the court reversed the trial court's order quashing the information on the ground of double jeopardy. After appellant was convicted the court affirmed the judgment. The issue of double jeopardy was disposed of by the earlier appeal to the court, which ruled that appellant had not proven the essentials of former double jeopardy. Appellant also argued that he was denied an impartial jury because of the exclusion of all female citizens from the panel and requested the court to hold Fla. Stat. ch. 40.01(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court found that appellant had not been denied due process by reason of the exclusions of females from the jury and that appellant received a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment finding appellant guilty of manslaughter.

Appellants' lands were annexed into the city limits when the town was promoted to a city in 1925. However, the court later ordered a judgment of ouster against the city from the entire added area. Appellants asserted that their lands were by nature rural, had not been improved, and had received no municipal benefits. The court noted that it was not concerned with a suit to exclude property from the city because the property had already been excluded when the act incorporating it was held unconstitutional. However, the court noted that the tax at issue was not for services furnished by the city but for the retirement of bonds. The court held that appellants were correct in their contention that some of their property was outside the territory defined by the lower court and held that concerning property in that category, appellants should be allowed to apply to the lower court for a final decree determining their rights. The court affirmed the remainder of the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed on the grounds that the legislative act was constitutional. The legislature was the policy making authority and the courts were expected to heed a declaration like this unless clearly shown to have been promulgated without power to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee domestic relations judge determined that appellant was the father of an illegitimate child and ordered appellant to pay support. Appellant petitioned for a writ of prohibition, contending that appellee did not have jurisdiction to make such orders. The circuit court granted appellee's motion to quash and to dismiss the petition. On appeal, the court reversed. The provision of the statute ordering the domestic relations court to investigate paternity matters and to make support orders was unconstitutional because it was a special law regulating the practice of the courts of justice and did not concern any enumerated exception within Fla.

It was also suggested that the appeal was moot by virtue of the enactment of 1947 Fla. Laws ch. 23740. On appeal, the court affirmed the order below. The court held that the bill of complaint stated no grounds for relief because the legislature had the power to enact the tax, and there was no showing that the tax was so discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive as to amount to denial of due process, equal protection, or other constitutional property right of plaintiff. However, the court did hold that the enactment of ch. 23740 did not have the effect of rendering plaintiff's appeal moot because the law exempting stamp vending machines from the disputed tax did not apply to taxes already due and payable.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that a state agency could have performed official acts throughout the state and it may have been amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts were the official acts have been performed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a mandamus proceeding brought by relator state and others against respondent governor and other, relators sought to enforce the payment of taxes on land occupied by an agricultural experiment station located within the South Florida Conservancy District. The court held that the state had the right, by positive legislative enactment, to declare that its own property could be assessed for local improvements. The constitutional tax exemption of that property did not prevent the legislature from making a declaration that the property was subject to local tax assessments. The court held that there was no reason why the other landowners of the district should bear the burden of paying for the benefits derived by the agricultural experiment station simply because the title to the land was held by the State Board of Education. The people, having spoken through the legislature, expressed themselves that the landowners in the South Florida Conservancy District should not be so burdened. Because property owned for public purposes could not be sold to satisfy the lien of a tax assessment, it was appropriate for the assessment to be enforced by proceedings in mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged a final decree validating the issuance of revenue bonds by appellee state agency and approving the bond liquidation plan in accordance with 1947 Fla. Laws ch. 23748 and Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 16. The bonds would be issued to finance road construction connecting state highways in the applicant county. To procure revenues to pay the principal and interest on the bonds and to defray costs incurred in connection with their issuance, appellee entered into a contract with the State Road Department (Department), whereby the Department would lease and purchase the road for a sum sufficient to meet all bond requirements, using surplus gas taxes accruing to the credit of the particular county. The question upon appeal was whether the statute allowing appellee's pledge of rentals received to pay bonds and the Department's lease-purchase of the road with surplus gas tax revenues in the future for county road construction was constitutional. The court affirmed the decision. Future surplus gas tax proceeds held in trust for counties did not constitute state funds and, where pledged to service bonds payable in the future, did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney general sought to intervene in a private suit brought to quiet title to certain property. Although the trial court denied petitioner's motion to intervene, petitioner filed responsive pleadings and a motion to dismiss. Respondent trustees, defendants in the underlying title action, filed a motion to strike petitioner's pleadings. The motion to strike was granted and petitioner appealed, seeking a writ of certiorari. The court held that although petitioner could intervene in private suits under Fla. Stat. ch. 87.10 (1941), petitioner could not intervene in cases where the rights of the state or welfare of the people were not involved. Further, the statute did not require petitioner to be joined as a necessary party in all cases in which it sought to intervene, but did require that petitioner had to be heard. The court held that the trial court heard petitioner during his motion to intervene. Petitioner, who was not statutorily entitled to intervene in the suit, could not ignore the denial of the intervention motion. The court thus affirmed the order striking petitioner's pleadings and denied petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney general's request for a writ of certiorari was denied and the order striking petitioner's pleadings affirmed, because petitioner did not have statutory authority to intervene in private suits, but only had authority to be heard in such suits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee constable filed a petition for declaratory judgment to declare 1945 Fla. Special Act ch. 23249, abolishing existing justice districts, unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 21. After the judgment was granted, appellant state attorney sought review. The court held that in interpreting repeals, amendments and modifications of organic provisions, such actions only came in conflict when they were positively and irreconcilably repugnant to each other and then only to the extent of their repugnancy. Conflicting provisions of the constitution were repugnant only when they related to the same subject, were adopted for the same purpose, and could not enforced without substantial conflict. The court held the changes in Fla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 21, evinced the intent to completely revise the fundamental law governing the establishment of justice districts and the fixing of their boundaries. The effect of the amendment was to vest in the legislature the power to determine, by special act, the boundaries and number of justice districts existing at the time of the required special act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a justice of the peace, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Duval County (Florida), which quashed appellant's alternative writ of mandamus that would have compelled appellees, county commissioners, to approve appellant's costs for conducting a coroner's inquest into the cause of death of an individual who died under suspicious circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, county commissioners, argued, and the trial court agreed, that appellant, a justice of the peace, was not entitled to be reimbursed for the costs associated with conducting an inquest into the cause of death of an individual whose death was not likely due to natural causes. Specifically, appellees contended, appellant conducted the inquest without first obtaining direction from a judge or prosecuting attorney of a court having jurisdiction of felonies committed in the county, as required by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 946.03. The court agreed, pointing first to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 22, which authorized justices of the peace to conduct inquests, and then to &sect; 936.03, which was to be strictly construed, requiring that a copy of the direction be attached to any cost bill before payment be made. Public officers, the court ruled, could make no claim for services rendered, except when compensation was provided by law; otherwise, the service was gratuitous. The court concluded that inquests were public services, to be paid for by the public, and were not intended to serve private interests. Thus, appellant should have satisfied conditions precedent for conducting an inquest for pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed denying appellant justice of the peace his costs for conducting a coroner's inquest into the cause of death of an individual who died under suspicious circumstances, because statutory condition precedent for conducting an inquest -- that a judge or prosecuting attorney direct appellant to proceed -- was not satisfied, and because inquests were services paid by the public and were not intended to serve private interests.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision which granted a final declaratory judgment in favor of appellee but reversed as to that part of the judgment which declared that appellant had an exclusive right to furnish cablevision services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father asserted release and settlement as an affirmative defense to appellee mother's paternity action. Appellant's affirmative defenses were based upon a written agreement, which settled a previous paternity action and that had been signed by appellee. The trial court struck the affirmative defenses and held that although the parties intended that the agreement would release all their rights, including the child's right to future support, the agreement did not affect the rights of the child. The court affirmed the order to strike the affirmative defenses. The court held that appellant was obligated to provide support to the child. The court observed that an illegitimate child's right to support from its putative father could not be contracted away by its mother. The court held that appellee's attempt to release appellant from his child support obligations was invalid. The court rejected appellant's analogy to cases that held that a putative father had no standing to prevent abortion of a fetus by stating that abortion issues were separate from issues involving the property rights of unborn children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued appellees city and judge, charging appellee judge with negligence, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution and seeking to charge appellee city with the claims based upon the theory of respondeat superior. After the trial court dismissed his suit, appellant sought review. On appeal, the issue was whether appellee judge was immune from suit. The court affirmed dismissal of appellant's suit. The doctrine of judicial immunity applied to appellee judge, and appellee city was protected because a municipality had sovereign immunity regarding the judicial or quasi-judicial acts of its officials. The public policy underlying the judicial immunity doctrine was obvious. Without such immunity, all judges' decisions could be collaterally attacked in suits brought against them and the finality of judicial decisions would be impaired. Further, without judicial immunity, there would certainly be a chilling effect upon the independent decision making role of the judiciary and upon the willingness of qualified individuals to serve in judicial positions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with loitering that hindered or impeded the passage of pedestrians or vehicles in violation of a local ordinance. At the trial before the municipal court, petitioner challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance under U.S. Const. amend. XIV; however, he was convicted. The circuit court affirmed petitioner's conviction, and petitioner requested a writ of certiorari. The court granted the petition and quashed the conviction. A law denied due process if it was so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence was not put on notice of the conduct which was prohibited or if the law was so overbroad that it made common conduct criminal and provided the police with unfettered discretion to arrest. If a loitering statute proscribed loitering or idling without more, it was unconstitutional under this standard. However, if it proscribed loitering that threatened public safety or a breach of the peace, the law could withstand constitutional attack. The ordinance here contained no restrictive standards that limited its application to impediments that threatened public safety or breach of the peace. Therefore, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party and defendant automobile driver were involved in an accident. At the conclusion of all the testimony, plaintiff made a motion for a directed verdict on liability that was granted. The trial court allowed the issue of plaintiff's comparative negligence to be tried by the jury and plaintiff appealed that decision. The trial court also denied defendant's motion for taxation of costs and found that Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442 was discretionary. Defendant appealed that decision. The court affirmed the trial court's submission of plaintiff's comparative negligence to the jury. The court held that the issue of plaintiff's negligence was properly permitted to go to the jury even though defendant's negligence had been taken away from the jury because the trial court determined that defendant was negligent, not that he was solely negligent, and the jury was properly instructed. The court reversed the trial court's decision that denied defendant taxation of costs and determined that Rule 1.442 was not discretionary, but instead was mandatory when defendant made an offer to plaintiff that was rejected and plaintiff obtained a judgment that was less than defendant's offer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an appeal from the decision of the trial court, which denied his motion to vacate judgment and expunge record in which he asserted under oath that at the time of the entry of the judgment and sentence he was a youth of 20 years of age, uneducated in the law and without any funds with which to obtain legal assistance in his defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court. The appellant was adjudged guilty of grand larceny. Later, he filed a motion to vacate judgment and expunge record and asserted that at the time of the entry of the judgment and sentence he was a youth of 20 years of age, and without any funds with which to obtain legal assistance. The appellant swore that the trial court failed to ascertain his financial condition and failed to advise him that as an indigent the trial court would provide him legal counsel. The trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. The court held that an indigent person was entitled to have counsel appointed for him by the state in felony prosecutions. The court found that the only arguable point on the appeal was whether the appellant was entitled to seek relief in view of the fact that his sentence had long since expired and he was no longer in custody. The court determined that the appellant's motion should be treated as an application for a writ of coram nobis. The case was remanded with directions to hold an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court which denied the appellant's motion to vacate judgment and expunge record because while a person in custody normally had a more vital interest in seeking to void his judgment and sentence, the stigma and disabilities incident to a felony conviction continue to be substantial detriments even after the sentence was served.</SPAN></P>

Although petitioner was a better producer and all other factors being equal, tracks with records as best producers of revenue should prevail unless strong, compelling reasons otherwise dictated, the court denied the petition because there was substantial evidence to support respondent board's concern that respondent track might close if it did not receive those favorable dates, which would be a shocking economic blow to a major Florida industry affected with a public interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of nine violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011(1)(a), which allegedly occurred on three different dates during 1970-1971. On appeal, the court found, without discussion, that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011(1)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague at the time of the 1970 offenses and that appellant's claim, that the state had effectively commented that appellant had failed to testify, was without merit. The court further found that, pursuant to ch. 847.011(4), appellant's convictions of identical offenses committed on consecutive days was not a single, continuous violation and therefore the separate convictions, under the statute, were proper. In addition, the court ruled that the issue of dual punishment for different facets of the same crime was not presented but that appellant's two convictions for advertising the same obscene film were improper, because appellant's offense consisted of a single act of procuring the advertisement. The court also remanded the question as to whether appellant was entitled to discharge under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191, because he was brought to trial after the 90-day period for misdemeanor offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed one conviction, finding that appellant's separate convictions under the statute for various obscenity crimes committed on consecutive days were proper, modified a second conviction, finding that the two convictions for advertising the same obscene film on consecutive days were improper, and remanded a third conviction, because it was not clear whether the state violated the speedy trial rule.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant had been dismissed from teaching by appellee school board for committing immoral conduct with his nine year old stepdaughter. Because the court found the term immorality sufficiently clear to designate the actionable misconduct and incapable of further definition, the court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 231.36(6) was not void for vagueness. The court found that appellant's immoral act was indirectly related to his job and pertained to his fitness to teach children so that his immoral acts were related to his job performance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owner held land with sinkholes, bisected by a power line, and zoned agricultural. Appellee applied for a change of zoning to low density multifamily apartments. Appellant board of county commissioners denied the application, and appellee filed suit. The trial judge withheld his ruling, advising that he thought a planned unit development (PUD) was the most appropriate use. Thereafter, appellant board rezoned for a PUD and appellee moved to set PUD zoning aside. The lower court ruled that agricultural or single family zoning was inappropriate, enjoined appellants from enforcing the PUD, and ordered rezoning to a more liberal classification. On appeal, the court held that the arbitrary and unreasonable application of the zoning classification sought by appellants was not fairly debatable. In affirming, the court held that the trial judge did not misapply the fairly debatable rule and that the final judgment was not only well grounded in the law, but also the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellants' first complaint was dismissed, as was their second, nearly identical, one. The court held that appellants' claims for malicious interference with business and libel were a single cause of action. The court also held that appellants failed to state a claim because they did not notify appellees, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 770.01, before commencing their libel action. The court affirmed because appellants' cause of action did not exist before they commenced their action, and appellants could not cure their failure to notify appellees as required by statute by amending the complaint to include an event that occurred after the complaint was filed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 933.06 might be construed to permit the issuance of a search warrant based upon an affidavit which did not in and of itself demonstrate probable cause for the issuance of the warrant, it was unconstitutional as being in violation of the state constitution. The court noted that the affidavit was not a model, but it sufficiently supported the issuance of a search warrant for the vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city owned and operated a municipal water sewer company. Appellee, county and its water and sewer board, sought to consider a temporary ban on further connections to appellant's municipal water system. Appellant filed suit seeking an injunction against appellee to prevent the consideration of the proposed temporary ban. The trial court denied appellant's injunction request. Appellant contended that appellee was without statutory authority to interfere with a municipally-operated water system within the county and only the state division of health had exclusive jurisdiction. The court affirmed the denial of the injunction holding that municipal water plants were not exempt from regulation by a county in matters which were county-wide in scope. Appellee was not seeking to override state authority, it was simply exercising its authority to regulate on a county-wide basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prepared an affidavit of insolvency and was thereby appointed a public defender after she was charged with possession of cannabis and misconduct. On the prepared affidavit form, it stated that the trial court had authority to execute a lien on real or personal property as security for the debt created by services rendered by the public defendant and that defendant waived her right to notice of any proceedings at which the value of those services would be determined. Thereafter, defendant pled guilty, and she was placed on probation. The probation order directed reimbursement in a certain amount for the public defender's services. Defendant sought review, and the court reversed with directions to eliminate the order for reimbursement. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56(3), defendant was entitled to a notice of hearing on the question of the amount of the lien or debt imposed for the receipt of the public defender's services. Therefore, that part of the affidavit waiving defendant's right to notice was unconstitutional, and any order of reimbursement of an amount determined without notice to defendant was improper.</SPAN></P>

Fla. Stat. ch. 48.183 (1973), which provided for the service of process made on appellants by posting on the property, was constitutional because the matter of acquiring jurisdiction over the person in a judicial proceeding was a proper subject for legislative action. The court affirmed the summary procedure by which default and final judgment were entered. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.010 provided that the procedure in all special statutory proceedings should be as prescribed by such statutes, unless the rules of civil procedure specifically provided to the contrary. Fla. Stat. ch. 83.59(2) (1973), pursuant to which plaintiff used the summary procedure set out in Fla. Stat. ch. 51.011 (1971), was a special statutory proceeding.
