</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bookstore challenged a decision of the County of Summit Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which entered a finding that certain materials sold by the bookstore were obscene and that the bookstore was, therefore, a common law public nuisance. The trial court found in favor of appellee city and permanently enjoined the sale, display, or exhibition of obscene items as well as entered an abatement order closing the rear portion of the store.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rear section of the bookstore displayed for sale sexually-oriented materials including films, dildoes, vibrators, and inflatable dolls. On appeal, the bookstore argued that the trial court erred in finding certain materials obscene, in the absence of a thorough review and examination by the trial court of each of the materials to be enjoined, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court agreed and modified the injunction and the abatement order. In doing so, the court held (1) that the trial court could not have enjoined as obscene those materials of which it made a cursory review and examination; (2) that because the city's employees were business invitees acting a manner consistent with being customers in compiling a list of materials from items on display, such action did not constitute a search contemplated by the Fourth Amendment; (3) that Tallmadge, Ohio Ordinance &sect; 34-1979 was not a bill of attainder because it imposed no penalty or punishment on the bookstore without a judicial trial; and (4) that any complete closing of a business for past sales of obscene material constituted an illegal prior restraint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the injunction to include only those exhibits that were properly reviewed by the trial court. As modified, the injunction was affirmed. The court also modified the abatement order to prohibit the bookstore from using the rear section of the store for the exhibition, display or sale of materials that displayed or depicted sexual activity that was obscene. As modified, the abatement order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating municipality's gun registration ordinance. He appeared pro se before a judge, and agreed to plead guilty. The judge rejected defendant's proposed plea, and found the ordinance in question unconstitutionally vague. Municipality appealed. The court reversed and remanded. With respect to municipality's claim that defendant's guilty plea precluded a finding of unconstitutionality, the court held that the judge was authorized to reject that plea, and in this case that was proper since defendant was pro se, claimed to be indigent, and was facing confinement; those circumstances suggested that counsel should have been provided (or at least an indigency hearing held). However, the judge erred in holding the ordinance void for vagueness of its face, as that issue had already been resolved in favor of the statute by an appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The city commission's determination that the electrical code violations constituted a hazard to public life and safety, and was the functional equivalent of a nuisance. No person had a property right to maintain a nuisance, the property, which was sustained as a nuisance, was exempt from the Ohio Const. art II, &sect; 28 prohibition against retroactive legislation. The property owners failed to present any evidence that only existing dwellings being sold were made to comply with the electrical requirements. The code was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, as the board was authorized to promulgate the code in an effort to execute the legislative intent to establish certain minimum safety standards for existing buildings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, patient and his wife, appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted summary judgment for defendants, doctor and hospital, in plaintiffs' action for damages caused by defendants' alleged negligence in prescribing and administering radiation treatment. They argued that their action was not barred by the statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11, and that &sect; 2305.11 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient underwent radiation treatments under the doctor's care. After his last treatment, he saw the doctor for follow-up visits for another two years. Months later, the wife became concerned that the patient was mentally incompetent. Plaintiffs claimed that the patient's mental condition was caused by excessive radiation exposure. They filed their action nearly two years after the patient's final visit with the doctor, and five years after the final radiation treatment was administered at the hospital. The trial court ruled that because plaintiffs failed to file their action within one year of the date of accrual, the action was barred by &sect; 2305.11. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly found that the action accrued on the date of the patient's final visit. The court further ruled that the action was not tolled by the &quot;foreign objects&quot; exception because radiation did not qualify as such. The court concluded that &sect; 2305.11 was not unconstitutional because the limitations period was rationally related to reduce problems inherent in malpractice actions and thus, furthered the legislature's legitimate goals of providing stability and repose for such claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled plaintiffs' assignments of error and affirmed the trial court's judgment, which entered in favor of the doctor and the hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property was in an area zoned H-B (Highway Business), a designation permitting the construction of apartment buildings that contained more than two living units.

The City Council rezoned the property to Residence R-3 by adopting Ordinance No. 5101 and denied the building permit. The owners sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court declared the zoning ordinance unconstitutional and directed issuance of the building permit. In affirming on appeal, the court held that the zoning ordinance failed to meet the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.30 because it did not state the reasons for the enactment of the emergency legislation. Thus, Lebanon, Ohio, Ordinance No. 5101 was invalid as an emergency enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city official challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Ohio), which dismissed his action against appellee city manager for wrongful termination pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01 et seq. The issues included whether the trial court had jurisdiction to review the city manager's actions under either statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city official was dismissed by the city manager without a hearing or apparent reason. The official's action before the trial court was dismissed, and he sought review. The court held that the state courts of common pleas had no jurisdiction to hear a case under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court also held that pursuant to the city charter, the city manager had every authority to summarily discharge the official and that it was not necessary for him to state a reason in support of his action. Neither was the position with the city a &quot;property right&quot; protected by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and thus there was no need for the city manager to conduct a hearing or engage in any form of procedural due process before dismissing the official. The court held that because no cause was needed to dismiss the official, the city manger's alleged illegal reasons for the dismissal were not relevant. If the dismissal was for truly discriminatory reasons, a &sect; 1983 action could be filed in federal court. Finally, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01 et seq. only permitted judicial review of the quasi-judicial actions of administrative officers or agencies, not their discretionary actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's property fronted a road that on the landowner's side was zoned residential, but on the opposite side and under another city's jurisdiction was zoned for commercial use.

But the city's board of trustee's reversed that decision and the zoning inspector denied the necessary permits. The landowner sought judicial review, the trial court reversed the board, and then the board appealed the trial court. The court held that to restrict the particular parcel to residential while all the land around it was already being commercially developed was arbitrary, discriminatory, confiscatory, and served no valid purpose on behalf of the general welfare. Any concerns regarding increased traffic had to be secondary to the right of the landowner to use his property to best and most profitable use he could consistent with the land's location. The city could not use its zoning power to control the business conduct of individual members of the public at large, especially where similar parcels had been zoned for commercial use.</SPAN></P>

After an evidentiary hearing, the Commission affirmed the removal. The trial court, stating that it viewed the evidence as sufficient to support the grounds of removal from an evidentiary standpoint, reversed the Commission's order because the penalty was too harsh under the circumstances. The court rejected the mayor's argument that the trial court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing. The trial court was limited to the transcript because no affidavit was filed asserting any condition allowing the introduction of additional evidence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03 and no such condition existed on the face of the record. The court found that the trial court's order was contrary to law because it did not confine itself to the scope of review authorized by law. The trial court, although not so articulated, based its reversal upon an abuse of discretion as to the appropriate penalty. Under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, and over defendant's objection, the trial court admitted into evidence a certified copy of an order in a previous dependency action that mandated defendant to pay child support and a copy of court records showing that defendant had not made any support payments. Defendant contended that the record of judgment in the civil action was not admissible in his criminal trial to establish facts necessary to his conviction and that &sect; 2919.21(A)(4) was unconstitutional. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. In so holding, the court found that: (1) no authority prohibited the use of the court order arising out of a civil dependency action to establish that the minor child was a person whom by court order defendant was legally obligated to support; (2) the State was still left with the burden of proving, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21(A), that defendant failed to provide adequate support for the child, which involved proof of the need of support from defendant; and (4) defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 2919.21(A)(4) on appeal by failing to raise the issue in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural father's wife sought to adopt the child of the natural father and the natural mother. The probate court allowed the adoption. The natural mother appealed citing that: (1) the probate court erred in finding that consent of the natural mother was not required, (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3107.07(A) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and (3) the probate court erred by considering the best interest of the child when making its determination of whether the natural mother's consent to the adoption was required. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that since the constitutionality of &sect; 3107.07(A) was not raised in the probate court it could not be raised on appeal. Section 3107.07(A) stated that a parent's consent to an adoption was not necessary when that parent failed to communicate or provide support to the child for one year without a justifiable cause. The court found that there was no justifiable cause for the fact that only some isolated contact had occurred between the child and the natural mother and that last visit was more than two years prior to the filing of the petition. The court noted that probate court's action was justified.</SPAN></P>

At issue was the trial court's exclusion under the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.25 of a letter written by defendant to the reviewing committee that handled plaintiff's application for hospital staff privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hospital screening committee member argued in the trial court that plaintiff doctor's libel action was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2305.251, a privilege statute. Plaintiff had sought, and was denied, staff privileges at a hospital, and defendant had mailed a letter to the hospital's chief of staff, at his request, which was the subject of the lawsuit. The letter had become part of the record and hearing in which staff privileges were denied. In the trial court proceedings, the parties stipulated that the admissibility or inadmissibility of the alleged libelous letter involved in the case would be presented, and in the event that the trial court granted defendant's motion in limine, final judgment could then be entered by the trial court accordingly. The motion in limine was granted and the action was dismissed. On appeal the judgment was affirmed. The court found that the letter was privileged under &sect; 2305.251, the statutory reach of &sect; 2305.251 included libel actions, the privilege cited by &sect; 2305.251 was not waived because plaintiff was given the subject letter prior to the hearing, and plaintiff's constitutionality challenge to &sect; 2305.251 was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court judgment that dismissed plaintiff doctor's libel action against defendant hospital screening committee member was affirmed, and the case was remanded for execution of judgment.

Where the parties had agreed that the letter was dispositive of the controlling issue of liability, the action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping, he appealed. On appeal, the court held that the warrantless arrest of defendant inside his home was not illegal or unconstitutional. Defendant's arrest followed a connected chain of events that began with a robbery and ended with his identification and apprehension. The court found that while police officers were not technically in hot pursuit of defendant, there was the possibility that defendant could have escaped or destroyed evidence before a warrant could have been secured. Therefore, the court determined that exigent circumstances existed that justified the warrantless arrest. The court stated that the impoundment and search of defendant's car was done pursuant to a valid arrest and was done with defendant's consent and was, therefore, also proper. The court found that photographs of the victim were admissible to substantiate oral testimony given at trial. The court concluded that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to quash and dismiss the indictment, resulting in a violation of defendant's rights under Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate brought an action against the department officials claiming that their policies governing inmate funds violated his constitutional rights. The policies prohibited an inmate from receiving funds from any source not on his approved visiting list, a government agency, or other source authorized by the institution's managing officer, and they provided for confiscation of funds in certain circumstances. The trial court granted the officials' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted based on Ohio statutory law. On appeal, the court held that the inmate had stated constitutional claims that the trial court had not considered, and thus the action should not have been dismissed. Further, the court disagreed with the trial court's assertion that there was no actual case or controversy between the parties because it held that the allegations in the complaint were broad enough, yet specific enough, to permit proof of facts tending to show that the officials actively deprived the inmate of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant's warrantless arrest was not unconstitutional. The court noted that the rape victim had identified defendant to the police and had taken them to the scene of the crime as well as to the murder victim's body. The court found that the commission of a violent crime, together with trustworthy information from the victim was sufficient to justify the warrantless arrest. Defendant was arrested on a Sunday and indicted and arraigned on the following day, the first day on which the courts were open after his arrest. The court determined, therefore that the delay did not constitute an unnecessary delay justifying the suppression of his statements given during that period. The court stated that the rape victim's identification of defendant immediately following his arrest was not impermissibly suggestive because she knew defendant and had given police his name and a description of him immediately after the incident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the loitering statute was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.

The court held that the law was valid and sufficiently definite. Furthermore, the law did not violate defendant's right to assemble because it did not deny the right of assembly in a capricious or discriminatory manner. The court found that such legislation was authorized through the legitimate use of its police powers, such as the safety of the city's streets, pedestrians, and drivers.

Police supervision authorized their arrest without a warrant based on the information provided, and a jury found them guilty. On appeal, the court reversed the perjury charges because a conviction pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.11(A) required proof that the knowing false statements were made under oath in an &quot;official proceeding.&quot; The statements made, while made under oath before a notary public, were not made as a part of an official proceeding. The arrests were properly made on probable cause and a warrant was not necessary. The trial court's admission of their statements was proper where the trial court found that they were voluntary and made with a purpose of trying to explain their behavior. The defendant who denied involvement was not entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment because entrapment assumed involvement in the crime. Sufficient evidence supported the bribery convictions.

Also, defendant failed to object to the trial court's jury instruction, which, even though it shifted the burden of proof to defendant regarding his affirmative defense of intoxication, the instruction did not constitute plain error under Ohio R. Crim. P. 52(B). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A), which shifted the burden of proof of affirmative defenses, was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a complaint, the child was found to be neglected and temporary custody was awarded to the board. That award was terminated and then later reinstated on a motion by the board without notice to the mother. The mother then filed a petition to restore custody of the child to her, however, the trial court found it not in the child's best interests for the mother to have custody and ordered such custody to remain with the board permanently. On appeal, the court held that the mother's allegation challenging the sufficiency of the board's complaint was without merit. The court found that the complaint stated the essential facts necessary to invoke subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court over the complaint. The court stated that, for the purposes of establishing subject matter jurisdiction, the furnishing of the name and address of the child's guardian was merely directory. The court also noted that the failure to serve summons on the guardian did not involve an issue of jurisdiction over a necessary person. The court concluded, furthermore, that the issue of service to the guardian had been waived because neither the mother nor the guardian had raised it at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. It held that an error or omission in the summons was not a sufficient ground for dismissal because the attached indictment had the correct information and there was no indication that defendant was misled by the error. There was no error in the admission of a forensic laboratory report without the analyst's presence because defendant had not renewed his request for the analyst's presence, after the dismissal of the first indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered a work-related injury and received a benefit determination that he had a compensable permanent, partial disability.

The employer and its insurer argued that the trial court's denial of the employee's motion to dismiss was not a final appealable order. On appeal, the court agreed, and dismissed the employee's appeal, concluding that the decision from the trial court was not a final order on the issue of jurisdiction since jurisdiction could be challenged at any time during the course of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was one of several men who had sexual relations with a young woman intoxicated by drugs and alcohol.

Affirming, the court held that the jury obviously believed the victim's testimony. After reading the entire record, the court concluded that the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court rejected defendant's contention that a lower standard of proof for the felony of rape than for the misdemeanor of sexual imposition constituted a denial of his due process and equal protection rights. The court held that the prosecutor properly followed the procedure for impeaching his own witness. He then commented in his closing argument that calling this witness was &quot;a mistake.&quot; The court held that any error in the impeachment process or the comments was not prejudicial to defendant pursuant to Ohio R.

The zoning inspector approved the permit as requested, but the permit was appealed to the board of zoning appeals by an adjacent property owner. The board of zoning appeals modified the permit to allow the operation of a waste collection business and deny the proposed waste transfer station. The common pleas court affirmed. The hauling company timely appealed, and the court affirmed the common pleas court, holding that the board of zoning appeal's resolutions and map constituted a valid comprehensive plan as contemplated under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.02. The hauling company's claim that the zoning resolutions were unconstitutional as applied to it were without merit because it could not meet the burden of showing that the invalidity of the legislation was plain, apparent, and beyond fair debate. The proposed transfer terminal was not a permitted use under the zoning resolution, and compacting the refuse to reduce its size was also prohibited.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with purposely soliciting or procuring another person to commit arson.

The trial court found that any statement made before the marriage would be admitted. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting his wife's statements into evidence. The court affirmed, holding that the spousal privilege did not apply to the statements because they were not a communication between the husband and wife during coverture, they were a communication between a spouse-to-be and a third person, which was overheard by a spouse-to-be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant forced a police detective in an unmarked car off the road. The detective called for assistance and followed defendant, who continued to drive erratically. Defendant alleged that he was attempting to repair some tangled wires under his car's instrument panel. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of his arrest. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in admitting the results of a breathalyzer test into evidence and in charging the jury. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions and that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence or in charging the jury. Both police officers testified that defendant smelled of alcohol, had difficulty walking, and was belligerent towards the officers. The arresting officer was the detective that defendant forced off the road. The breathalyzer test results showed .20 on the breathalyzer scale. The State sufficiently established a basis for the introduction of the breathalyzer test results into evidence. The trial court properly instructed the jury that the breathalyzer test results raised a presumption of being under the influence, but that the presumption was rebuttable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his companion were offered the opportunity to plead guilty of breaking and entering or face the risk of the grand jury considering the element of occupancy and issuing indictments on the greater charge of aggravated burglary. Defendant's companion pled guilty to breaking and entering while defendant refused. The grand jury found that the premises was an occupied dwelling and indicted defendant for aggravated burglary. Defendant argued that it was error for the trial judge to instruct the jury on aiding and abetting an aggravated burglary when the principal, his companion, was indicted for a different substantive offense. In affirming the conviction, the court held that it was not error for the trial judge to instruct the jury on defendant's complicity because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's companion committed the offense of aggravated burglary. The court stated that aiding and abetting was a substantive and independent offense; consequently, aiders and abettors could be prosecuted and convicted as principals without the trial or conviction of the principal offender.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Ohio R. Juv.

The juvenile court's order was detailed and specific and enumerated the investigation findings including that defendant was 15 years old and that the victim was a 78-year-old woman, as well as defendant's mental and physical health, prior juvenile record, prior efforts toward rehabilitation, family environment, and school record. Defendant alleged that he was illegally required to take a polygraph test and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress certain statements to the police and his confession. The court held that defendant's statements were voluntary and that he voluntarily submitted to the polygraph test. Defendant was repeatedly read his rights prior to the polygraph test and prior to any interrogations or statements. Defendant voluntarily confessed to an assistant prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1948, the mental patient was found incompetent to stand trial on a first-degree murder charge and committed to the state mental hospital. Pursuant to emergency legislation passed in 1975, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.381, the mental patient returned to the trial court for a competency hearing. The trial court declared him incompetent and certified him to the probate division, which civilly committed him to a state hospital. After &sect; 2945.381 was repealed, the mental patient filed a motion for a competency hearing, which the trial court denied. The mental patient sought review and filed a mandamus petition against the State. The court reversed the denial of the motion and denied the petition for mandamus. First, the court held that the denial of the motion was a final appealable order. Second, the court noted that the repealing legislation completely restructured the procedures relating to trial competency. Because the new scheme completely replaced the old one, the court said, the old procedures were no longer in existence and a person could no longer have been held under them. Therefore, the court ruled that the mental patient was entitled to a new competency hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the section of the ordinance relating to a crime was at the conclusion of Chapter 867 and was not separated or hidden from the other provisions within the chapter. The court found that the provision was clear and that the practice of placing penalty provisions at the end of the chapter was common to both the Akron Ordinances and to the Ohio Revised Code. The licensing requirements were found appropriate to the health section, and a person of ordinary intelligence reading the massage parlor section would not have been required to speculate as to the nature of the acts which constituted a crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court committed prejudicial error in overruling defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence, that the statute under which defendant was indicted and found guilty was unconstitutional in that it delegated to private individuals substantive law making authority which responsibility was legislative in nature, and that the trial court committed prejudicial error by denying defendant his statutory and constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court held that movants had the burden of establishing a violation of Fourth Amendment rights before courts could grant motions to suppress. The court found that defendant presented no evidence of a Fourth Amendment violation. Indeed, defendant actually denied any packet was seized from him. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44 allowed the State Board of Pharmacy to change drugs from one schedule to another. The court held that the delegation of authority was both necessary and proper. The court found no unjust delay in commencing prosecution. And the court found that certain false name testimony was admissible as evidence showing how the packet of drugs came to the attention of the police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A pension fund filed a declaratory action to have Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 163.03 declared unconstitutional. The fund argued that the statute, which provided for administrative entry onto private land for initial survey for possible eminent domain actions, constituted a taking. The trial court rendered judgment for the department, and the fund sought review. The court affirmed. It found that the statute did not create an unconstitutional physical taking because the right to enter land did not substantially interfere with an owner's right to quiet enjoyment or disposition. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it was not so vague, uncertain, indefinite, and lacking in standards that it offended due process of law, and it was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Finally, the statute did not authorize an unconstitutional warrantless search of private property because it provided sufficient limitations and constraints upon governmental agencies that entered private land.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled the overbreadth and vagueness challenges on the basis that as &sect; 2917.12 was clear and unequivocal, it provided fair notice of what was forbidden to a person of ordinary intellect and the state supreme court's limiting construction of the statute saved it from unconstitutional overbreadth. Moreover, &sect; 2917.12 did not regulate speech, but conduct, and ample evidence supported a jury finding of guilt. However, the trial court's definition of substantial in its charge that the jury was required to find that defendant substantially interfered with the due conduct of the meeting was erroneous as it related to the strong possibility of a future result whereas &sect; 2917.12 prohibited conduct that had the immediate effect of substantial obstruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor filed a mechanic's lien on the property and sought to foreclose. The owners filed a counterclaim for breach of warranty, unfair and deceptive consumer sales practices, and fraud. The trial court referred the case to an arbitrator. The arbitrator found in favor of the contractor. The owners filed a notice of appeal de novo and filed an affidavit stating that they could not afford to pay the arbitrator's fees due to recent costly medical bills. The trial court rejected the affidavit of poverty. On appeal, the court agreed. It first held that mandatory arbitration was not a denial of due process. It next held that it was not error to reject the affidavit. There was no evidence of the owners' financial status. There was some evidence that one owner was employed. There was evidence of the property value based on the mechanic's lien. Thus, the owners could not claim poverty. However, because the owners had not been given a reasonable time to deposit the required fees, the judgment was reversed and remanded, to be reinstated only if the fees were not paid. A reasonable time to pay was within the spirit of the arbitration act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators sought to have &sect; 339.02 declared invalid insofar as it restricted their use of a designated avenue while picking up or discharging a customer's cargo. The court rejected the operators' contentions that &sect; 339.02 was vague, confusing and uncertain, and therefore invalid and that the ordinance constituted a denial of equal protection. The court observed that the fact that the alternative routes available to the operators were circuitous and that a restricted avenue was the shortest route was not sufficient to establish that the ordinance was either &quot;unduly oppressive&quot; or that it interfered with private rights beyond the necessities of the situation. Neither Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.022 nor any other provision of the Ohio Revised Code required the director of public safety to hold a public hearing prior to establishing truck routes. Moreover, Ohio's &quot;sunshine law,&quot; codified at Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 121.22, had no application to the director with respect to the establishment of truck routes within a city. The operators' contention that the director acted without obtaining evidence as to congestion of streets was unsupported by the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with trafficking a Schedule II drug in an amount equal to or greater than bulk amount. At trial, the prosecution presented evidence that defendant sold drugs to an undercover officer, and expert testimony showing that the amount possessed with intent to deliver was at least 30 times the maximum daily dose in the usual dose range specified in a standard pharmaceutical reference manual. During the jury instruction phase, the trial judge told the jurors the formula for determining bulk amount, but not the bulk amount threshold itself. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the evidence of bulk amount was sufficient, and there was no error in admitting the expert testimony on bulk amount that was presented. The court also ruled that although an instruction on the precise bulk amount threshold was preferable, merely providing the formula was not reversible error. Finally, the court held that defendant waived his claim of error regarding the lack of voir dire as to the issue of mandatory punishment, even though he had made that request, and had seen it denied, in any earlier trial that resulted in a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's argument that &sect; 4301.67 was unconstitutional owing to its being violative of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the Twenty-First Amendment trumped both of those provisions. Under the Twenty-First Amendment, the State was empowered to bar the possession of any alcohol whatsoever within its borders. It was therefore permitted to take the lesser step of barring the possession of alcohol not falling within certain categories specified by law.</SPAN></P>

When her brother again refused to turn off the television, defendant shot and killed him. Defendant was initially convicted of aggravated murder but was later granted a new trial. Defendant was then convicted of murder and sentenced accordingly. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion to suppress her statements because she was not in custody when the police entered the house. The court also found that the there was sufficient evidence of probative value upon which to support the verdict of the jury. The court determined that the trial court's refusal to charge the jury on negligent homicide as a lesser included offense was properly because all the elements of the offense were not included in the offense of murder.

The minor sought damages for personal injury. The trial court entered summary judgment on the enhancement of injury issue. Subsequently, a jury awarded the minor damages for her injuries. The lawn mower manufacturer appealed. The court remanded. The court held that the lawn mower manufacturer should have been estopped from relitigating the design issue the court improperly granted summary judgment on the enhancement of injury question, as there was a material disputed fact that required determination by the jury. The court also held that Ohio provided a limited public policy exception but generally adhered to the mutuality requirement; the general rule stated that the application of the concept of collateral estoppel required an identity of the parties and that the operation of the rule must be mutual.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge dismissed the complaint, finding no evidence of any criminal filings. The business appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the nature of the matter was such that the business could only challenge the ordinance by violating it or seeking a declaratory judgment. A declaratory judgment action was therefore permissible, as the business should not have been forced to incur criminal penalties rather than challenge the statute. There was a justiciable controversy, and therefore the dismissal of the business' lawsuit was improper.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed an answer and counterclaim based upon the common law torts of alienation of affections and criminal conversation. The Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County (Ohio) granted appellee's motion to dismiss appellant's counterclaim for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee alleged that appellant shot him repeatedly, causing him permanent injury. The trial court, finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.29 had abolished civil liability for the commission of the torts alleged in the counterclaim, entered judgment granting appellee's motion to dismiss. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in dismissing her counterclaim in that (1) the causes of action for enticement was not abolished by &sect; 2305.29; (2) &sect; 2305.29 was unconstitutional as violative of the Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16; and (3) the causes of action accrued prior to the effective date of &sect; 2305.29. The court disagreed with all three arguments. The court held that although enticement was not specifically enumerated in &sect; 2305.29, it was abolished thereby as included under the cause of action for alienation of affections. The court also held that the causes of action abolished by &sect; 2305.29 protected interests that were no longer considered to be properly recognizable at law and therefore appellant did not have a vested right in those interests. Finally, the court held that the trial court application of &sect; 2305.29 did not have a retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor treated the patient until he was eight years old. When the patient turned 18, he filed a complaint alleging that the doctor had been negligent in diagnosing and treating him. The doctor moved for summary judgment on the grounds the action had not been timely filed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11. The trial court granted the motion. The court reversed. Under &sect; 2305.11, as it read when the patient's action accrued, the patient had two years to file his malpractice action, which statute of limitations was tolled until he reached the age of majority. With the amending of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11, which required a minor under 10 years of age, as the patient was at the time his action accrued, to bring his action no later than four years after the action accrued, the patient's cause of action was destroyed. Since &sect; 2305.11 destroyed the patient's substantive right to a malpractice action, its application to the patient conflicted with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Thus, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58, the patient had two years after he reached the age of majority to file his action, and the action was filed within that time period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was given a three-day suspension from his job, and he appealed to the State Board. The State Board refused to entertain the appeal on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34, which provided that only suspensions of more than three days were appealable. The employee then appealed to the trial court on the grounds that the State Board's refusal to entertain jurisdiction deprived him of his constitutional right to equal protection. The trial court dismissed the appeal finding that it also lacked jurisdiction. The employee appealed the trial court's judgment. The court dismissed the appeal but remanded the case for further proceedings. Because the constitutionality of &sect; 124.34 was determinative of whether the State Board and the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the employee's appeal, which was denied by the statute, the trial court should have entertained jurisdiction for that purpose. As the constitutional issue was not addressed, but which should have been addressed by the trial court, the issues before the trial court were not resolved consistent with Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(B). Thus, there was no final, appealable order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of marijuana possession under Mentor, Ohio, Ord. No. 139.01. The conviction was based on a no contest plea following the denial of their motion to dismiss for unconstitutionality of the ordinance. The ordinance authorized a fine and/or 30 days in jail for marijuana possession, but a violation of the ordinance did not constitute a criminal record. Reversing and discharging defendants, the court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with the general laws of Ohio, under which possession of marijuana was a minor misdemeanor and carried no jail time. By providing jail time, the ordinance significantly changed the nature of the penalty. That the ordinance provided for jail sentence and at the same time did not constitute a criminal record did not result in its being ambiguous. Giving the prosecutor the choice between the ordinance and the state statute was not a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners received a change in the zoning classification for six of their acres for &quot;motor service&quot; use, which allowed the building of car agencies. The owners subsequently requested the same change zoning classification for its remaining 33 acres in order to accommodate the erection of car dealerships. The request was rejected by the city, which rezoned the property by limiting retail use and building height to 35 feet. The owners filed an action alleging that the city arbitrarily and unconstitutionally enforced its zoning code against the owners. After a bench trial, judgment was entered in the city's favor. The court reversed the judgment, holding that (1) the owners met their burden of proving beyond fair debate that the ordinance, as applied to the property, was arbitrary and unreasonable in that it did not further a goal that related to public health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community; (2) Ohio R. Civ. P. 15(B) permitted a trial of issues not raised by the pleadings through express or implied consent of the parties; and (3) economic loss and fair market value were proper factors to consider in determining the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board claimed that the landowner did not timely file his written notice of appeal. The court found that oral notice of the hearing did not cause the appeal period to commence running and held that the appeal was timely perfected. The court further held that the trial court's decision that the refusal of a township board of zoning appeals to grant a variance was reviewable only as to the question of the reasonableness of such decision, was erroneous, that the failure of the board to establish any substantial basis for an alleged comprehensive plan was a factor to be considered by a reviewing court, and that the evidence was more than sufficient to establish that the literal enforcement of a one-acre minimum lot size requirement would result in hardship to the landowner. The court also held that the granting of a conditional variance, properly conditioned upon water, sewer and streets being installed at lots of less than one acre prior to sale, could result in relief of unnecessary hardship to the public and that the record disclosed a lack of sufficient consideration of an appropriate weighing test as related to the granting of a variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the manager of a club. Alcohol was not allowed in the club, but she knew that the waitresses and dancers in the club allowed it. Defendant was convicted of alcohol-related offenses. She claimed: (1) that the trial court erred in not granting her motion to dismiss because she was not brought to trial within the time required by law; (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.58(B) was unconstitutional; and (3) the trial court erred in denying her acquittal motion. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that she was brought to trial within the time required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4399.09. Any delays were attributable to defendant. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.58(B) was previously upheld as constitutional and not overbroad. The selling or giving away alcoholic beverages did not involve First-Amendment rights to freedom of expression. The court held that recklessness was a sufficient culpability state for a violation of &sect; 4301.58(B). There was readily sufficient evidence that defendant acted recklessly. Defendant was the &quot;keeper of the place&quot; in that she was authorized to hire and fire waitresses and dancers and was in charge of their conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County (Ohio), which overruled his motion to vacate his judgment of conviction for violation of the Organized Crime Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of violating the Act. Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the Act was void for vagueness. Defendant filed a motion requesting an order vacating his conviction and vacating any period of probation or fines associated therewith. Defendant also sought an early termination of a period of probation on a count of operating a bingo game without a license. The trial court held that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision holding that the Act was void for vagueness should not be applied retroactively. The court reasoned that the conviction and sentence were executed under the color of law. The court proceedings were not void, and the Ohio Supreme Court did not pronounce or infer that other prior proceedings under the Act were void. The court found that the proceedings were voidable, in other words that they were valid until such time as they were vacated by judgment entry either upon challenge by a party with standing or sua sponte under the inherent power of the trial court. The court was bound to find that defendant, found guilty under a statute declared to be void, was guilty of no crime at all, and the conviction had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

When the jury found her guilty of voluntary manslaughter, defendant filed an appeal. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for acquittal as to all charges because there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury reasonably to conclude that defendant knowingly killed the victim while acting under great emotional stress brought on by provocation of the victim. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the circumstances surrounding the defendant's life. A charge with respect to extreme emotional stress was properly given because it was not an element of voluntary manslaughter, but was merely a circumstance which mitigated defendant's criminal culpability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners conducted a meeting in which four members voted in favor of a zoning change and one member voted against the change. The zoning change allowed a change in zoning from residential to commercial. The township trustees confirmed the commissioners' actions by passing a resolution authorizing the zoning change. Appellant contended that the resolution was void and unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants and the individual appealed, claiming that the commissioners' meeting in which the vote was conducted was not in compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found that the commissioners acted in substantial compliance with &sect; 519.12. A public hearing was held and the commissioners fulfilled the 30 day time requirement in voting for approval of the zone change. Further, the fact that an entry was not included in the township trustees' journal confirming the commissioners' actions did not invalidate the commissioners' actions. The entry was ministerial, rather than legislative in nature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied defendant's four motions to dismiss charges of aggravated vehicular homicide arising from an automobile-locomotive collision at a grade crossing in which three persons lost their lives. Defendant was a railroad corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's last motion to dismiss was based on speedy trial grounds because it had not been brought to trial within 270 days as prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C)(2). The trial court denied the motion, holding that &sect; 2945.71 was inapplicable to corporations. The trial court further found that significant delay was created by defendant and that there was just cause for delay pending the decision of the court of appeals on the trial court's ruling on a motion in limine filed in a related case. The trial court also denied the three other motions to dismiss. On appeal, the State argued that the denials of those three motions to dismiss were not final and appealable orders, and the court agreed. However, the denial of defendant's speedy trial motion was a final and appealable order. The court therefore considered it on its merits but found that the delay was necessitated by defendant's actions. Considering the number of motions and complexity of issues presented to the trial court by defendant, the court found that the delay was necessitated by defendant's own actions. Therefore, the limit of &sect; 2945.71(C)(2) was extended by virtue of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(E).</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.51. The court determined that because defendant demanded the testimony of the analyst that performed the tests, he did not waive his right to cross-examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the judgment of the Toledo Municipal Court (Ohio), which found in favor of defendant by denying plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal for want of prosecution of her personal injury action. Plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in dismissing her complaint without first notifying her counsel, that Toledo, Ohio, Mun. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an action against defendant for damages for personal injuries. Defendant filed an answer, and the parties began settlement negotiations. More than six months after the complaint was filed and without first providing written notice to plaintiff's attorney, the trial court dismissed the action without prejudice for want of prosecution. Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal was denied, and plaintiff appealed. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in refusing to grant plaintiff relief from judgment. There was a clear conflict between the provisions of Toledo, Ohio, Mun. Ct. R. 6(E) and Ohio Mun. &amp; County Superintendence R. 6(A). Toledo, Ohio, Mun. Ct. R. 6(D) did no facilitate the earlier disposition of cases, so the provisions of Ohio Mun. &amp; County Superintendence R. 6(A) took precedence, and the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint without first providing written notice of the dismissal to plaintiff's attorney. The sending of a letter to an attorney informing him that his case was going to be dismissed placed no added burden on Toledo Municipal Court employees beyond that already required by Toledo, Ohio, Mun. Ct. Rule 6(E)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs, specifically phencyclidine. Defendant contended that an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority resulted in the raising of his offense from a fourth-degree felony to a third-degree felony. The court observed that the General Assembly could delegate discretionary functions to administrative bodies so that they could apply the law to various sets of facts. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44(B)-(G) established standards to which the State Board of Pharmacy had to conform in making a determination to transfer a substance from one schedule to another, and a procedure was established whereby exercise of the discretion vested in the Board could be reviewed effectively. Therefore, the granting of authority to the Board pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44 to transfer a substance from one schedule to another did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and defendant was correctly charged with a third-degree felony because the Board transferred phencyclidine from Schedule III to Schedule II.</SPAN></P>

When the trial court found that the group home was not a permitted use under New Philadelphia, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 1161.02(i), the construction contractor and the building owners filed an appeal. The court reversed, noting that &sect; 1161.02(I) did not define public institutions, but that &quot;group home&quot; and &quot;institution&quot; were defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.19. The court held that any ambiguity in the ordinance had to be resolved against the city and that the meaning of the ordinance had to be examined in the context of the entire zoning code. The court concluded that the reasonable construction of the ordinance required a finding that that a &quot;group home&quot; as defined in &sect; 5123.19 was a permitted use within the meaning of New Philadelphia, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 1161.02(i).</SPAN></P>

The owners then tendered the $ 950. The trial court found the resolution was constitutional and dismissed the complaint. The owners appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 307.74 stated that the commissioners could permit a waterline to be tapped upon application of a property owner and they could charge a reasonable tapping fee, which would include a portion of the original cost and maintenance of the waterline. The issue was whether the $ 250 additional tap fee for each mobile home was reasonable and whether the commissioners were restricted to a front foot basis for charging tap-ins. The court held that there was a presumption of regulatory of the acts of public officials unless the contrary was shown. The court opined that there was no showing of irregularity of that the fees was excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for receiving stolen property. The court reversed that part of the judgment convicting defendant of receiving stolen property. The court held that the trial court erred in overruling his motions for acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to prove to reasonable minds beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew or had reason to know that the automobile was stolen. The trial court's jury instructions on receiving stolen property were erroneous because they improperly permitted the jury to infer that defendant knew that the automobile was stolen by his possession of it. Sections 2913.51, 4549.08 were not unconstitutionally vague. The propriety of the trial court's supplemental instruction to encourage the jury to reach a verdict was not reviewable because defendant failed to state with specificity the matter to which he objected as required under Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that (1) the trial court erred in finding him guilty of conspiracy pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.01(A)(2) because he was, in the same proceedings, also found guilty of the underlying substantive offense; (2) the trial court erred in finding him guilty of a second degree felony as to the charge of conspiracy to corrupt another with drugs; and (3) he could not have been convicted and sentenced upon the charge of corrupting another with drugs because the bill of information failed to allege an offense due to the omission of an essential element of the crime. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Defendant was charged with corrupting another with drugs in January, 1979, and was convicted therefor. On the other hand, the conspiracy charge to which defendant pled guilty covered a period of time from January, 1977, to July, 1980. Thus, well after he had committed the specific offense of corrupting another with drugs, defendant continued to conspire to do so again. Thus, defendant was properly convicted of both charges. Defendant was charged with and convicted of the proper degree of felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter of her boyfriend and sentenced her from four to 25 years in prison. Defendant argued that the trial court improperly allowed third party testimony concerning the victim's statement that defendant shot him because those hearsay statements were not properly shown to be dying declarations. Defendant also argued that the burden of proof was improperly placed upon her concerning her affirmative defense of self defense; therefore, her procedural due process rights were violated. On review, the court held that because defendant admitted that she shot her boyfriend, the victim, it did not have to determine if the third party statements were dying declarations. The court reasoned that the State could properly place the burden of proving affirmative defenses such as self-defense, extreme emotional disturbance, or insanity upon defendant. The court concluded that when the accused raised an affirmative defense, which did not serve to negate any element of the crime charged, but instead raised a separate issue or defense, the burden was upon the accused to prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The money found in such area and the money taken from defendant's pocket totaled the amount missing from a safe in the office. On appeal from defendant's conviction for grand theft, under &sect; 2913.02, the court held that: (1) the prosecutor's opening remark to the jury, that he did not know whether defendant would present evidence, was not prejudicial error because the jury was thoroughly instructed that it was the State's obligation to establish defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that defendant was not required to testify or to present witnesses; and (2) there was sufficient asportation to establish the offense of theft, which concerned the knowing obtainment or the exertion of control over the owner's property, because money was removed from its place of safety and put in defendant's pocket.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners and the company filed an action against the city, its Commissioner, its mayor, and members of its city council, for compensatory and punitive damages. The owners first claimed that they owned certain real estate in the city and constructed and operated thereon a hardware store. The premises were leased to the company, which operated in the hardware business. The owners and the company alleged that they asked permission to construct a flood wall, and after initial approval, this permit was wrongfully revoked although the plans were in conformity to all laws and regulations. They further asserted that this caused damage to the owners' property when water came on their property. The second claim alleged a loss of salary as corporate officers. The third claim alleged an unconstitutional invasion of property rights. The trial court dismissed the owners and the company's complaint on the basis of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court reversed in part the judgment, by holding that the claim of an unconstitutional invasion of property rights was improperly dismissed because the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not a valid defense to an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate taxpayer manufactured iron casting patterns that it sold to purchasers, who used the patterns to make finished products. The patterns were made to the purchasers' specifications and were retained by the taxpayer, who used them to make finished products when they were ordered. The Commissioner assesses the state sales and use taxes and a county regional transit authority tax on the patterns, and it assessed penalties against the taxpayer. The Board affirmed the Commissioner's assessments. On appeal, the court reversed the assessment of the sales tax. The court held that the retention of the patterns by the taxpayer did not amount to a sale because there was no consideration. The court also concluded that the &quot;edge&quot; that the taxpayer may have had by having the patterns in its possession, thus making it more likely to secure orders, was not consideration. The court also reversed the assessment of the regional transit tax assessed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5741.022, holding that it was unconstitutional because it discriminated between property purchased in the State and outside the State.

The court determined that expert opinion testimony was not admissible on matters of common knowledge and further determined that it was within the common knowledge to decide what materials appealed to the prurient interest of the average person. The court found that the definition of obscenity in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F) with the Miller guidelines incorporated was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and further found that the provisions of the crime were clear and unequivocal to delineate what was the proscribed conduct for the general public.

The court determined that the jury was not fully instructed until it received both the statutory definition of obscenity and the Miller guidelines.

Defendant sought review and contended that the juvenile court abused its discretion in transferring him for prosecution as an adult. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26 and Ohio R. Juv. P. 30, the juvenile court had broad discretion in determining whether to transfer a juvenile to adult court for prosecution. The court held that the juvenile court was not required to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of factors set for in Rule 30 but rather needed only to find &quot;reasonable grounds to believe&quot; that the child was not amenable to the rehabilitative facilities of the Youth Commission. The court found that the juvenile court's determination that defendant was not amenable to rehabilitative facilities was not unreasonable and further determined that the juvenile court had not acted unreasonably or with an arbitrary, unconscionable attitude.

Defendant asserted that the provision for incorporation in &sect; 3719.43 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The trial court agreed and entered a dismissal in both cases. The State appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the indictments as &sect; 3719.43 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The court found that it was not necessary to pass upon the question as to whether the court had jurisdiction to entertain the State's appeal because defendant did not argue or brief the 1978 amendment to &sect; 2945.67.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The trial court had a mandatory duty to examine and consider the transcript of the hearing and it could not fulfill that duty by examining and considering only the hearing examiner's report. The clear language of the statute directed the reviewing court to look at the entire record, not just summaries, and to determine whether the order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4741.22(R) was not unconstitutionally vague, uncertain, or indefinite because it allowed the suspension of a veterinarian on the grounds that he was guilty of gross incompetence. The phrase had a degree of certainty that was prima facie sufficient to advise the practitioner about what conduct was forbidden. The veterinarian's due process rights were not violated by the failure of the board members to consider the evidence of the hearing before rendering their decision.

Police officers were not authorized under Ohio Rev.

Defendant asserted that the court improperly overruled a motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized in a nonconsensual search of a vehicle and that he and a co-defendant were improperly arrested contrary to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of grand theft and the court affirmed his conviction. Defendant asserted that evidence taken from his vehicle was seized during an unlawful search. The court held that based on the totality of the circumstances, there had been knowing, intelligent, and voluntary consent to this search. For that reason, the trial court properly refused to suppress evidence seized thereto. Further, the court found that defendant was properly arrested. Police officers were not authorized under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03, to make warrantless arrests of persons outside of the geographic boundaries of their municipality for traffic offenses committed outside of municipal limits. That rule, however, did not compel the exclusion of the testimony of an officer that made an unauthorized arrest assuming that the arrest was based on probable cause that a crime was committed within the officer's jurisdiction and the officer had been in hot pursuit of the misdemeanants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought a zoning change of her land. Appellee township board of trustees denied the requested zoning change. The landowner filed a complaint in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and writ of mandamus ordering the approval of the zoning change. The trial court denied her relief and dismissed the complaint. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that the trial court erred when it determined that the township trustees had not abused their discretion or acted in excess of their powers or in an unreasonable exercise of their discretion in denying the request to change zoning of her property. She also argued that the trial court's decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that the denial of the requested zoning change was unreasonable and arbitrary. When viewed with regard for the pattern of development in the surrounding area, the decision denying the requested zoning change was not in accordance with the comprehensive scheme of development in that area. Furthermore, while not determinative, the &quot;highest and best&quot; use for a parcel of property could be properly considered as a factor in determining the reasonableness of a zoning decision. The court further found that insufficient evidence was presented to sustain a finding that the denial was based upon public health, safety, and welfare considerations. The court found that substantial justice had not been done the landowner, and the judgment of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision. The court ordered that the township trustees should approve the rezoning of the property in question and should authorize the issuance of a zoning certificate and building permit thereon. The court remanded for assessment of costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated murder with specifications. He was alleged to have murdered his mother, brother, sister-in-law, and their children. To the indictments, pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity were entered. Preliminarily, he was found competent to stand trial. A written jury waiver was signed by defendant, and the waiver included a consent to be tried by three judges of the trial court. Defendant thereafter filed a motion for a new trial stating that the jury waiver was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given because it was given upon the invalid premise that the verdict was required to be unanimous. The motion was overruled and defendant was sentenced to 11 consecutive life terms. That decision was reversed and a new trial was awarded. Defendant then appealed, on double jeopardy grounds, from the decision denying his motion for acquittal. The court affirmed, holding that where defendant's trial had been reversed because of an invalid jury waiver, a retrial did not conflict with the constitutional rule against double jeopardy. Only a reversal based on the weight of the evidence precluded a retrial on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a finding by the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio) that an ordinance under which appellee gun sellers were charged was unconstitutional. The trial court found that Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 674.10, which required that stolen or lost handguns be reported to the chief of police &quot;immediately upon discovery of such theft or loss,&quot; was impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal was whether Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 674.10 was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The disputed language was in the phrases in the ordinance requiring a report to the Chief of Police, &quot;immediately upon discovery of theft or loss&quot; of handguns. The sellers waited 10 days before making their report. The passage in contention involved the definition of the word &quot;immediately&quot; considered in light of the criteria established by the courts to determine vagueness. The word implied prompt, vigorous action without delay. The court held that the sellers were experienced in the sale of firearms. According to their appellate brief, they were in the business of retail firearms sales since 1934. The sellers could not claim ignorance of the ordinance or its purpose. Ten days, under any interpretation, was hardly &quot;immediately.&quot; Fair notice was given a person of ordinary intelligence that his conduct was proscribed when he waited 10 days to give a notice that the law required to be given &quot;immediately.&quot; The court reversed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer purchased a camera motor drive for her husband as a gift, and she paid cash for the item.

The consumer filed an action against the supplier under the Act alleging unconscionable sales practices, and the trial court awarded her the sum of the sales transaction plus an attorney's fee and costs. On appeal by the supplier, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the supplier did not offer any reasonable justification as to why it refused to make a cash refund and that the supplier did not have any sign conspicuously posted stating its refund policy. Thus, as a matter of law, the supplier violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1345.02 and 1345.03(B) based upon the lack of a posted refund policy, lack of any oral representations to the consumer as to its refund policy, and the admitted assurances of &quot;making it good&quot; to the consumer by the supplier's agent.

The court affirmed, finding that the record contained reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that the corporation had not demonstrated a good faith effort to promote cost savings through the use of financial incentives and disincentives as required by Ohio Admin.

There was also no evidence to indicate that the corporation had made a good faith effort involving incentive reimbursement experiments, as required by &sect; 3901-1-28(F)(7).

Defendant also asserted that &sect; 2913.02 was unconstitutionally applied, because it pur him twice in jeopardy for the same conduct. He asserted that his conviction for grand theft, based, in part, upon the prior theft offense, was an impermissible additional punishment for the same prior theft conviction. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that (1) the record clearly indicated that the trial court fully complied with Ohio R. Crim.

Defendant readily complied but her husband lingered and attempted to conceal her purse prior to leaving the room. The drugs were discovered inside the purse. On appeal, defendant argued that her conviction was unlawful because Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4729-11 allowed for an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency, the state pharmacy board. She also claimed that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the drug found in her purse because the search warrant did not include a search of her person and the purse was merely an extension of her person. In rejecting the foregoing arguments, the court held that at the time that defendant's purse was searched, she had abandoned it so that it was no longer associated with her person and was instead being concealed by her husband. Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.41 clearly demonstrated that specific guidelines and principles governing the pharmacy board's actions were provided. Thus, Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4729-11 did not authorize an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

Defendant borrowed money from his ex-wife supposedly to buy groceries and cigarettes but instead he purchased a gun. He burst into his wife's trailer brandishing the gun and forced her to leave with him. He threatened to blow her brains out, and two hours later his wife was found dead with four gunshot wounds all fired at close range. Defendant admitted he had shot her. Defendant was found guilty of aggravated murder and, he appealed. The court affirmed. The State properly placed the burden of proving his insanity defense upon defendant. Also, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.37 and 2945.38 did not expose defendant to possible self-incrimination. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the victim's 11-year-old son to testify. Moreover, the declaration of the victim's daughter to her neighbor constituted a spontaneous declaration, and therefore it was an exception to the hearsay rule. Finally, there was reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of prior calculation and design to support a guilty verdict to the charge of aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

The employees contended they were entitled to unemployment compensation for the week involved, but the employer refused to render it. The employees filed claims before the referee of the Board for compensation, who recommended denial of each claim, a finding which was adopted by the Board. The trial court reversed on the ground that the Board's finding was unlawful and against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court ruled that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.29(D)(2)(b), if an employee declined suitable work offered to him by an employer which he was not required to accept under the union contract, he was not entitled to payment of benefits for any week during which they exercised such an option.

A search of their neighborhood recovered clothing containing their blood, apparently discarded by their killer. Defendant was determined to be the third source of blood on the clothing. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. A vehicle matching the exact description of defendant's automobile was seen at their home prior to the murder. Defendant's main defense was insanity. A defense witness testified that defendant was schizoid, but did not agree that defendant was criminally insane at the time of the offenses. However, a state's witness rebutted the evidence presented by the defense as to defendant's insanity. The trial court did not erroneously exclude the testimony of the jail's intake screener. In fact, the screener read her entire report to the jury. The trial court properly kept her from giving a psychiatric or medical opinion. Defendant was properly required to prove his affirmative defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant could constitutionally be required to prove to a stated extent all circumstances of justification, excuse, or alleviation, of the charged offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of a lesser included offense of murder. The court affirmed. The court held that if reasonable minds could differ that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, the motion for judgment of acquittal must be denied and the case permitted to go to the jury. The court reasoned that although defense testimony established the affirmative defense elements of self defense, the victim's sister's testimony destroyed the self defense claim and created an issue of fact in dispute. The court found the burden of proof requirement concerning affirmative defenses to be constitutional. Where an affirmative defense did not serve to negate any facts of the crime that the State was to prove in order to convict for murder, it was not an unconstitutional burden of proof to require defendant to establish his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The court concluded that the State's comments were proper upon the absence of defendant's mother and brother after the State attempted to subpoena them, where they had disappeared and defendant commented that he could not endanger his family members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' pleas of guilty to dog fighting in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 959.16 did not insulate the State from a timely attack charging that the State did not have the authority to prosecute. The claim that the statute was facially unconstitutional was preserved. The court agreed that citizens who desired to obey the law would have no difficulty understanding it. The State, as a condition of conviction, had to prove that the accused acted &quot;knowingly&quot; or &quot;purposely&quot; in promoting or engaging in dog fighting, as those terms were described in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.22. The court assumed that the lack of a challenge for decades meant the term &quot;dog fighting&quot; had a sufficiently broad understanding so as to advise the people of Ohio what the conduct was, and was not, legal or illegal. It was clear that by extracting dog fighting from general sections dealing with animals fighting, the legislature intended to give separate treatment to what it perceived to be an activity of grave criminal import. The court could not say that the legislation or the sentence amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and found that the dog fighting statute was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

In patting him down to locate identification, the police officers found six packet of phencyclidine, PCP, on him. In seeking review of his conviction, defendant claimed that the delegation by the State legislature to the State Board of Pharmacy to determine classifications of controlled substances was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the State Board of Pharmacy merely determined the facts and acted accordingly to the mandates of the law. Therefore, the authority conferred by Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a condominium owners association, appealed from a trial court (Ohio), which dismissed the association's complaint against appellee city. The association had challenged the constitutionality of Willowick, Ohio, Ordinance 63-50, &sect; 7, which prohibited the occupancy of a multiple dwelling unit unless the owner had obtained an occupancy license. Such license could only be obtained after an inspection by the city for which it charged a fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued that Willowick, Ohio, Ordinance 63-50, &sect; 7 was unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. XVII, &sect; 3 because it conflicted with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5311.03, that it violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did not apply to single-family homeowners, and that the license fee was actually a tax and, therefore, was unconstitutional. The court found that the ordinance did not violate Ohio Const. art. XVII, &sect; 3 because it permitted ownership and exclusive possession, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5311.03, once a license was issued. The court rejected the association's equal protection claim on the grounds that the class for purposes of comparison was other residents of multiple dwelling units, not single-family homeowners, and that the ordinance did not discriminate between members of that class. The court stated that to establish that the license fee was a tax, the association had been required to show that the amount of the fee exceeded the amount necessary to cover administrative expenses and regulation. Because the association had presented no evidence or testimony regarding these issues, the court held it had failed to sustain its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the company's appeal on the ground that the board's decision was not quasi-judicial in nature and was therefore not appealable under Ohio Rev.

The court determined that the board's decision was not judicial or quasi-judicial in nature, but rather a refusal to act in a contractual matter with a commercial enterprise. The court concluded that the trial court properly dismissed the company's appeal because the board's decision was not an appealable final order subject to judicial review under &sect; 2506.01.</SPAN></P>

The application for change of zoning was denied. Subsequently, the country club sought declaratory relief from the trial court. The trial court found that the zoning ordinance was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of power by the city, and it arbitrarily and unreasonably restricted the use of, and was unconstitutional as applied to, said parcels without any relation to the public peace, health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The judgment went on to grant to the country club, its successors and assigns, the right to use the six parcels in accordance with the request contained in its complaint, and forever enjoined the city from interfering with said use of the premises as declared to be the rights of the parties. The court reversed the judgment and held that the trial court erred in holding the existing zoning ordinance, as applied to the country club's parcels, to be arbitrary, unreasonable, and unconstitutional because no effort was made to show in what respect the zoning of the parcels, in relation to the zoning of the entire community, was arbitrary, confiscatory, or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee had made an application for appointment as guardian of appellant on the basis of incompetence by reason of advanced age. Thereafter, appellant sought to terminate the guardianship on the grounds that she was restored to competency and that she did not consent. The probate court upheld her motion to terminate the guardianship on the ground that she was restored to competency, but overruled the motion to terminate for lack of consent. Appellant contended that incompetence by advanced age implied incompetency due to physical disability and thus her consent was required under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2111.02. Upon reviewing the statutory scheme, the court concluded that advanced age was not synonymous with mental incompetency and that for a guardianship to be established on such grounds, consent of the proposed ward was required. To lawfully establish a guardianship against one's will, proof of mental incompetency was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed from a grant of expungement to defendant by the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio). Defendant had been convicted of attempted aggravated assault, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.02, 2903.12, and sought expungement of her record pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the lower court's expungement order claiming first that the trial court had not held a hearing as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.32. However, the trial court's opinion recited that the matter had come before it for judicial consideration. Because there was no transcript or statement of proceedings, and because trial court proceedings were entitled to a presumption of regularity, the court held that the State failed to demonstrate that any error occurred. The State next argued that expungement was not permitted because defendant had not committed an offense for which she was eligible for probation. However, the record did not show that defendant had committed attempted aggravated assault with a firearm, so she may have been eligible for probation. Because the State failed to show how the underlying offense had been committed, the trial court's judgment was presumed to be correct. Finally, the State argued that defendant was not eligible for expungement because the court costs for her trial had not been paid. However, the trial court had found defendant to be indigent and denying expungement based on indigency would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the family had an income of between $ 1,260 to $ 1,300 per month, they had had three separate residences within the period of 18 months. During the summer of 1973, the family did not live in a house at all, but lived in a car, taking their meals from fast food restaurants and using the sanitary facilities at gas stations and public parks. The family would eat food that had been thrown into trash containers at the back of a supermarket because it was outdated. The father would consume the food first and, if he suffered no ill consequences, he would serve it to his children. There was also testimony from two social workers regarding fights, charges of sexual infidelity, lack of furniture and beds when they were staying at a residence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03(b), which defined a neglected child, was not unconstitutionally vague and sufficiently apprised the ordinary average parent of the requirements named by the statute. And, the finding of the trial court that the children were &quot;neglected&quot; as that term is used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03(B) was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The projectionists filed suit seeking a declaration by the trial court that the exemption from prosecution of projectionists for pandering obscenity contained in Ohio Rev.

The court held that the state legislature, by providing an exemption for motion picture projectionists from prosecution for pandering obscenity, created an unconstitutional classification thereby denying similarly situated persons equal protection of the laws. The court found that the fact that the way in which projectionists were assigned might have to change was no justification for the classification in &sect; 2907.35(C). Although the projectionists succeeded in establishing a difference between them and other non-interested employees, they failed to show a legitimate state purpose that was served by differentiating between projectionists and other employees.

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had formerly pled no contest to a motor vehicle trespass charge, which was a violation of Cleveland, Ohio, Municipal Ordinance &sect; 625.07. Two of the defendants also pled no contest to a petty theft offense, which was a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02. Defendants were later brought to trial on charges of possession of criminal tools in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24(A). In dismissing the charges, the trial court applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel to prohibit the State from prosecuting defendants on the charge which arose from the same transaction or occurrence as the charges for which they had previously been convicted. On appeal, the State argued that collateral estoppel was inapplicable. The court agreed with the State's argument and determined that unconstitutional former jeopardy did not attach based upon the application of the two-pronged Blockburger test. Under the Blockburger test, which was used to determine whether two offenses were the same for constitutional double jeopardy analysis, the offenses for which defendants were prosecuted required different proof such that the State's charges on the separate offenses were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which, after a jury trial, found him guilty of petty theft for stealing property valued at less than $ 150, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02, and possessing criminal tools, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24. Defendant, who presented no evidence in his own defense at trial, attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 2923.24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by police carrying a piece of concrete while peering into cars in a parking lot. He subsequently broke a window of a car with the concrete, snatched a cassette radio, and attempted to flee before being apprehended by the police. He contended that &sect; 2923.24 violated his right to due process because it set forth standards that were too vague to be enforceable. The court disagreed and held that the statute was constitutional. The court found that the proscribed conduct of possession of an item with purpose to use it criminally was sufficiently explicit under applicable standards and gave definite warning as to the forbidden conduct. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that the block of concrete could not be said to be a &quot;tool&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 2923.24, noting that the statute defined the term &quot;tool&quot; broadly and that the evidence demonstrated defendant used the block of concrete in a criminal fashion to break into a car and to steal an item from within. Finally, the court found that the fact that defendant was not in possession of the concrete block at the time of his arrest did not mean that he did not possess it at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A referee with the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services rendered a decision denying appellant claimant unemployment compensation and the claimant filed an appeal. The court of common pleas (Ohio), dismissed the claimant's appeal for the reason that the notice of appeal was not filed with the Board of Review within 30 days of the mailing of the decision, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.28(O). The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed an appeal with the Board on February 19, 1980. The Board disallowed the appeal and mailed its decision to the claimant on March 18, 1980. The claimant filed a notice of appeal with the trial court on April 15, and on April 17, mailed a copy to the Board. The Board received the notice on April 21, 1980, 34 days after it had mailed its decision to the claimant. The claimant argued that under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4141.28(O), a notice of appeal was &quot;filed&quot; with the Board when the claimant mailed it. The claimant also argued that the time for appeal to court had not began to run because the Administrator was never served with a copy of the decision of the Board. The court held that within the meaning of &sect; 4141.28(O), a notice of appeal was &quot;filed&quot; when it was received by the Board, and that because the claimant's notice of appeal to court was not received by the Board within 30 days of the date that the Board's decision was mailed to the claimant, the trial court properly dismissed the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The court held however that the record did not demonstrate whether the Administrator was served or not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that &sect; 2913.02 was unconstitutional because it made proof of her prior conviction an element of the current offense. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that &sect; 2913.02 did not violate defendant's rights to due process because the due process clause did not prevent the states from enacting legislative schemes to deal with habitual offenders. Essentially, &sect; 2913.02 required the prosecution to prove that defendant had been convicted of the same offense on a prior occasion. This allowed the prosecution to elevate the charge from a misdemeanor to a forth degree felony. The court also found that defendant's sentence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02(B) was not unconstitutional under U.S. Cons. amend. VIII. The court reasoned that her punishment was permissible as it allowed the state to deal with recidivists and was based upon her current and past offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant neighbors challenged a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit (Ohio), which was entered in favor of appellees, the city and a landowner, after the neighbors challenged an ordinance which granted a conditional use allowing four-unit buildings on the landowner's property. The neighbors sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court effectively granted summary judgment for appellees, the neighbors voluntarily dismissed their substantive claims and perfected an appeal on the procedural issues. They contended that the trial court erred in finding that Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1234.28 controlled the action. They asserted that a statutorily required 30-day notice of the time and place of the hearing on the proposed rezoning should have been given. Appellees maintained that the 10-day notice required by the ordinance properly applied. The court adopted the latter view and ruled that the trial court was correct in holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.12 did not apply. The court also construed Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1234.28 and determined that the notice met its time requirements. The court rejected the contention that the trial court erred in finding that the neighbors lacked standing to assert a violation of other property owners' rights. In addition, the trial judge was justified in finding that an individual's actual knowledge of the hearing was imputed to a company in which he was an officer. The company was estopped from raising objections to the form of notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a child's mother, his grandmother, and his guardian ad litem, challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, Preble County, (Ohio), which held that appellee State of Ohio had shown by clear and convincing evidence that the child was a neglected child. The trial court awarded permanent custody of the child to a social services agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The social services agency was awarded temporary custody of the child. The agency placed him in a foster home and permitted his mother to have 13 visitations prior to the hearing on permanent custody. On appeal, the court opined that apparently the juvenile court's opinion as to neglect was primarily based upon conditions which existed prior to and at the time of the filing of the complaint for permanent custody. Reversing, the court noted that, under Ohio law, conditions supporting a finding of neglect were required to exist at the time of the adjudicatory hearing. In addition, the record showed that there was never a dispositional hearing as required by Ohio R. Juv. P. 29, 34. A review of the juvenile court's opinion indicated that the adjudication of neglect improperly merged with beliefs as to the best interests of the child. The court also held that the complaint for permanent custody was insufficient to support the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. The juvenile court's award of permanent custody was void ab initio, leaving in force the prior temporary commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was charged with violating &sect; 672.14(A) in that he carried on or about his person a bowie knife, to-wit: a hunting knife with a five-inch blade. No charge of carrying a concealed weapon under state law was made. It was not disputed that defendant did carry on his person a knife of the kind described. The trial court adjudicated defendant to be a juvenile delinquent. Defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 672.14 was unconstitutional in that it absolutely and unqualifiedly abrogated the right of the people to keep and bear arms. The court held that the ordinance was invalid under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 because it was in conflict with the general Ohio state statutes. It prohibited all police, sheriffs and their deputies, state highway patrolmen, and federal agents from carrying pistols in the city. It also would have been impossible, under &sect; 672.14, for a person to purchase any of the items prohibited thereby in the city for a lawful purpose because their mere possession was unqualifiedly prohibited. Thus, not only was statutorily authorized police activity prohibited by &sect; 672.14, but private, legislatively authorized conduct was also unqualified outlawed.</SPAN></P>

The hospital filed a motion to quash the subpoena and for a protective order preventing the patient from gaining access to the requested records. The trial court granted the motion, quashed the subpoena and granted the protective order. The trial court later entered a judgment in favor of the doctor, and the patient sought review, primarily on the grounds that the trial court erred in quashing the motion, and the statutes under which the court ruled were unconstitutional. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2305.25 and 2305.251 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, or Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two men entered a pharmacy, bound the employees, and took money and drugs. An employee recognized one of the robbers as being a man who had come into the pharmacy two days earlier with a prescription that did not belong to him. The pharmacy refused to fill the prescription and retained it; the employee recorded the license plate number of the person's car, which belonged to defendant. Three of five witnesses identified defendant from photographs and four of five witnesses identified defendant in a line-up consisting of him and a person suspected as the second robber. On appeal, the court ruled that because defendant did not address the issue of the prescription during the hearing on his motion to suppress, because he did not object at trial when it was offered into evidence, and because the attempt to pass the bad prescription was not an act wholly independent of the aggravated robbery, the trial court did not err by admitting the prescription into evidence. The photographic array was not unnecessarily suggestive and the identification testimony contained sufficient indicia of reliability under the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test so that it was properly not suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charitable organizations operated bingo games under licenses issued by the Attorney General.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2915.07 to 2915.11. The charitable organizations initiated an action, challenging the constitutionality of the revocation statute. They claimed the statute violated the equal protection of law and due process of law by ignoring the distinction between willful and unintentional violations. In affirming the decision, the court found that the statute was mandatory in nature, requiring the revocation of a bingo license upon proof of a violation of the statute. The court held that the legislator made the acts themselves sufficient to warrant sanctions, irrespective of the actor's motivation or intent. The charitable organizations were afforded a full due process administrative hearing before their licenses were revoked. The court found no constitutional infirmity in a statute requiring revocation of licenses upon proof of acts or omissions contrary to law, irrespective of criminal knowledge or guilty intent.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and ordered defendant's discharge. The court noted the strong presumption in favor of the constitutionality of legislation and found that the ordinance did not conflict with constitutional rights and was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. It was not only the right, but also the duty of the City of Bryan to promulgate reasonable laws, rules, and regulations to promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of a community and its citizens. As such, Bryan, Ohio, Ordinance 331.34 was a proper exercise of police power. The record was void of any evidence indicating that defendant failed to exercise reasonable and ordinary control over his vehicle. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the language of the first paragraph of the ordinance directly related to the second paragraph.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, two prostitutes and an apartment renter, were convicted by a common pleas court (Ohio) of promoting prostitution in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.22. The first prostitute and the renter filed a joint appeal, contending that the trial court erred in denying their acquittal and suppression motions. The second prostitute appealed, raising those same issues and arguing that her motion for a separate trial was erroneously denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After responding to an advertisement, a police officer received a nude picture of the prostitutes and a printed statement that they were available for nude sessions and erotic massage. The officer made an appointment for a massage, was met by the prostitutes, paid cash, signed a disclaimer that he was not a police officer, and removed his clothes as told. The first prostitute disrobed and placed his penis in her mouth. The second prostitute disrobed and placed her breast in his mouth. The second prostitute was arrested in her bedroom, where the cash, pictures of nude people, and customer information were seized. The renter was arrested later, in the apartment's hallway. The court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied. The officer's entry into the apartment was valid. He asked for a legal massage and was voluntarily allowed to enter. The seized items were in plain view. The denial of the motion to acquit was proper. The officers did not have probable cause to secure an arrest warrant until after the crime was committed. Illegal activity was not solicited. The second prostitute was not entitled to a separate trial. There was no clear conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendants of promoting prostitution and ordered that a special mandate issue directing to the trial court to carry the court's judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and the court reversed the judgment and ordered him to be discharged. The court held that one part of a statute may be unconstitutional without affecting the validity of the remainder of the statute. However, defendant could not be prosecution for a violation of &sect; 337.23(a)(9) because the stricken parts were so essential to the remainder of the ordinance and the purpose of the enactment that the Cleveland City Council would have refused to adopt it with the invalid parts stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a tip about an erratic driver, a suburban officer sighted defendant driving into the municipality. The suburban officer pursued, concluded defendant's driving was dangerously erratic, stopped defendant's car, and radioed for a municipal officer's assistance. After defendant failed a field sobriety and breathalyzer tests administered by the municipal officer, he was arrested. Defendant moved to suppress the test results. The trial court granted the motion. The city appealed. The suburban officers' actions were not an arrest but constituted a valid detention under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03(D) because the pursuit began inside the suburb and points were charged for defendant's offense. The municipal officer had made a valid arrest because he had personal knowledge of defendant's intoxication prior to the arrest. The municipal officer was permitted to rely upon the observations of the suburban officers and the radio broadcast that defendant had been driving shortly before the municipal officer concluded defendant was intoxicated. Even if the arrest had been unlawful under state law, it was not unconstitutional; therefore, the exclusionary rule had been inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fired his derringer and shot the victim in the chest. Defendant returned home and called the police. Defendant was indicted for felonious assault, carrying a concealed weapon, and receiving stolen property. The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated assault. Defendant appealed. The jury was correctly instructed on the relationship between felonious assault, aggravated assault, and self-defense because where self-defense was claimed aggravated assault was a lessor-included charge of felonious assault. The constitutionality of the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) was not in issue because the trial court had not used the language of the statute and at no time had its instructions placed any burden of proof upon defendant. The jury was justified in finding defendant had not acted in self-defense and had committed aggravated assault. Defendant's sentence was within the perimeters of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11 and the trial court had shown consideration of all the sentencing factors required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was provided with proper notice by a letter sent to the address listed on his driver's license. Also, because &sect; 15-1-4507.38 did not provide a culpable mental state, the presumed mental state was recklessness under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.21(B).

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7) and sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 2 to 15 years and actual incarceration of six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, alleging that the mandatory sentence statute was inconsistent with and repealed the indeterminate sentence statute. On appeal, the court held that to accomplish the legislature's purpose of directing the minimum periods of incarceration for specific offenses, the two statutes had to be construed together, especially because the sentencing statutes related to the same subject matter. The court found that if the actual incarceration had been greater than the minimum under the indeterminate sentencing statute, then the actual incarceration period would have prevailed. Defendant also argued that the term &quot;bulk amount&quot; used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7) was ambiguous and that three times the bulk amount was vague. The court found that bulk amount was defined as an amount equal to or exceeding 10 grams and that defendant sold 54 grams, more than three times 10 grams. Lastly, defendant contended that while the evidence was sufficient to establish that the random sample was a controlled substance, the evidence was not sufficient as to the entire bulk. The court found that all of the pieces in the bulk were alike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both defendant's conviction for trafficking in drugs and his sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the verdict convicting him of receiving stolen property was contrary to law and the evidence. Defendant's convictions were reversed. The court held that there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant of receiving stolen property because the essential element, that he received, retained, or disposed of stolen property subsequent to the theft, was missing. The court stated that the only evidence relative to the stolen property, which was found in the other man's car, subsequent to the theft was that they were found in the other person's car. There was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, connecting defendant to the other person's car.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity of burglary. He was committed to a state hospital.

Defendant argued that the trial court failed to find by clear and convincing evidence that the state hospital was the least restrictive commitment alternative available. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord filed a forcible entry and detainer action against appellee tenant, asserting that the premises could not and would not continue to be operated as a rental unit due to unfeasible repairs. The Dayton Municipal Court (Ohio) determined that the action was in retaliation for the tenant's complaints about the condition of her apartment. The court denied the landlord's motion for a new trial, and the landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord argued that the trial court misapplied the burden of proof regarding claims of retaliatory eviction. In affirming, the court held that, once the tenant showed that the decision to evict was in response to her complaints, the landlord had burden of proving a valid reason for eviction. With regard to unfeasibility of repairs, the facts relevant to such an assertion were peculiarly within the knowledge of the landlord and, as such, had to be shown by her. The tenant had established a causal link between her complaints and the action by the landlord. Had it not been for the legitimate complaints, the eviction action would probably not have been commenced. Therefore, although the trial court erred in relying upon a presumption of retaliatory motive, the error was harmless. Because the landlord chose not to alter, remodel, or demolish the premises, she could not rely on the statute allowing those circumstances. The assertion of economic unfeasibility of repair was more susceptible to abuse and was carefully scrutinized. The trial court had determined that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the necessary repairs were, in fact, economically unfeasible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the trial court (Ohio), which convicted her of grand theft by deception pursuant to her no-contest plea after the prosecutor determined that defendant was not eligible to participate in a pretrial diversion program. Defendant stipulated that for a period of nine months, while she was employed, she had improperly sought and obtained overpayments in welfare benefits under the aid for dependent children program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had filed a motion below requesting that she be admitted to the diversion program or, in the alternative, that the charges against her be dismissed. Defendant argued that, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the prosecutor discriminated between persons who committed welfare fraud for six months or less and those who committed it for more than six months. The court found that the prosecutor's exercise of some selectivity was not in itself unconstitutional unless it was based on an unjustifiable standard. The court held that the classification created by the prosecutor had a rational relationship to the purposes and goals of the diversion program and a reasonable relationship to the legitimate interest of the State in the fair administration of the welfare program. The court found that defendant's actions had harmed truly needy persons and had thwarted the county welfare department in its efforts to assist such persons. The court also found that it was proper to exclude defendant from the program because she was a repeat offender, having committed grand theft each month during the nine-month period, and because she had engaged in a lucrative illegal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the state patrol's interference with the Intoxilyzer test denied him due process of law and that the trial court had erred by refusing him the right to fully attack the state patrol's credibility. The court affirmed the conviction, stating that the trial court had ordered the results of the Intoxilyzer test suppressed based on the State's agreement to do so. Had the tests been conducted, defendant would have shown that the test was not reliable, at best. Even if defendant could show that the state patrol did not want their Intoxilyzer machine tested, it was within the trial court's discretion to refuse to admit that evidence. The trial court had the discretion to prevent defense counsel from misleading the jury by using the word &quot;intoxicated&quot; rather than the standard of under the influence. The standard of being under the influence was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently allowed persons to adjust their behavior to conform with the law. There was ample evidence to support the conviction, and it was not surprising that the jury considered the arresting officer's testimony more credible than defendant's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The concrete company leased a parcel of land from the realty company and obtained permits to construct a concrete batch plant and other facilities on the property.

The companies brought a declaratory judgment action to contest the constitutionality of the ordinance as applied to the property. The action was dismissed. The companies filed a second action for declaratory relief. The trial court found in favor of the companies. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding (1) the trial court properly found that the companies were required to prove by clear and convincing evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied, (2) the rezoning ordinance was unreasonable and arbitrary as applied because, among other things, the land was unsuited for single family development, single family development was economically impractical, and the land was rendered virtually worthless as a result of the rezoning, and (3) the trial court erred in ordering that the prior zoning classification was applicable to the land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the ground that &sect; 4301.58(B) was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled defendant's motion and found her guilty in all four cases. The trial court fined defendant $ 150 and sentenced her to 100 days' imprisonment in each case. Defendant argued that &sect; 4301.58(B) was unconstitutional for overbreadth in that it could have been applied unconstitutionally to individuals in other situations. The court disagreed with defendant's overbreadth argument because it found that selling or giving way alcoholic beverages did not involve First Amendment rights to freedom of expression. Defendant also contended that the sentences imposed were too severe. The court was unable to ascertain what matters were taken into consideration by the trial judge at the time of sentencing because it did not have a transcript of the proceedings in the trial court. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.22(E) condoned the imposition of both a fine and imprisonment where the offense was committed for purpose of gain and the admitted facts established that defendant committed the offense for gain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which assessed an award of damages against the company as civil penalties at the instance of respondent Ohio Attorney General on behalf of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Ohio Clean Water Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company failed to comply with the terms of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. That permit required construction of wastewater treatment facilities and fixed final effluent limitations. The trial court assessed the civil damages against the company for its violation of the Ohio Clean Water Act. The company appealed the amount of the award as excessive. The court found that authority for civil penalties for noncompliance was provided within the framework of the Ohio Clean Water Act. The record supported the finding that the company was insensitive to the regulatory scheme. The substantial penalty levied by the trial court was not excessive, even though the largest increment responded to the company's recalcitrance and indifference over actual harm and economic gain from delay. Thus, the penalty was a deterrent rather than compensation for the wrong. The considerable delays in achieving compliance with the permit were clearly unjustified and there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court. A substantial penalty was not arbitrary and was reasonably related to the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dealt with the issue of whether a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence was present to support the decision to temporarily suspend the officer. The court found that the Board found only that the officer had used physical force on the prisoner, and that such a determination was insufficient to prove a violation of Fairborn, Ohio, Police Dept. Disciplinary R. 302. The court found that there was no evidence as to any reasonable alternative that could have been taken by the officer in response to the sudden assault by the prisoner. The court found that the officer had already attempted at length to calm the prisoner down, and that he was able to subdue the prisoner within 10 seconds after having been struck in the head. The court stated that the fact that he used a choke hold to accomplish such a task was questioned as being inappropriate within the confines of a police station, but that there was insufficient evidence to support such a position. The court found that the officer appeared to remain in control of the situation at all times, using only that amount of force as was necessary to prevent the prisoner from continuing his assault.</SPAN></P>

The company requested a declaratory judgment that the zoning resolution was unconstitutional, as well as a mandatory injunction that required the trustees to approve the zone changes. The trial court denied the company's amended complaint.

Appellants challenged the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees alleged that city police department promotions were going to be made on the basis of race and not on merit as required by the Ohio Constitution, Cleveland City Charter ch. 27, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 124. The trial court permanently enjoined the city from making promotions not based solely on merit. Appellants argue that the Cleveland City Charter controls the time within which certified police officers from promotional eligibility lists must be promoted and that the city's charter, ordinances, and that the Director of Public Safety has discretion under the Cleveland City Service Commission Rules to determine whether and when certified police officers should be promoted. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.44 controlled the timing of such appointments. The court held that, although the trial court erred in applying Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.44 to the appointments, the error was harmless. Under both the statute and Cleveland Civil Service Commission Rule 6.60, the Director of Public Safety was required to promote those police officers whose promotions were not challenged by appellees and did not violate state law.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause, opining that by removing the child from the mother and committing him to the Board, the lower court abused its discretion under Ohio Rev.

The court found sufficient evidence that the child was an abused minor, noting that the injuries he sustained while in the care of the mother's boyfriend were not consistent with the explanation provided by the boyfriend. The court concluded, however, that it was error to find that the mother had not provided the necessary care and supervision for the child when the record indicated she had no forewarning that her boyfriend would mistreat the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of armed robbery in an Ohio court of common pleas. In exchange, the State nolled one count of assault with intent to rob and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. The matter was before the court on a motion for a delayed appeal. Prior to the granting of the motion for a delayed appeal to the court, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the trial court, which that court overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced. Then he filed a motion for a delayed appeal. The motion was denied, and defendant's appeal from that decision was dismissed. Defendant then filed a second motion for a delayed appeal with the court. The court overruled the second motion. Later, defendant filed a motion requesting the court to reconsider its previous ruling. The motion was granted, and the notice of delayed appeal was accepted. It was the delayed appeal that was the subject of the case at bar. Meanwhile, defendant had initiated a post-conviction proceeding in the trial court. The trial court overruled the petition. Defendant stated that his plea of guilty was not knowingly and intelligently entered. The court found that defendant was barred under the doctrine of res judicata, from raising the issue in a delayed appeal from his conviction, because the issue had already been raised and litigated in a post-conviction proceeding. The other issues raised were not proper subjects for a post-conviction proceeding, because they could have been raised by means of a direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence of defendant were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had been involved in negotiations for a contract covering wages and conditions of employment. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants had been negotiating in bad faith and engaging in unfair labor practices.

The court held that: (1) it was possible for plaintiffs to prove a set of facts entitling them to relief, that a bargaining agreement had been entered into between the parties, the agreement was in effect, and the failure of the city to negotiate was a failure to perform the terms of the contract it had voluntarily undertaken; (2) the right of a municipality to determine the compensation of its employees was a power of local self-government; and (3) the trial court did not err in denying the equitable relief sought by plaintiffs because no statutory authority or ordinance provided that a policeman be paid a greater salary for a temporary promotion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant policeman sought review of a summary judgment entered in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) in favor of appellees, City of Strongsville, Administrator of the Bureau of Workers' Compensation (Ohio), and Industrial Commission of Ohio, in the policeman's action appealing the Commission's affirmance of a board of review's order affirming a hearing officer's order denying the policeman's claim for compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policeman was injured while driving a police vehicle and was paid three days sick leave by the City. Over seven years later, the policeman filed a motion that characterized the City's payment as temporary total disability benefits and sought participation in the workers' compensation fund. The Commission affirmed a hearing officer's determination that the City's payment did not constitute the payment of disability compensation and that the policeman's claim was therefore barred by the six-year limitation period contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52. The court ruled that &sect; 4123.52, which created a class of claimants subject to a 10-year limitations period and class of claimants subject to a six-year limitations period, did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, the equal protection provision, as applied to the policeman. The court further determined that the Commission correctly decided that the sick pay received by the policeman was not paid by the City in lieu of disability compensation and that the 10-year limitation period contained in &sect; 4123.52 was therefore never triggered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband challenged a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which granted a divorce to the former husband from appellee former wife and ordered a division of the marital assets of the parties including an award to the former wife of the former husband's interest in their marital residence as permanent alimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court entering the judgment of divorce, the husband filed three assignments of error. First, the husband argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3103.03 and 3105.18(B) were unconstitutional in that they denied males equal protection and due process of the law in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The constitutionality of the two statutes was not raised in the trial court. The court held that a reviewing court was not the place to raise for the first time a point which was not brought to the attention of the trial court during the trial of the matter. The court also concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the division of the marital assets or the award of alimony. While the wife was awarded the equity in the marital premises, as well as certain bank accounts, attorney fees, and personal property, the husband was awarded his stock plan, his pension, a bank account, the cash value of his insurance policy, and an automobile. In view of the trial court's conclusion that the wife was not capable of supporting herself, the division of assets and alimony award was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was treated for cancer by the physician in 1972 when the patient was 11 years old. No further treatment was provided, and the next contact between the parties occurred after the patient's 18th birthday. The patient filed a malpractice claim for the injuries he suffered for the alleged negligent radiation treatment, and his father filed a claim for the amount furnished by him for care, medical and other expenses of his son. The doctor moved for summary judgment based upon the statute of limitations, which the trial court granted as to both claims. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the patient's claim. On July 28, 1975, the effective date of the amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) that prohibited claims more than four years after their accrual, the patient was over 14 years old, and he had a vested substantive right under &sect; 2305.11 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16, which was not removed by the prospective operation of the amendment. The court affirmed the dismissal of the father's action because he could have brought a derivative action on behalf of the patient and his cause of action was not joint and inseparable from the patient's claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment with respect to the father's claim, reversed the judgment with respect to the patient's claim, and remanded that claim to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then filed the present motion for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied the motion, and the court affirmed that judgment. The court held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel by the dual representation at the arraignment because there was no substantial violation of any of his counsel's essential duties and defendant's defense was not prejudiced by the alleged ineffectiveness. The court also held that defendant failed to raise an objection to the dual representation in the trial court, which could have examined the possibility for conflict. The court also held that because a trial court was not required to, sua sponte, raise the issue and examine a possible conflict, and thus, defendant's motion was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and its city planning commission, appealed a judgment of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which reversed their order refusing an application to rezone. The trial court held that the refusal to rezone plaintiff landowners' property unreasonably interfered with the use of the property, amounted to a taking of the property without due process, and was unreasonable, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed an application to amend the zoning ordinance so that their property would be rezoned from residential use to commercial use. The city and its city planning commission refused to amend the zoning ordinance. The landowners filed a declaratory judgment action, and the trial court entered judgment for the landowners. The trial court found that the refusal to amend the zoning ordinance unreasonably interfered with the use of the property and amounted to a taking without due process. The court affirmed on appeal and held that the evidence supported the trial court's findings that the property was unsuitable for residential use and was suitable for commercial use. The evidence indicated that the property would have remained vacant and the landowners would have suffered substantial economic loss if it was not rezoned. The rezoning would have only a slight adverse effect on surrounding residences, and the landowners were willing to buy the surrounding houses and to put buffer strips on the borders of the property. The residential zoning classification had no relation to any public purpose and was constitutionally invalid as applied to the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

The court suggested that the landowners put in a buffer strip and that the remaining portion of the property be rezoned for commercial use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promoters planned to stage a nude beauty pageant at a convention center in the City. The City filed a complaint against the promoters, seeking a declaratory judgment that the conduct proposed by the promoters constituted a criminal act and an injunction enjoining the promoters from doing the unlawful act. The trial court granted the relief requested by the promoters. The promoters appealed on constitutional grounds. On appeal, the court held that the trial court could not have entertained the action for injunctive relief because it did not have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the promoters' conduct was unlawful. The record revealed that neither the promoters nor the City served the attorney general as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. Thus, the trial court should have dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. Because the trial court had no jurisdiction to declare the promoters' proposed act unlawful, it could not have granted injunctive relief to the City.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was the trial court's opinion that defendant's transgression was neither within the spirit or the letter of the law because a pedal power only bicycle was not a vehicle within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 and all doubt had to be resolved in his favor. On review, the court disagreed. The court held that there was no problem with the public interest in prohibiting persons from operating bicycles on the streets and highways while under the influence of alcohol. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 proscribed driving while intoxicated, included the word &quot;vehicle,&quot; and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.01(A) defined that word in such a fashion that a bicycle moved by human power was included. The court held that the prohibitions against operating a vehicle applied to persons operating bicycles while so influenced. The court disagreed with the trial court's finding, and held that the definition of bicycle in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.01(G) was not so facially vague that it did not meet constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

The court held that evidence of the incidents of a previous school year were properly admitted because evidence of prior misconduct was admissible to show the continuing nature of the employee's violation. The court also held that it could not substitute its judgment for the trial court's because the preponderance of the evidence supported the board's finding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant alleged that the trial court erred in (1) denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the charge of having a weapon under disability on the ground that Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12(C)(2) was not available to him. The court held that because there was nothing in the record indicating that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13 was unconstitutional, the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion to dismiss brought under &sect; 2923.13. The court also held that because defendant failed to make an affirmative demonstration pursuant to Ohio R. Crim.

Further, the court held that because there was no exception to the general admonition of Ohio Rev.

The applicant was denied benefit rights by the OBES, and the applicant appealed. The applicant filed a complaint-notice of appeal alleging that the OBES's decision should be reversed for the reason that said decision was unlawful, unreasonable, against the manifest weight of the evidence, and contrary to law. The applicant's appeal was dismissed, however, for failure to perfect an appeal. The applicant sought review on the grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.28(O) was violative of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Ohio Constitution and the U.S. Constitution and on the grounds that the common pleas court should have applied the Ohio Administrative Code, which provided that filing was completed upon mailing. The court affirmed because the record indicated that the applicant failed to raise either of these issues before the OBES.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in two cases appealed from the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio). In the first case, a corporation was convicted pursuant to its plea of no contest to a charge of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4303.293(A) by failing to make disclosures required in an application for a permit to sell intoxicating beverages. In the second case, an individual appealed from the overruling of his motion to dismiss a charge under the same section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation asserted that &sect; 4303.293 was unconstitutional and that the complaint failed to state an offense. The charge against the individual had been dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement but the individual also asserted on appeal that &sect; 4303.2903 was unconstitutional. The court found that the corporation's plea of no contest admitted the allegation in the complaint that it had omitted the name of an individual who had a &quot;legal beneficial or financial interest&quot; in the business. The court held, however, that this admission was insufficient to establish a violation of &sect; 4303.293(A) in that the statute required the disclosure of each person having a &quot;legal or beneficial ownership of the business&quot; and that having an &quot;interest&quot; in a business amounted to something less than &quot;ownership&quot; of a business. In light of this determination, the court found it unnecessary to address the corporation's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute. The court further declined to consider this issue with respect to the individual defendant on the grounds that the charge against him had been dismissed and, therefore, he had not been prejudiced by the trial court's denial of his motion..</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal of the individual, reversed the judgment of the court of common pleas against the corporation, and remanded the cause for further proceedings according to law and consistent with its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendant corporation appealed an order of the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which upon the corporation's plea of no contest convicted it of failing to make disclosures required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4303.293 in applying for a permit to sell intoxicating beverages. Defendant individual appealed an order of the trial court overruling his motion to dismiss on the grounds that &sect; 4303.293 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that under &sect; 4303.293, any person making application concerning a permit to conduct a business for which a permit was required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4303 was to list on the application the name and address of each person having a legal or beneficial ownership of the business. The court agreed with the corporation that the complaint, which alleged that the corporation failed to list on its application the name and address of a person having a legal beneficial or financial interest in the business, failed to state an offense. The court held that, in keeping with common understanding of the words, an interest in a business amounted to having something less than ownership of a business. Therefore, the State, in relying on the corporation's admission in the form of its no contest plea that it failed to list a person having an interest in the business, did not prove a violation of &sect; 4303.293. The court concluded that the trial court's ruling on the individual's motion to dismiss was not prejudicial to the individual because the trial court ultimately dismissed the charges lodged against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the individual's appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in Bedford Municipal Court (Ohio) of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant came to the mall to retrieve his son who had been in trouble with the security guards. He was very loud and quarrelsome. The officers eventually arrested him and charged him with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. The court found that the trespass ordinance was not applied so as to abridge defendant's First Amendment rights. The mall security room was not open to the public as was the Mall shopping area. Therefore, the property owner's agents were with in their rights to preserve this area for private use without infringing the constitutional rights of unauthorized members of the public. However, the court held that the disorderly conduct ordinance was applied so as to unconstitutionally abridge defendant's First Amendment freedom of expression. The record showed that defendant's conduct and remarks were not, beyond a reasonable doubt, injurious or likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence for disorderly conduct was reversed, and he was discharged as to this offense.

Defendant contended that there was no proof that he had possessed a controlled substance, his motion to suppress the State's exhibits should have been granted, and the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant offered to sell drugs to a gas station attendant by presenting him with a list of what was available. He also provided the attendant with a list for reference should he know of anyone that wanted drugs. The attendant told the police, who arrested defendant for a violation of &sect; 2925.03(A)(1). At the time, defendant was not carrying any drugs, and the lists were found a month later behind the gasoline station. A jury returned a guilty verdict. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant committed a crime when the offer was made; thus, no delivery was required. The court noted that there was ample proof of defendant's &quot;present ability&quot; to deliver the drugs. Moreover, there was sufficient evidence that defendant had offered to sell the drugs with no indication that it was made in jest or simply to defraud the attendant. The court also ruled that &sect; 2925.03(A)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate defendant's right of free speech. Finally, the court determined that the attendant's testimony was sufficient to authenticate the lists of drugs that defendant threw out at the station; thus, they were admissible evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for the city. Appellants requested a review. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court found that the trial court did not err. The court found that the trial court properly concluded summary judgment was not appropriate. The court determined that the trial court's failure to rule on appellants' motion to dismiss was harmless error where it had ruled on the merits of the case, which made the motion moot. Appellants waived their right to challenge the technical defects in the city ordinances when they accepted the benefits. The court found the trial court's order was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court determined appellants' equal protection and due process rights were not violated by the ordinance where there was not offer to show an arbitrary and intentionally unfair discrimination in the application of the ordinance. The court stated the administration of the ordinance was not a ministerial duty and therefore a writ of mandamus was inapplicable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village sought review of a judgment from the Miami County Municipal Court (Ohio), sustaining defendant's two motions to dismiss a complaint charging him with falsely reporting his vehicle stolen while within the village limits, in violation of Village of Covington, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 130.09. Defendant cross-appealed the overruling of his motion to dismiss the complaint because he did not waive his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a finding of guilty in the mayor's court, defendant appealed to the trial court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1905.25. The trial court found that defendant was denied due process by having to stand trial before a non-lawyer judge and because he was not brought to trial within the time specified by law. On further appeal, the court found that defendant waived a jury trial by not demanding it in writing as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 23(A). Defendant's trial by the mayor, vested with broad executive powers and responsibilities, was a situation in which an official occupied two practically and seriously inconsistent positions, and necessarily involved a lack of due process. Accordingly, the trial of defendant, charged with violation of a village ordinance by a mayor acting as judge, violated due process of law. The mayor was also the chief executive officer and was responsible for the financial condition of the village. Although the trial court improperly discharged defendant on the ground that he was not brought to trial within the time specified by law, it did not err in dismissing the complaint because of the denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of landowners with property adjacent to an area that was being annexed to a city brought an action that sought to enjoin the annexation of the land. The lower court found in favor of the County Commissioners and the court affirmed. The landowners argued that the annexation would have prevented them from raising poultry, maintaining their businesses, and from hunting on their land. The court found these reasons were insufficient to prevent annexation because the ordinance concerning poultry did not prevent them from keeping confined animals; upon annexation, the area would maintain the zoning it had while part of the county; and the right to hunt was not sufficient to reverse the County Commissioners. The court held that the freedom to avoid taxation was not a recognized or protectable legal interest. The court held that the County Commissioner's failure to act on the annexation petition within the 90 day period of time required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033 had not deprived them of jurisdiction and the landowners had not been prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that they could consider sections of the disorderly conduct ordinance other than the unreasonable noise section, in determining whether his arrest was lawful. The court determined that such an instruction was not an error because the pertinent question was whether the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were juveniles, were involved in an incident in which one victim was stabbed and a second victim was killed. The State charged defendants with aggravated murder, felonious assault, and conspiracy, but the jury only convicted defendants on the felonious assault count. Defendants challenged the trial court's instruction to the jury. The court found that the trial court's conspiracy instruction, requiring an actual agreement to commit felonious assault plus knowing involvement in the crime, clearly included the element of common design. Thus, while the instruction was technically incorrect, it could validly have provided the basis for defendants' convictions of felonious assault on a theory of complicity. Defendants argued that the trial court violated their right to a speedy trial because of the failure of the trial court to apply Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.71-.73 from the date of their initial arrests, rather from when they were bound over as adults to the trial court.

The property owner stated that she owned three dogs and desired to own and keep more in pursuit of her hobby of dog breeding. The trial court ruled that &sect; 905.04(H)(1) as applied to the property owner was constitutional. The ruling was affirmed. The court found that the property owner had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that &sect; 905.04(H)(1) was either unreasonable or arbitrary, or that it did not bear a real and substantial relationship to the public safety and general welfare of the public. The only evidence the property owner submitted that was probative of the issue was the affidavit of the president of a dog breeding association.

The operator's appeal to the lower court was brought under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12, which required a confinement to the record as certified to it by the agency. The lower court could have considered additional evidence only if such evidence was newly discovered and was not available prior to the Director's hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and others, sought review of the grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff property owners in the Lorain County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), in consolidated proceedings involving the owners' appeal of a zoning board decision and the owners' declaratory judgment action seeking, inter alia, a declaration of their rights under an allegedly unconstitutional ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners filed an appeal from a zoning board decision and a declaratory judgment action. The actions were consolidated. A city planning commission, allegedly in reliance on a recently enacted ordinance limiting the size and weight of vehicles passing over an access road to the owners' property, had denied the owners' application for a building permit. The declaratory judgment action sought a declaration of the owners' rights under the allegedly unconstitutional ordinance. That action also sought a declaration as to whether the city, which allegedly lacked a certified building department, had the jurisdiction to consider the issuance of a building permit. The owners' summary judgment motion was granted. As to the declaratory judgment action, the court found that the trial court failed to determine the constitutional issue raised by the owners; that is, whether the ordinance was constitutionally invalid as applied to the owners. In addition, that there was no appealable order as to the zoning board appeal. The matter was remanded for a determination as to the disposition of the appeal and a determination of the unresolved constitutional issues in the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court regarding the declaratory judgment action and remanded for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The skate park was the only such establishment in the city. It began offering late skate nights on Friday and Sunday nights, when the rink would remain open Friday nights until 3 a.m. and Sunday nights until 1 a.m. The city subsequently passed an ordinance requiring skating rinks to be licensed and limiting their hours to midnight every night. The city based its action on its police power, claiming the late night sessions were poorly supervised and had led to numerous complaints to the police. The city allowed bowling alleys to stay open to 2:30 a.m., and dance halls and bars to stay open until 3:00 a.m. The skate park argued that the ordinance was unreasonable and unconstitutional in that the lost profits would damage the business. The trial court found the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the police power and was therefore constitutionally valid. On appeal the court reversed, holding that the ordinances did not bear a real and substantial relationship to the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community. The court found that the few instances of rowdyism, minor vandalism, and thefts requiring police action did not justify closing the rink at midnight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and entered final judgment for the skate park, declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03, the trial court overruled the motion, which order gave rise to defendant's first assignment of error, stated as: The trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant in applying the limitation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the killing of a person at defendant's home. Defendant's theory at trial and on appeal was that he acted in self-defense because the victim was attacking his home and threatening the lives of the people therein. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to find for him on the issue of self-defense. The court held that the trial court was correct in rejecting the defense of self-defense because in order for the defense to apply, the slayer must not have been at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray. There was evidence that defendant called the victim's residence numerous times that day and that he invited the victim to come to his home only a short time after the two had been in a fight, which defendant had lost. Further, because defendant had been drinking heavily on the day in question, he failed to meet the requirement that a slayer's reasonable belief that the killing was necessary must be grounded upon a careful and proper use of his faculties. Lastly, there was no evidence that the victim ever actually tried to enter defendant's house or that he was armed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was stopped and was issued a citation for operating a motor vehicle using the license plates from another vehicle in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.08(C). Defendant entered a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; to the offense charged in the citation. Trial was held and defendant was found guilty. The court found that there was no question that defendant violated &sect; 4549.08(C) since, on the date he was cited for violating the statute he did not have title to the 1964 truck and, in fact, title to that truck was not transferred to him until 35 days after he was cited. The court also found that &sect; 4549.08(C), as applied to the facts in this case, was constitutional and was a proper exercise of the state's police powers, since it provided a reasonable basis of identifying a particular vehicle and owner by the license plates attached to said vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The landowner obtained the required approvals from the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission and Rural Planning Commission, but the Board denied the application. The landowner appealed to the trial court, which, after a bench trial, affirmed the decision of the Board. The landowner appealed and the court reversed the decision and remanded the cause for a new trial, finding that it was error for the trial court to admit into evidence testimony that indicated the property could be developed in accordance with an alternate plan that the Board had requisitioned. The alternate plan had not been before the Board when it considered and denied the landowner's proposal and it was the trial court's duty to rule on the propriety of the Board's decision based upon the information the Board had before it at the time. The court concluded that the trial court did apply the proper standard in ruling upon the landowner's plan and that there was a sufficient basis for the trial court to determine that certain requirements of Art.

The State was not required to present the gun to the court as evidence or to prove that it could actually fire a projectile because the evidence was such that the deadly nature of the gun could be inferred from the facts and circumstances of its use in the crime. Defendant's claim that he was entitled to know whether the evidence against him was based upon his conduct as a principal offender or as an aider and abettor under Ohio Rev.

The court concluded that in order to determine the specifics of the evidence against him defendant could have filed a motion for a bill of particulars under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7 (E).

Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court determined that the ordinance did not violate the grant of home rule powers found in the first part of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3; that the city validly acted within its police powers when it enacted the ordinance because the legislative findings demonstrated a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare; and that both the findings and the prohibitions of the ordinance were reasonable and neither capricious nor arbitrary. The court further ruled that the ordinance gave sufficient notice of the conduct forbidden and therefore was not vague, that the ordinance was not unduly oppressive or transcended what was necessary to protect the public welfare, and that the city did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection because it was reasonable to prohibit pinball machines while allowing the use of playing cards or pool tables in commercial establishments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was a history of discord between the officer and the city's police chief. Based on the chief's recommendations, the city manager suspended the officer for insubordination and he discharged the officer for unsatisfactory job performance and insubordination. The commission affirmed the decisions in part. The officer filed appeals to the trial court, and the city filed a cross-appeal. The appeals were consolidated. The trial court entered a judgment reversing the finding that the officer was insubordinate, and it affirmed the officer's dismissal for unsatisfactory performance. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action to the trial court with instructions to remand the matter to the commission for a new hearing. The court held that the commission denied the officer fundamental fairness and due process of law because a commissioner, who disqualified himself on the ground that he could not remain fair and impartial, continued to participate in the proceedings. The court overruled the city's assignment of error because the commission failed to advise the officer of his right under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district's board had been paying the parents an annual fee in lieu of transportation. However the parents sought the actual transportation, but the board failed to grant the requested relief, arguing that it was impractical to do so. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that neither the state board of education nor the parents of children attending non-public schools in the public school districts surrounding the district were necessary parties under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2721.12 to the action. The court reasoned that the failure to join the state board of education and the parents of children who attended non-public schools in the surrounding school districts did not preclude the trial court from fashioning a complete and appropriate remedy among those already party. Further the court reasoned that the failure to join the above named parties would not have subjected the persons already parties to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations because there was only mere speculation that the school district would incur multiple lawsuits as a result of the present one.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2107.06, because it was executed within six months of the testator's death. The trial court found that a bequest made to a church exceeded twenty-five percent of the value of the net probate estate and should have been abated in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.06(H).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor filed a complaint and sought to determine the applicability of Ohio Rev.

The executor argued that the future interest given to the church under the testator's will must be valued as of the date of testator's death in determining whether that future interest exceeded 25 percent of the testator's net probate estate for the purposes of &sect; 2107.06. The court held that in determining whether the value of a particular testamentary gift exceeded 25 percent of a testator's net probate estate for the purposes of &sect; 2107.06, a trial court must value the gift as of the date of the testator's death. Where the gift was given in the form of a remainder or other future interest, the value of the interest must be assessed as of the testator's death. The record did not indicate the method employed by the trial court in deciding that the value of the church's future interest exceeded 25 percent of the testator's net probate estate. The court found that the interest did not exceed the 25 percent value limitation of &sect; 2107.06.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife, who was a passenger in an automobile driven by appellee husband, brought a negligence action against him in the Common Pleas Court (Ohio) following an accident that took place in Vermont. After the common pleas court granted summary judgment for the husband, the wife appealed, claiming in part that the doctrine of lex loci delecti should have been applied and that the doctrine of interspousal immunity was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Vermont law permitted negligence actions between spouses, and the wife urged that the doctrine of lex loci delecti applied to permit her action against the husband, even though they were married and lived in Ohio. In considering her appeal, the court disagreed, ruling that Ohio's public policy expressly prohibited the maintenance of a negligence action between spouses. The rote application of the lex loci delecti doctrine had been abandoned in favor of a more flexible approach in which a court looked to the laws of the state that had the most significant relationship to the parties and the most dominant interest in resolving the dispute. The application of lex loci delecti was abandoned when public policy considerations were part of the judicial resolution of the conflict. The court determined that the parties had remained married residents of Ohio. That the accident was in Vermont thus was incidental and had little or no bearing on Ohio's paramount, continuing interest over their marriage relationship. Accordingly, the court ruled that under the facts, Ohio's public policy took precedence over that of Vermont, and summary judgment for the husband was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the wife's assignments of error and affirmed the grant of summary judgment for the husband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Industrial Commission of Ohio appealed a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which declared that a 1977 amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.515 was substantive, rather than procedural, and could not be applied with respect to workers' compensation claims that accrued prior to January 17, 1977. The trial court sustained a motion for summary judgment by plaintiffs, a class of Ohio employers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the application of the 1977 amendment would have constituted retroactive legislation and was therefore violative of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. On appeal, the Commission contended that the 1977 amendment could not be given retroactive effect so as to create new rights or impose new duties with respect to claims that had accrued prior to January 1, 1977, the effective date of the amendment. The employers claimed that the amended statute placed new burdens upon them. The court ruled that the effect of the statute was prospective only in that only future contribution rates would be affected. The court held that the trial court erred in finding the 1977 amendment to be substantive in nature; rather, as to employers, the statute was purely remedial and procedural. As a result, the 1977 amendment did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 18. The court concluded that the 1977 amendment could have no effect with respect to claims pending before January 17, 1977. All claims pending at that time were to be controlled by the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.515 as it read prior to the 1977 amendment with respect to the payment of compensation and benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding that a justiciable controversy existed as to the construction and constitutionality of the amended statute, the court reversed the judgment. The court remanded the cause to the trial court with instructions to enter a declaratory judgment in accordance with law consistent with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants applied for a permit to construct a car wash on their property.

On appeal of the trial court's judgment dismissing the action, the court observed that the surrounding property was all zoned residential with the exception of the lessor's and lessee's car dealership business directly across the street from the subject property. The court declined to disturb the trial court's decision that the zoning ordinance bore a substantial relation to the Village's desire to prevent encroachment of commercial use into the area across the dividing line formed by the street, noting that the principle of non-encroachment was a valid reason for upholding zoning laws.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner filed an action in the trial court (Ohio) against appellee township, seeking a declaratory judgment that Russell Township, Ohio, Zoning Regulations &sect; 4.6(g) was unconstitutional because it wrongly prohibited the construction of landing strips as an accessory use to a permitted residential use. After the trial court declared that the ordinance was constitutional, the property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had unsuccessfully sought a zoning permit for the construction of a personal residence and a private, noncommercial, grass airstrip on his land. In considering his appeal, the court agreed with his argument that townships had no right to enact a regulation that prohibited any landing strips or airports. That was so because in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4561.06 (1947), the state legislature had codified its policy of promoting aviation and the establishment of airports. The court ruled that a private landing strip was an airport under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4561.01(C). Further, Russell Township, Ohio, Zoning Regulations &sect; 4.6(g), which prohibited all airports, whether commercial or for private purposes as an accessory to another permitted use, was outside the township's police power and thus invalid. The court also concluded that the question of private landing fields as an accessory use to another permitted use was not a debatable question.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the State met its burden that concerned a bulk amount because an expert testified that the drugs in evidence were in the same size and form as in earlier cases and because a compound, mixture, or preparation that was separately identifiable and was in a form that indicated it was meant as a single dose was a unit dose; (2) the trial court did not err in giving its jury instruction on the issue of defendant's complicity where a defendant might be convicted on the basis of his complicity in a crime even though the indictment charged only the principal offense; (3) defendant's claim of entrapment was a determination of credibility as between defendant and his story and two undercover police officers and their story and was a matter for the trial jury's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant village sought review of the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted the motion to dismiss of appellees, landfill operators, an environmental protection agency, a state attorney general, and a county board of health, in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village filed a complaint alleging that the operators did not have a valid state license and that the landfill operation violated Brooklyn Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 153.07 and certain environmental regulations. Thereafter, the agency and the operators filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The trial court granted the motion as to all parties on the grounds of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and standing. The court held that the majority of the village's claims, including the validity of the operators' license and regulation violations, were within the jurisdiction of the environmental board of review. However, the complaint further alleged a violation of &sect; 153.07 and sought a declaration that the ordinance prohibited any landfill operations within the village. The trial court clearly had jurisdiction over, and the village standing to assert, this claim. Further, the proper time to assert any affirmative defenses was on remand because the alleged violation of &sect; 153.07 was not an issue dispositive of the merits of the appeal. Finally, the complaint contained no allegations of any zoning code violation resulting from the operators' maintenance of a landfill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision was affirmed as to the agency, the attorney general, the board, and as to the dismissal of the village's claims concerning the validity of the operators' license to operate the landfill and the operators' compliance with environmental regulations. The trial court's decision was reversed with respect to the dismissal of the claim concerning the operators' alleged violation of a village anti-dumping ordinance.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that as a matter of law the injury did not qualify as a substantial risk of serious physical harm under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the common pleas court erred in accepting a written waiver of jury form without first inquiring of him the circumstances under which the waiver was made, the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, the evidence failed to satisfy the due process standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the indictments denied defendant due process of law by not providing adequate notice of the charges against him, and the sentence was an abuse of discretion and was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed the convictions, but remanded the sentence for modification. Though the common pleas court referred to the statutory aggregate minimum sentence when it announced its decision, it did not incorporate the 15-year minimum sentence in its final journal entry. Defendant merely waived a jury, the prescribed procedure was complied with and the waiver was presumptively knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The evidence supported the verdicts. By failing to object to the indictments, defendant did not preserve his right to appeal them. The common pleas court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences for the attempted murder charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed an action for negligent failure to diagnose his daughter's condition against the doctors on November 14, 1978. His daughter was 16 years old. The trial court granted the doctors' motion for summary judgment, finding that the statute of limitations barred the action. On appeal, the court held that the doctors did not waive the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations by failing to assert it in their initial answers. Ohio R. Civ. P. 15(A) permitted them to amend their answers. The one-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11 was tolled for a minor under the age of 10 until the minor reached 14. The child terminated treatment from one doctor on May 16, 1974, when she was eleven years old. The statute ran as to this doctor on July 28, 1976. The tolling of her claim stopped at the point her legal disability of minority or mental incapacity was removed. The other doctor last saw the child in 1964. Because there was no continuing physician/patient relationship with the other doctor since 1964, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) (amended 1975) allowed an action against him only until she turned 14.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a patron in a bar while attempting to rob him. Defendant complained that the jury charge was deficient in that the trial court failed to instruct on all the elements of a theft offense which were pertinent to the definition of aggravated robbery, both as a principal offense and as an element of aggravated murder. The court held that because defendant's counsel failed to object to the given instructions, defendant had waived a challenge to the instructions except as to plain error. The court further held that while there were certain omissions in the instructions, these omissions did not constitute plain error. The court held that the trial court's instruction on causation was proper because it created no presumption as to the degree of culpability not could it have been interpreted by a reasonable juror as creating any such presumption. The court held that defendant's counsel was not ineffective because he had not breached an essential duty to defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of a common pleas court (Ohio), which after a jury trial convicted him of two counts of attempted murder pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.02, 2923.02, and sentenced him to four to 25 years per count, concurrently. He claimed that it was error to instruct that he had to disprove facts established by the State, to instruct that he had to prove self-defense, and that the evidence did not support the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he shot two men in self-defense after one of them fired a gun at him following an argument at a club. At trial, the jury was instructed that a purpose to kill could be inferred from the use of a weapon, that proof of a motive was not required, and that a good motive or purpose was not a defense. On review, the court found that the instruction was proper because it did not contain a presumption affecting the burden of proof. The court found that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A), stating the presumption of innocence and placing the burden of an affirmative defense upon an accused by a preponderance of the evidence, was constitutional, and that defendant presented evidence that, if believed, could have sustained a finding of self-defense which was refuted by the State's evidence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11(A)(2). Defendant's motion to suppress the assault victim's identification testimony was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress alleged that he was denied counsel at the lineup in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI; that the lineup identification was unduly suggestive in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV; and that his in-court identification by the assault victim had no source independent of the constitutionally infirm lineup identification. Defendant sought to suppress both his pretrial identification and the in-court identification. The court held on appeal that defendant was entitled to the assistance of counsel at the lineup unless he waived that right. Because the required warnings were not affirmatively shown to have been made to him, the court held that the lineup identification was tainted. However, the in-court identification was independent of the lineup identification. The trial court violated defendant's due process rights by refusing to allow him to call a patrolman to testify that someone else may have committed the offenses charged. The trial court also erred by denying defendant the right to cross-examine a State's witness before the jury. Finally, the trial court failed to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03 with respect to the jury verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clerk argued that because none of the signatories to the petition had inserted their precinct number following their signature and address on the petition, the candidate's petitioners were invalid.

Code Ann. &sect; 731.31, the signatories were required to insert their precinct number on the petition. The court found that the question of determining sufficiency included examining the face of a petition to determine if the signatory affixed his ward and precinct number. The court held that this review was an administrative function relating to form of the petition and was mandatory. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found that requiring registered voters to designate ward and precinct numbers on referendum petitions pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court granted the motion and found that the municipal code constituted an unlawful and unconstitutional restraint upon interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two officers went into the store where defendants worked and observed the store displays and peep shows. Thereafter, the officers returned to the store accompanied by two representatives from the Canton City Law Department. At that time, one officer made several purchases. Defendant one rang up the purchases while the defendant two helped fill the film boxes. On appeal, defendants argued that Canton, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 533.12, which provided that pandering obscenity was a misdemeanor of the first degree, was unconstitutional. First, the court noted that the text of the Canton Ordinance sections dealing with obscenity were identical to the state statute on the same subject. Next, the court held that the state statute dealing with obscenity was constitutional where authoritatively construed to incorporate the prescribed guidelines. The court then held that the trial court properly incorporated the guidelines into defendants' case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee held a bachelor's degree in psychology and was employed in the state civil service commission and had experience in the field. Statutes were passed regulating the field of psychology requiring licensure by examination. The statutes included a grandfather clause that permitted those with experience to practice without a license if specified qualifications under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4732.10. The Board, which was directed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4732.02 to administer the statutes, denied the employee's request to be considered an exception to the licensure requirement and the trial court affirmed the denial. The employee appealed. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly determined that the Board's denial of the exemption was not arbitrary or capricious. The hearing at which the denial of the exemption was denied was properly held. Sufficient notice of the intent to change the and the statutes under which the licensure was required was granted to those in the field. The Board did not discriminate against the applicant because the valid law was applied to her properly and she did not qualify for the exemption under the statutes as written.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company owned an island, which was connected to the mainland by a causeway. In 1977, landowners on the island successfully sought an injunction to prevent the company from carrying on quarrying operations. The company then brought a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the zoning regulations of the township declared unconstitutional. The trial court found that the company's action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court found that in the injunction action brought against the company by the landowners, the company could have asserted both the defense that quarrying was permitted as a nonconforming use and the defense that the zoning ordinances of the township were unconstitutional as applied to its land. The court also found that mutuality existed between the parties in the prior injunction action and the instant action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the Board's action, holding that the requisite four years work experience had to be obtained between the time the act was passed and the time that the grandfather clause expired and that the residency requirement was a valid &quot;reward&quot; for holders of master's degrees who lived in Ohio and practiced psychology in the state. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered that the license be issued, holding that the residency requirement had no rational bearing on the applicant's qualification, was as barren of reason as that struck down in earlier case law, violated equal protection, and was void.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that the parties' divorce was clear and that the father only had to pay child support until the children reached age 18 or were emancipated; there was no provision for completion of high school. Furthermore, the mother never sought a modification of the divorce decree to allow support until the children completed high school pursuant to &sect; 3101.03.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue were whether: (1) the approval of a CUP under the Resolution was a legislative act subject to referendum; (2) the Resolution was invalid because it improperly delegated legislative authority; and (3) the Board's Resolution No. 575, which approved the company's CUP, was illegal because it improperly delegated legislative authority and was based on a preliminary, rather than a final, plan. The court answered all questions in the negative and reversed. The Board's approval of the CUP by adoption of the Resolution was an administrative act not subject to referendum because it was a step in the application of a zoning regulation already in existence. It did not expressly change the underlying zoning, and the court inferred no such change was intended because the Board found that the average area per dwelling of the CUP was not less than the lot area per family required by the resolution. Further, the Resolution fell within the authority of the enabling statute and properly delegated authority to subordinate boards in a constitutional manner; the zoning regulations contained standards and guidelines that were sufficiently definite to meet the constitutional test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment declaring the zoning resolutions to be invalid, and remanded the matter for rendering of a final judgment declaring the zoning resolutions to be valid and legal in all respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's arrest for the offense of domestic violence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2912.25, his wife obtained a temporary protection order against him pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.26. The Clermont County Court (Ohio) denied defendant's motion for discharge on the ground that the statutory framework underlying the charge against him was unconstitutional. Defendant was convicted and sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 and its companion provisions, which stated the grounds for the arrest and pre-trial release of a person charged with the offense of domestic violence. He argued that the provision for the issuance of a temporary protection order against the offending spouse as a condition of pre-trial release was a denial of the right to bail. He also argued that the failure to impose a statutory burden of proof in hearings on motions for temporary protective orders was a deprivation of due process. Finally, defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03(B), stating the grounds for a lawful arrest on a domestic violence charge, violated the principle that a person was presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in an adversarial proceeding. The court held that defendant did not raise the constitutionality of the statutory scheme or the lack of a statutory burden of proof in the trial court so the issues were not considered. Section 2935.03 did nothing more than state traditional standards of probable cause to arrest and apply such standards to the offense of domestic violence.</SPAN></P>
