The insurer paid the insured under a policy and brought a subrogation action against the transit authority and its employee. The transit authority and its employee brought a motion to dismiss the complaint asserting that the insurer was precluded from bringing a subrogation action against a political subdivision and its employee by the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B), which allowed reduction of an award against a political subdivision for any insurance proceeds recovered by the injured party. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the Ohio Supreme Court had held that the statute was a constitutional exercise of legislative authority under the equal protection clauses of the United States and Ohio constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found defendant guilty of trafficking in marijuana, a fourth degree felony, after defendant pleaded guilty to the charge. The trial court sentenced defendant to 18 months in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him for trafficking in marijuana without considering the mitigating factors in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02. Defendant argued that he should have received probation because he committed a &quot;victimless&quot; crime by cultivating the marijuana plants for personal consumption rather than sale. The court found that defendant was afforded the opportunity to present the same &quot;evidence&quot; to the trial court during sentencing. Independently, cultivation of marijuana, regardless of its intended use, whether for recreational use or for resale, was prohibited by law. The statute afforded no greater protection to those who did so for personal pleasure than for financial gain. The sentence was within the statutory limits. The court also presumed that the trial court considered the report prepared by the probation department as there was no showing to contrary in the record. The court then held that a sentence, as here, that fell within the terms of a valid statute could not amount to cruel and unusual punishment as claimed by defendant. Defendant also failed to provide any authority that a sentence of 18 months was disproportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of one count of pandering obscenity in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The undercover detective purchased tokens from defendant and watched part of a video in an adult bookstore. The trial court convicted defendant pandering obscenity. The court affirmed and remanded. Reasonable minds could come to different conclusions of whether the evidence raised the inference of defendant's dominion and control over the videotape and its use. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motions for acquittal. The court found that the trial court correctly instructed the jury relative to the assignment and that, as used in conjunction with the Miller test, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.01 and 2907.32 were not unconstitutionally applied. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence as there was no prior restraint. The trial court was correct in not granting defendant's motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel as there was no mutuality of the parties with the prior action. In consideration of the mandatory duty by the trial court, the court found that the trial court erred in failing to afford defendant an opportunity to exercise his right to elocution prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court reversed the court's affirmance of defendant's conviction for 14 counts of rape, aggravated burglary, two counts of aggravated robbery, aggravated assault, attempted rape, and gross sexual imposition and remanded his appeal. Each count carried a firearms specification. Additionally, the jury found defendant guilty of possessing a firearm under disability as to felonious assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court found that the court denied defendant his constitutional right to appeal by allowing his counsel to withdraw and refusing to appoint new counsel. On remand, he made assignments of error concerning the racial composition of the jury, the trial court's instructions concerning sexual offenses and complicity, and the trial court's omission of the deadly weapon/dangerous ordinance element from its charge on felonious assault. There were also assignments of error concerning the operability of a firearm and the instructions pertaining to that matter. His last assignment was upon the trial court's failure to follow the jury's finding that he had a prior felony conviction. The court found that the trial court erred when it ignored the jury's finding that defendant had not been previously convicted of felonious assault as to one count. The jury concluded in its verdict on that count that he had not been previously convicted of felonious assault. Thus the trial judge should not have enhanced the sentence on that count as the findings of the jury mitigated against enhancement on the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the sentence imposed on the felonious assault count of the indictment and as so modified, the judgment convicting and sentencing defendant for rape, aggravated burglary, two counts of aggravated robbery, aggravated assault, attempted rape, and gross sexual imposition was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight defendants appealed from separate judgments by the Springfield Municipal Court (Ohio) finding them guilty of operating overloaded vehicles on improved public highways. Their appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were dump truck drivers who were stopped and issued &quot;overweight&quot; citations. On appeal they argued that the trial court erred in overruling their motions to suppress evidence, in failing to direct verdicts in favor of them, and in imposing a driver's license suspension of one year as a portion of the sentences. The court addressed each case. While the citing officer's stop of some of the vehicles met the requirements of the Fourth Amendment and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.33 as the officer had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that the trucks were overweight, the stops of other vehicles were unconstitutional as there was no evidence in the record, other than the officer's conclusory statement, to indicate that he had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that those vehicles were unsafe or in violation of safety laws. In two of the cases, as the State failed to prove an essential element of the crime charged, they were entitled to directed verdicts. The trial court erred in imposing a driver's license suspension of one year because the penalty provisions of the Revised Code relating to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5577.04 did not provide for driver's license suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments in the cases of four defendants finding them guilty of operating overloaded vehicles on improved public highways. That part of the judgment in the case of one defendant in which his driver's license was suspended for a year was reversed, but in all other respects the judgment in that case was affirmed. The court reversed the judgments against three defendants and they were ordered discharged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality passed a resolution declaring the necessity of appropriating property belonging to the owners and an ordinance appropriating the property for the stated purpose of relocating a street and for other unspecified purposes.

At an evidentiary hearing, the municipality claimed that the excess appropriation was needed as a buffer zone for the relocated street, but the trial court found that the true purpose of the appropriation was to assist a business that leased a building on the appropriated parcel of land with an expansion plan. The court affirmed the judgment. Competent, credible evidence supported the trial court's findings that the excess appropriation was not for public purposes and was not justified and that the municipality abused its discretion in making the appropriation. The trial court properly found that the appropriation ordinance did not meet the specificity requirements of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 10 and Ohio Rev.

The trial court originally dismissed the inmates' action, but the court reversed that decision and remanded the case. On remand, the trial court granted the state health care administrator's motion for summary judgment, and the inmates appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.02(F) (1987). The court ruled that &sect; 2743.02(F) applied retrospectively even though there was no express wording in the statute.&nbsp;Section 2743.02(F) was passed by the general assembly to make clear that a court of claims had exclusive jurisdiction in actions against state officers and employers and that the statute was to be applied retrospectively and prospectively. Section 2743.02(F) was remedial in nature and was not barred by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. It only dealt with procedure and did not operate to bar any substantive rights of the inmates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of violating an ordinance that prohibited parking in a setback area.

The court disagreed. The evidence supported the trial court's judgment in that there was conflicting evidence as to the nonconforming use of the property, and it was up to the trial judge to assess the credibility of witnesses and resolve the conflicts presented by the evidence. The ordinance's reference to use of yards was not so vague and ambiguous as to render it unconstitutional, and defendant presented no evidence to overcome the presumption of legality of the ordinance that prohibited the parking of various automobiles in the front yard of a residential property. The ordinance came within the police power of the municipality and was designed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.</SPAN></P>

The Common Pleas Court, Guernsey County (Ohio), allowed the jury to determine the amount of punitive damages awarded against the dealer, and denied the dealer's motions for summary judgment, a directed verdict, a new trial, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The dealer appealed from the resulting judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers claimed that the dealer sold automobiles advertised as &quot;factory official cars,&quot; when in fact they had been previously owned by rental companies and used by them as rental cars. The court held that the type of conduct proved in the case quite reasonably could have been considered as a malicious fraud. Further, the claim that the trial court should have entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict upon the issue of accord and satisfaction was without support in the record. Moreover, the claim that it was error to allow the jury to determine the amount of punitive damages, and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2315.18 and 2315.21(C)(2) were unconstitutional, was without merit. Finally, the claim that punitive damages must have been established and found to exist by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to the applicable section of the so-called &quot;Tort Reform Act&quot; effective January 5, 1988, the same being Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2315.21(C)(3), was not raised in the trial court and would not be considered upon appeal. The effective date of the statute was after the acts involved in the lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

His prior requests for release under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.40 were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a prior refusal of defendant's requests for release was affirmed on appeal, defendant again sought and was denied release under Ohio Rev.

The State's expert witness diagnosed defendant as bipolar and depressed, following similar diagnoses by other mental health professionals; defendant's expert witnesses conceded that the diagnoses represented substantial, chronic mental disorders. The court considered the cause of defendant's remission and the probability that he would continue treatment on release and noted that his illness was exacerbated by stress and was periodic in nature, that he claimed not to be mentally ill, and that there was little evidence of his remorse. There was a &quot;substantial likelihood&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.01(B) that his release would result in physical harm to others.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contemnor challenged the judgment of the probate division of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, Ohio, which held contemnor in contempt for failing to appear at a court ordered examination by appellee estate administrator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2109.50. The issue was whether the probate court could find the contemnor in contempt and whether the financial sanction imposed was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contemnor was thought to have concealed assets from the administrator of the decedent's estate; when he failed to appear for his first scheduled deposition, the probate court held him in contempt, required a $ 10,000 bond to insure his appearance at the next deposition, and imposed a $ 100 a day fine for each day he failed to appear. The contemnor's appeal of that decision was still pending when he failed to show up for the next deposition. The probate court found him in contempt again, estreated the bond, and levied the fines. It was the second order of contempt that was before the court on review. The court held that it was not error to find the contemnor in contempt on a separate, unrelated offense while the appeal was still pending on the first contempt order because the first proceeding did not prevent the probate court from using its inherent power to punish new infractions. Second, the forfeiture of the bond and the fine were not unconstitutionally excessive because the dollar amount was dictated entirely by the contemnor's actions. Upon review of the record, the court found that the probate court did not abuse it discretion because of the contemnor's extreme misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the contemnor's assignments of error and affirmed the judgment of the probate court that held contemnor in contempt for failing to appear at a court ordered examination by the administrator of the decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board brought an action alleging that the children of a couple were dependents.

Both children were removed from the mother and placed in foster care. After removal, at her request, the board attempted reunification. The trial court found that the children were abused and granted temporary custody to the board. The board filed a motion for permanent custody, which the trial court granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in his breath. In connection with that, defendant was required to verify the existence of proof of financial responsibility covering the vehicle at the time of the alleged offense. The lower court suspended defendant's license for 90 days after he failed to provide proof of financial responsibility. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101 did not violate equal protection. On the contrary, there was a rational basis for imposing sanctions on drivers that did not comply with the financial responsibility requirements of &sect; 4509.101. It was reasonable to single out those accused of relatively serious traffic offenses to show proof of insurance given their demonstrated propensity to cause injury to other motorists. Moreover, the 90-day was not unduly harsh. Defendant was capable of finding other means of traveling to and from work. Based on the foregoing, defendant's assignments of error were overruled.</SPAN></P>

The student filed an action against defendants alleging misrepresentation, false advertising, and common law fraud. The court affirmed the trial court's award of summary judgment for defendants. The court held that the college was immune as a political subdivision under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02, and the student's argument that the statute was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds was without merit. Further, even assuming that the student proved all her allegations, there was no evidence of fraud on the part of defendants.

Marijuana that had been dropped was seized by the police. The lower court convicted defendant of selling marijuana in an amount less than the bulk amount, distributing marijuana, and possessing criminal tools. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that defendant was not entitled to suppress evidence of drugs seized because the police had a reasonable basis to suspect criminal activity, which justified their investigatory stop. In particular, the officers observed the car as the focal point of drug activity, observed an apparent sale of drugs, and discovered drugs in the area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trustee held 12 individual, taxable lots. Township enacted a zoning resolution that required a minimum lot size of five acres and provided that contiguous lots held by the same owner that did not meet the size requirement would be combined. The zoning board of appeals denied trustee's request for a variance as to her lots and trustee appealed the decision to the lower court. Such appeal was combined with trustee's declaratory judgment but then dismissed after the lower court rendered declaratory judgment in trustee's favor. The court held that the lower court's judgment was proper because the township failed to produce any evidence that there were corresponding public benefits that required that the zoning resolution be held valid despite its confiscatory nature. Secondly, trustee demonstrated a nonconforming use for the lots because the lots were platted and subdivided according to a planning scheme that took into effect the unique topographical features of the subdivision, and were improved with streets and certain utilities tailored to the individual lots. Finally, the effect of the combination of the lots into four larger lots would result in a substantial loss.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that the trial court correctly disposed of the issue relating to the &quot;exhaustion of remedies&quot; doctrine. Accordingly, the court could not consider the issue of constitutionality because the issue was not ripe for adjudication until an administrative hearing had been held and record established for review by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that appellant failed to commence his action within two years of decedent's death as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.02(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four years after the death of his mother, appellant, individually and as personal representative for his mother's estate, learned from a newspaper article that appellee pacemaker manufacturer had concealed defects in thousands of pacemakers. Determining that his mother's pacemaker was one of those recalled, appellant filed a wrongful death/survivorship action. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee and held that appellant failed to commence the action within the two-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.02(D). The court affirmed the judgment with respect to the wrongful death claim and held that the &quot;discovery rule&quot; did not apply to the wrongful death claim, a statutorily created right. Appellant's claim was barred by the two-year limitations period in &sect; 2125.02(D), which did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court reversed the judgment with respect to appellant's survivorship action. The court held that the discovery rule applied to this claim and that an issue of fact remained as to whether appellant's reading of the newspaper article triggered the two-year survivorship statute of limitations in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Municipal Court of Wayne County (Ohio), which convicted defendant, a railroad, on two charges of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5589.21, which prohibited obstruction of public roadways by railroad trains for more than five minutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5589.21 when its trains were observed blocking several roadways on two occasions for more than five minutes. Defendant claimed that &sect; 5589.21 was preempted by federal law that required defendant to perform certain safety checks when stopped for coupling and uncoupling procedures. The court rejected this argument because defendant did not show a physical impossibility of dual compliance. The court noted that defendant could have stopped its train elsewhere and thereby avoided blocking the roadways. Furthermore, there was no explicit preemption provision in the federal law. The court also rejected the argument that the state law was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the State's police power. The five minute time limit for blocking the roadways was a legislative choice that was suitably adopted and substantially related to achieving its purpose. The court also found that the State satisfied its burden of proof in the form of testimony by the deputy sheriff observing travelers being delayed or forced to find alternative routes. The State was not required to identify specific individuals who were inconvenienced.</SPAN></P>

P. 4(A)(1), the court conducted a probable cause hearing on the allegations. The court dismissed the affidavit of complainant, finding no probable cause for the offense alleged. The court determined that the actions of defendant were during the course of the plea bargaining process with complainant's client and, as such, defendant was immune from prosecution for coercion pursuant to &sect; 2905.12(B). The court concluded that defendant was free to attempt to secure a guilty plea by presenting complainant's client with a choice of either pleading guilty to one charge or facing prosecution on a more serious charge. The court found that such actions do not violate an accused's right to due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the court held that in determining whether a local ordinance conflicted with a state statute, the test was whether the ordinance permitted or licensed that which the statute forbade and prohibited, or vice versa.

The assertion that the regulation of the billboard was unconstitutional failed.

Code &sect; 1923.06, served notice of the eviction proceedings via regular United States mail and via service by a bailiff, who left a copy of the summons in defendant's mail slot. Trial court dismissed the complaint, noting that although plaintiff had complied with the requirements of &sect; 1923.06, she nonetheless had not properly served defendant, inasmuch as she failed to comply with the requirements of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, which require certified mail. Although &sect; 1923.06 purported to establish an exception to the Rules' certified mail requirement, that exception was unconstitutional, inasmuch as it was the prerogative of the state supreme court, and not the legislature, to establish rules of procedure. Since &sect; 1923.06 conflicted with the Rules, &sect; 1923.06 was deemed invalid. Accordingly, plaintiff's suit was dismissed for lack of effective service.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with four counts of both involuntary manslaughter and aggravated vehicular homicide, and one count of aggravated vehicular assault. The indictment also alleged defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol. He was treated at a hospital. A blood test done for medical purposes indicated he had a blood-alcohol level showing he was legally intoxicated. After the test was conducted, the sample was stored and then destroyed. Also, his counsel conducted an out-of-court experiment aimed at impeaching the blood-alcohol test results by showing the result that would be obtained if a similar individual drank approximately the way defendant did on the accident date. Defendant filed motions aimed at barring admission of the blood test results. The State moved to bar the out-of-court experiment evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A pledge brought suit against a fraternity based on alleged violations of a civil hazing statute. The court granted in part and denied in part the fraternity's motion to dismiss. The court reviewed the definition of hazing in the criminal statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.31, on which civil hazing claims were based and determined that the statute was not substantially overbroad. The statute sought to protect public health and safety by proscribing conduct rather than First Amendment expressions. Although the statute could implicate protected speech, the fraternity failed to prove that this was a substantial impact of the statute. More evidence was needed to determine whether certain offensive speech incidents were constitutionally protected. The phrase &quot;mental harm&quot; was too unclear to afford notice to persons of what was prohibited, but because &sect; 2903.31 was not vague in all of its applications, it was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. To the extent that the pledge sought recovery for any &quot;mental harm&quot; inflicted on him, the statute was unconstitutionally vague. He could thus only recover damages arising from physical harms sustained from acts of initiation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment brought against him for dereliction of duty and receiving improper compensation. He contended that the indictment was insufficient to charge criminal acts, that it did not charge that he had violated any express statutory duty, and that the claimed violation of Ohio. Adm. Code &sect; 4501-33-06 was insufficient to support a criminal indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been employed by the Ohio State Highway Patrol to inspect vehicles with salvage titles in order to recertify them under state law before issuing a new title. The Highway Patrol charged that he did not properly inspect the vehicles and gave preferential treatment to people who brought food to his office. The court granted defendant's motion because there were insufficient grounds to support either indictment. The court held that defendant's failure to perform the duties required of him under the state's administrative code was not a basis for criminal liability under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.44(E) because the administrative code did not set out the duties with such specificity that a person could be criminally liable for failure to perform them. The court found that the legislature did not intend for Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.43, which prohibited public servants from soliciting or receiving improper compensation to include such common social behavior as sharing food with others. The court held that the state's charges that defendant showed favoritism to people who brought food was too vague to be the basis of a criminal charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile, who was charged with armed robbery, moved the court for an order finding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26(B)(4)(b), the gun-specification portion of the mandatory waiver of juvenile court jurisdiction statute, unconstitutional based on a denial of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the level of the offense charged, aggravated burglary with a gun specification, and the age of the juvenile on the date of the offense, the juvenile court was required to set the matter for hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26(B) and Juv. R. Civ. P. 30, to determine whether probable cause existed to believe that the juvenile committed the acts alleged. If probable cause was found, the juvenile court had to waive jurisdiction and transfer the matter for prosecution as an adult. The testimony showed that the juvenile entered a home through an unlocked door and was then seen fleeing the residence carrying a Nintendo game, with a handgun tucked in the rear waistline of his pants. There was no evidence to suggest that he displayed, brandished, indicated possession of, or used the firearm to facilitate the offense. Thus the gun specification charge was not proved and the juvenile did not have to be transferred for trial as an adult. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26(B)(4)(b) required both that the child had a firearm on or about his person or under his control while committing the crime and that he somehow employed the firearm to facilitate its commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state failed to meet the elements of the gun specification of the juvenile's armed burglary charge and thus failed to prove probable cause as to the gun specification. Probable cause was found only as to aggravated burglary. The matter was not subject to mandatory transfer to the general division of the court of common pleas.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1533.71. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject of the controversy was a certain gray squirrel, which was apparently dislodged from its nest shortly after birth. It was discovered by defendant in this obviously imperiled state. She asked the Division whether she needed to get a license, and was told she did not. She cared for the squirrel, it lived, and nearly a year and a half passed, during which time the squirrel remained in the residence and became habituated to that environment. Enthralled with the creature, defendant carried it through a local parade and won first prize in the most unusual pet category, thereby garnering the attention of a wildlife officer, who charged her pursuant to &sect; 1533.71. She attempted to apply for a license and was denied. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charge. The court granted the motion because it found that the application of &sect; 1533.71 to this defendant was an arbitrary application of a licensing law for which the Division had no rules to determine who could qualify for a license. Discriminatory enforcement by officials given too much authority and too few constraints amounted to a due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the charge against defendant, and ordered that she be allowed to maintain possession of the squirrel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felonious assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11. Pursuant to the plea bargain agreement, the prosecuting attorney recommended that defendant's sentence be suspended and that defendant be placed on straight probation, community control, for a period of five years. The trial court did not find that the factors decreasing seriousness outweighed factors increasing seriousness to rebut the prison term under &sect; 2929.13(D). Defendant was sentenced to a five-year prison term. She filed a motion for judicial release after serving 180 days. The court granted the motion, ordered her to complete a corrections program, continue counseling, reimburse the clerk for cost of investigation and prosecution, and pay restitution if requested. Under &sect; 2929.12, defendant was a good candidate for judicial release. She had no prior felony convictions, the crime was a result of extreme emotional and mental stress, she was likely to respond favorable to community sanctions, the victim desired her release from prison, recidivism was not likely, she showed genuine remorse, and at the time of the offense, she was not on probation, parole, or community control.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a reinstatement suspension and with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OMVI), a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, a third offense. Defendant filed a motion in limine requesting an order to limit the use of his two previous OMVI convictions in the determination of a mandatory minimum sentence. Defendant claimed that the 1996 amendment to &sect; 4511.19 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the 1996 amendment to &sect; 4511.19, which increased the look-back period to six years for purposes of sentencing, affected a substantive right by providing a greater minimum penalty upon an OMVI offense for prior convictions. Accordingly, defendant asserted that the change in law was unconstitutional because the legislature was retroactively punishing an OMVI offender by taking into consideration convictions prior to the effective date of the amendment. Defendant's motion was denied. The court found that defendant was not punished by the amended law for his prior acts. The legislature did not change the law and therefore change the punishment for what had already occurred; instead, the legislature changed the law and thereby fully advised defendant of what the punishment was for a crime committed in the future. Defendant was informed of the full consequences before he allegedly committed the crime. The alleged violation occurred after the amendment, which fully advised the defendant of the consequences of future conduct. The court ruled that the amendment to &sect; 4511.19 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2743.60(E) for criminally injurious conduct toward the decedent. The claim was initially denied, but a panel of Commissioners reversed the denial. The court reversed the panel's order and denied the claim. Sub. H.B. 363, which was expressly retroactive and applied to the claim, prohibited the granting of an award of reparations if the victim or claimant was convicted of a felony or engaged in felonious conduct within 10 years prior to the criminally injurious conduct that was the basis of the claim. The decedent had been convicted of felonies within 10 years of the criminally injurious conduct. Thus, the applicant did not satisfy the burden of proving that the requirements for an award had been satisfied. Moreover, retrospective application of Sub. H.B. 363 was not unconstitutional. The general assembly clearly expressed its intention that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit challenging the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 6111.12(A)(3), which permitted the Director of Environmental Protection to allocate as much as 80 percent of a waterway's pollutant assimilative capacity to existing sources without antidegradation review, contending that the state legislation was preempted by federal law. Plaintiff and defendant each moved for summary judgment. In granting plaintiff's motion and denying that of defendant, the court concluded that the statute at issue conflicted with federal law and, therefore, violated the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution. If the state could permit degradation without public notice and hearing where a stream's use designation was not affected, it would render meaningless the comprehensive nature of the Federal Clean Water Act and its purposes in relation to both water pollution control efforts and public participation requirement. Because the statute failed to comport with federal notice and hearing requirements, it was declared invalid, and defendant was enjoined from taking any action pursuant to the invalid enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was granted and defendant's summary judgment motion was denied, as federal law preempted the field.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violation of the Access to Firearms Ordinance after he placed a handgun in the cushion of the couch at his home where the four-year-old victim came upon the gun and discharged it, causing her death. Defendant moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that the ordinance was void for vagueness. The court denied the motion, holding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The language of the ordinance was clear and unambiguous, and the average person reading the ordinance would have had little doubt about its meaning. Moreover, since the ordinance on its face did not encourage inconsistent enforcement or grant unfettered discretion to law enforcement personnel to define the prohibited conduct, the ordinance provided constitutionally sufficient standards for those charged with enforcing the ordinance. Furthermore, whether or not any constitutional protection was implicated in this ordinance, including but not limited to the Second Amendment right to bear arms, the ordinance clearly bears a real and substantial relation to the health, safety, and general welfare of the public and was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners argued that there was a nearly rebuttable presumption that annexation served the general good of the territory because all of the property owners had petitioned for annexation. The court held that respondent's order would be overturned only if its decision was unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The determination of whether the proposed annexation would serve the general good of the territory was a factual determination within respondent's discretion. The court found that the evidence presented on the territories' financial stability, taxes, and ability to provide adequate police, fire, waste collection, road maintenance, and land use and planning was conflicting, at best, but supported the decision.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted for involuntary manslaughter under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04(B). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which the court granted. The court found that defendant carried his burden of showing that the statutory scheme created an unconstitutional classification, that the classification of motor vehicle operator, unlike classifications based on race or gender, was not a &quot;suspect class,&quot; and that the operation a motor vehicle was a privilege, not a &quot;fundamental right.&quot; The court found that, instead of requiring the state to have proved an additional element for the elevated crime of involuntary manslaughter, the statute eliminated one of the elements required to establish the lesser offense of vehicular homicide. The court held that to have proved involuntary manslaughter all the state had to prove was the violation of a minor misdemeanor traffic rule, which was by law a lapse of due care, but to have proved vehicular homicide the state must have also proved that such a violation constituted a &quot;substantial&quot; lack of due care, i.e., substantial negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state claimed that &sect; 2919.25(A) provided protection to persons who were cohabiting regardless of their sex. Defendant claimed that the civil domestic violence statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3113.31, did not apply to persons of the same gender. The court held that defendant was guilty of domestic violence. The court found that the statutory definitions did not require the person to be a spouse but merely to function like a spouse and that, because cohabiting was not defined in the statutes, it had to be read in context and according to common usage. The ordinary meaning of cohabitation was the act of living together and what constituted living together was a question of fact in each case. The meaning of cohabiting stressed the importance of living together and discounted the parties' legal status and sexual relations as being the determinative consideration. If the legislature had intended to limit the application of the statutes to people of opposite sexes, it would have made specific reference to gender. The evidence satisfied all the factors indicative of cohabitation and the victim had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she was a person cohabiting with defendant.</SPAN></P>

After defendant's right to drive was suspended, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(D)(1) was ruled a nullity, as unconstitutional, to the extent that it mandated an instant license suspension. Defendant argued that his suspension was unconstitutional based on that ruling. The court found that the finding that &sect; 4511.191(D)(1) was unconstitutional to the extent that it mandated instant suspension did not apply retroactively because the decision was one of first impression that was not clearly foreshadowed, retrospective application would retard the operation of &sect; 4511.191(D)(1), and retroactive application would produce substantial inequitable results.

Thereafter, defendant paid a reinstatement fee as required by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Defendant sought dismissal of the drunk-driving charges on the grounds that they subjected him to the possibility of successive punishments in violation of double jeopardy protections. The court, in dismissing the charges, agreed in part. The court determined that the ALS did not bar the criminal proceeding because such suspensions were not punishments but were merely administrative and remedial consequences, authorized by the State for the protection of its drivers.

Defendants alleged that the Administrative License Suspension law of Ohio (ALS) constituted a penalty or punishment within the context of the double jeopardy clause. The court held that if the ALS was merely a remedial sanction, the double jeopardy clause did not apply because there was no prior penalty. If, in fact, it was a penalty, it penalized conduct separate from that sought to be punished in the subsequent operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OMVI) prosecution. Again the double jeopardy clause did not apply. In either case, the double jeopardy clause was not a defense to an OMVI prosecution based solely upon prior imposition of an ALS which resulted from refusal to consent to a chemical test.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the administrative suspension of his license followed by the prosecution of the criminal acts subjected him to the possibility of successive punishment in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court disagreed. The immediate suspension of defendant's driving privilege did not constitute a punishment, which triggered a double jeopardy impediment to any further governmental enforcement action. The suspension of the driver's licenses was remedial in nature and not punishment, such that defendant's double jeopardy argument in that regard was unavailing and had to fail. The State had a paramount interest in promoting public safety by removing drunk drivers from the highways. Hence, the purpose of the suspension was to protect the public and not to punish defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court next considered whether the actions of the officer met the requisite standard under Ohio law to initiate a stop. The officer testified that he observed the vehicle after the hour of curfew and in an area from where the police had received complaints about curfew violations. The officer also testified that he observed three &quot;young looking persons&quot; in the automobile. Under the circumstances, the officer had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that defendant and the other occupants were violating the curfew law.

In 1994, the employer, which was self-insured, sought to intervene therein, claiming that it was entitled to be subrogated to the worker's claim to the extent that the employer had paid workers' compensation benefits to the worker on account thereof. The court denied intervention to the employer because Ohio Rev.

It found that any reading of the statute that would afford it retroactivity would also render the statute unconstitutional because it then would violate prohibitions in Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the charge on the grounds that recent amendments to the state's DUI statutes had rendered the statutes unconstitutional. Defendant also moved to suppress evidence. By agreement of the parties, the motion to suppress was not addressed pending disposition of the motion to dismiss. Defendant argued that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511 were disproportionately punitive in imposing mandatory incarceration for a misdemeanor and were ex post facto provisions that allowed retrospective use of prior convictions. Defendant also argued that the provisions for license suspension and vehicle forfeiture without a hearing were unconstitutional takings in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the state and federal constitutions and in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court agreed that the sentencing and forfeiture provision of the statutes were clearly unconstitutional and clearly violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court denied the motion to dismiss, however, because the legislation was unconstitutional and had thus failed to repeal or amend the prior legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boards adopted two separate identical resolutions, entitled &quot;Non-Smoking Policy Regulation,&quot; which dealt with smoking in enclosed areas where the public was invited. The business owners and the trade associations filed a complaint against the boards, which sought a declaratory judgment pronouncing the regulations invalid and injunctive relief permanently enjoining the implementation of the regulations. After a preliminary hearing, the court concluded (1) the power to regulate smoking was contained within the statutory powers granted the boards in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3709.20 and 3709.21; (2) the boards' regulations were not in conflict with state law, nor were they preempted by the smoking regulations enacted in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3791.031; (3) the regulations represented an usurpation of legislative power because the regulations constituted prohibited lawmaking rather than permitted rulemaking, and (4) it was not permitted to edit and to carve out the invalid portions of the resolutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169, defendant Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles suspended the driving privileges of plaintiff driver for six months following his Indiana conviction for driving under the influence (DUI). The suspension was confirmed on administrative appeal. The driver then brought an action seeking to have &sect; 4507.169 declared unconstitutional, alleging that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver sought a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 was unconstitutional, arguing that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause because Ohio licensees who received out-of-state DUI convictions were not entitled to petition for conditional driving privileges, as were licensees receiving in-state convictions. The Bureau moved to dismiss, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction, that the issue was moot because the driver's suspension had expired, and that &sect; 4507.169 was constitutional because the Driver License Compact (DLC), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.60, mandated that licensees with out of state convictions be treated as if the conviction occurred in-state. Upon consideration, the court found &sect; 4507.169 constitutional. The court overruled the motion to dismiss, finding that the action met the court's jurisdictional requirements and fell within the public rights exception to the mootness doctrine. The court found that &sect; 4507.169, when read in pari materia with the DCL, permitted licensees with out of state convictions to petition for conditional privileges in the same manner as licensees with in-state convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a statute that denied Ohio licensees with out of state DUI convictions the right to petition for conditional driving privileges did not violate equal protection because when read in conjunction with the Driver License Compact the statute permitted such licensees to petition for such privileges and that the proper court for such a petition was the municipal or county court in the jurisdiction where the petitioner resided.</SPAN></P>

ODMRDD alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.01(L) (1993), by becoming effective during the proceedings, prevented the institutionalization of anyone under age 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a temporary order of institutionalization before the effective date of Ohio Rev.

The court denied summary judgment to ODMRDD, reasoning that the statute could not be applied retroactively to prevent the minor's institutionalization by court order. No retroactivity clause was contained in the statute. In addition, the statute violated equal protection because it afforded the &quot;remedy&quot; of institutionalization only to those mentally retarded persons who were over age 18.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 2925.03(M) was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power, violating defendant's right of due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He further contended that the mandated suspension violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed with defendant's Eighth Amendment challenge because the court failed to see how the loss of driving privileges for a period of time could have been so &quot;shocking&quot; to the community's sense of justice as to render the punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment. However, the court found merit in defendant's due process argument. The court determined that in applying the rational relationship test, that the means chosen by the legislature, license suspension, did not bear a reasonable relationship to &sect; 2925.03(M)'s purpose of providing for the safe and legal operation and ownership of motor vehicles. The court held that a significant factor in its holding declaring &sect; 2925.03(M)&nbsp;unconstitutional, was that the statute did not require the use of a car in the commission of the drug trafficking offense as a prerequisite for the suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a biological mother of a child conceived by artificial insemination, moved to dismiss a suit filed by plaintiff, the donor of the sperm used in the child's artificial insemination, to determine paternity, custody, support, and visitation with the child. The mother sought to dismiss the suit, claiming that the donor had no rights with respect to the child under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.30 and therefore had failed to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Though the mother and the donor agreed prior to her insemination that the donor would be the child's &quot;male role model,&quot; the mother allegedly refused to actually allow him to play any such role. When the donor sued to determine paternity, custody, support, and visitation, the mother argued that the claim was barred by &sect; 3111.37(B). The court denied her motion to dismiss, and it declared that the donor had established a parental relationship with the child. Noting that Ohio's artificial insemination law was intended to afford anonymity only to such persons as complied with requirements set out in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3111.32, 3111.33(B), and 3111.35. the court held that the mother was not entitled to take advantage of the protection from the donor's claims afforded in &sect; 3111.37(B) because she had bypassed the medical requirements. Moreover, &sect; 3111.37(B) did not prevent a paternity adjudication where, as here, an unmarried woman solicited the donor's participation and the donor and woman had agreed to the donor's future relationship with the child. Moreover, if the law was construed to prevent that adjudication, it was unconstitutional as applied to the donor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the donor had established a parental relationship with the child and it overruled the mother's motion to dismiss. The court ordered home investigations of both the donor and the mother as well as psychological examinations of the two adult parties as well as their partners.</SPAN></P>

Defendants brought a motion to dismiss the indictment, alleging that the local ordinance under which they were charged was unconstitutionally vague. The court ruled that all legislative enactments enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality. Further, the court held that courts must apply all presumptions and pertinent rules of construction so as to uphold, if at all possible, a statute or ordinance assailed as unconstitutional. Also, the court found that the constitutional requirement of definiteness was violated by a criminal statute that failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute. The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that persons of ordinary intelligence could comprehend that the local ordinance under which they were charged prohibited them from selling or displaying merchandise within 20 feet of a crosswalk, and therefore the ordinance was not so vague as to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was granted a use variance, with conditions attached, that allowed him to dry nets used in his commercial fishing operation on his land that was located in an area that was zoned residential.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case came before the court on the motion of defendants, a mother and her husband, to dismiss a paternity action brought by plaintiff, the putative biological father, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.04(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative biological father brought an action to determine paternity between himself and the 17 month-old son of defendants. The father alleged that the mother gave birth to the child after she slept with him, and he asserted his right to a determination of the child's paternity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.04(A). The mother's husband was presumed under &sect; 3111.03(A)(1) to be the natural father of the child born during his marriage, and, as he and his wife were married and intended to raise the child as their son, defendants moved to dismiss. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.04(A) was an unconstitutional infringement on the family's fundamental right to marital privacy and on their freedom to raise their child without a state-authorized intrusion. In addition, the statute was overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An applicant for an award of reparations under the Victims of Crime Act appealed a decision of a single commissioner of the court denying the claim. The single commissioner held that the September 1986 reparations application was not timely filed. The applicant contended that the one-year statute of limitations should have been tolled in equity after the August 1985 criminally injurious conduct because he was psychologically unfit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was mentally incompetent from August 1985 until at least 1989. The Attorney General argued that the denial should be affirmed because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2743.56(C)(2) and 2743.60(A) stated that a reparations application must have been filed within one year after the date of the criminally injurious conduct. The single commissioner applied the two sections without considering the applicant's mental condition at any time. The panel, however, considered mental competency a dispositive factor. It ruled that the two sections were tolled by reason of the applicant's mental incompetency; thus, the application complied with the one-year filing requirement. The panel noted a 1991 decision of the court holding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.56(C)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to minors. Although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 was inapplicable to the limitations provisions of the Act, the panel also noted that the 1991 decision mentioned &sect; 2305.16 peripherally as &quot;in effect&quot; controlling on the duration of the tolling period. The panel found this reference significant because &sect; 2305.16 provided for a tolling period applicable to minors, as well as to persons of unsound mind.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three-commissioner panel reversed the decision of the single commissioner. Because the applicant's economic loss was not determinable from the claim file, the claim was to be remanded to the single commissioner and referred back to the Attorney General for calculation of the applicant's economic loss.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1545.99, which provided only fines as penalties for violations of park rules. The court further held that the phrase &quot;unnatural sex act&quot; in Rule 4.2 was unconstitutionally vague because it did not advise people in advance of the nature of a violation and that Rule 4.2 was unconstitutionally overbroad because it proscribed more than fighting words. The court also held that the complaint failed to state a violation of Rule 4.2 because it alleged that defendant solicited &quot;sexual conduct,&quot; which phrase was not contained in Rule 4.2.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's actions did not constitute a violation of &sect; 2917.31 because &sect; 2917.31(A)(2) and (3) specifically required that the accused threaten to commit an offense of violence or commit an offense with reckless disregard that the commission of the offense would cause serious inconvenience or harm, and defendant's companions, including the individual who was the potential victim, testified that they knew defendant had a cap pistol and that they were not in fear of their own safety and there was no evidence the general public was inconvenienced or alarmed by defendant's actions.

The hotel sought to remove the action to the Lima Municipal Court, alleging that the Marion Municipal Court was an improper venue for the action. In dismissing the action, the court held that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.19(A)(4) existed as a geographic limitation on the subject-matter jurisdiction of municipal courts, and did not relate to venue. The subject matter of the action, an alleged breach of contract entered into in Allen County, Ohio, for entertainment services to be rendered in Allen County, Ohio, was not located within the territorial limits of the court. The hotel did not reside in the court's territory, and was not served with summons within the court's territory. The territorial jurisdiction requirements of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an abortion clinic, doctors, and others, sought an injunction and declaratory relief from Ohio H.B. 108, that defendant governor signed into law. The plaintiffs claimed that H.B. 108 which regulated various pre-abortion activities violated their rights to liberty, freedom of conscience and of speech, privacy to make reproductive decisions, and equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In analyzing the plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the H.B. 108, it adopted their view that the Ohio Constitution provided greater protection then the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the court found that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1 (1851), the liberty and privacy guarantees, and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1851), the free speech guarantee, were more sweeping then their federal counterparts based upon their textual differences. Consequently, the Ohio Constitution contained an implied right of privacy that afforded protection for reproductive freedom, and therefore H.B. 108 was unconstitutional on its face. Similarly, H.B. 108 violated the freedom of conscience provision guaranteed by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because it interfered with deeply-held moral and philosophical conviction of women regarding the direction of their lives as impacted by the prospect of having an abortion. The statute also deprived women of equal protection under the law, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, because it burdened women's reproductive choices while not similarly burdening the reproductive choices of men.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute regulating various pre-abortion activities violated both federal and state constitutions, and it then issued an injunction enjoining its taking effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Ohio Rev.

The State did not oppose the motion on the ground that the resolution was in excess of statutory authority. The court held that although the parties agreed that the resolution in question exceeded the authority of the board of commissioners, it was required to independently examine the issues presented. The resolution at issue specified that it had authority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 4511.07(I). The court agreed that the resolution was improper because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.07 was a general statute allowing local authorities to enact local traffic regulations. However, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5577.08 was a special statutory provision establishing the authority of a board of commissioners to specify the maximum load allowable on county and township roads.

Defendant was arrested for driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated. His blood alcohol content was .159. The court found in favor of defendant, concluding that he was not guilty of child endangerment in violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2919.22(A). That statute prohibited a person from creating a substantial risk of injury to a child that he or she had custody of. Substantial risk was defined as a strong possibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with failing to provide adequate support for his children in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The State of Ohio filed a motion to include as an element of the offense the failure to support for a period of 26 weeks out of consecutive 104 weeks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because &quot;adequate support&quot; was not defined, &sect; 2919.21 was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. He also argued that there would have to be a prior conviction or a prior court finding for the charge to be enhanced from a misdemeanor of the first degree to a felony of the fourth degree. The court rejected defendant's first argument but agreed with his second argument. First, the court recognized that the word &quot;adequate&quot; standing alone necessarily created a degree of uncertainty. However, the court found that &sect; 2919.21 was not so indefinite and uncertain as to rise to a level of unconstitutionality. A person of ordinary common intelligence should be able to comprehend the meaning of &quot;adequate support&quot; and recognize when he or she would be in violation of &sect; 2919.21. Second, the court considered the legislative history and concluded that absent a showing of a prior conviction or a prior specific court finding in a different court concerning defendant not providing adequate support, the court would treat the case as a misdemeanor. Courts had to assume that the legislature did not intend to do a vain act by incorporating language in a statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss but sustained his position that absent a previous finding of defendant's failure to support, the offense in the indictment as alleged was a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court overruled the State's motion to include as an element of the offense failure to support for a period of 26 weeks out of a consecutive 104 weeks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners claimed that the rezoning of the adjacent landowner's property was procedurally invalid because the commission failed to issue a recommendation as required by Ohio Rev.

The commission countered that the &sect; 303.12(E) recommendation was not a mandatory requirement and that the court should treat the failure to act as a recommendation of approval. The court granted the landowners' requested declaratory judgment. The court refused to invalidate the zoning amendment on the grounds that the adjacent landowner failed to submit a development plan or that it constituted spot zoning. Despite the lack of detail, the court held that the landowner's exhibit 1 qualified as a development plan. The court further held that there was no showing of spot zoning. However, the court held that the provisions of &sect; 303.12(E) requiring action on the part of the planning commission were mandatory in spite of the fact that the planning commission's role was purely ministerial in nature.

Code &sect; 742.63, which dealt with the Firemen's and Policemen's Death Benefits Fund, be declared unconstitutional. Both the spouse and defendants filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouse complained in her declaratory judgment action that statutes that dealt with the Fund were unconstitutional. The spouse claimed that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 742.63 denied equal protection by providing different benefits to persons who were similarly situated, that it was not a uniform application of law, and that she was denied due process. Specifically, the spouse contended that &sect; 742.63 allowed the spouse of a deceased fireman who was not survived by children to receive more benefits than the spouse of a deceased fireman who was survived by children. Both the spouse and defendants moved for summary judgment. The court denied defendants' motion and granted the spouse's motion. The court held that the statute violated the spouse's right to equal protection under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and the Fourteenth Amendment because there was no rational basis for the legislature's classification of similarly situated persons. The court rejected the spouse uniform application and due process arguments. The court ordered the Fund to reallocate the spouse's benefits and pay her the benefits under &sect; 742.63(B) for a surviving spouse of a fireman not survived by children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court concerned whether the panel's decision to deny reimbursement for the mother's own counseling was reasonable and lawful. The court noted that the mother was neither spatially nor temporally proximate to the criminal incident, but found no authority which mandated strict adherence in Ohio tort law to extreme emotional distress in all cases. Recognizing the unique circumstances which arose when a child was sexually abused, the court deemed it wise to take these circumstances into account when determining whether the parent of a sexually abused child was a victim in her own right. The court determined that by the very nature of the offense, learning that a child had been sexually assaulted was distressful for the child's parents, because the parents often felt that they were responsible for not protecting the child from such danger. The court found the mother to be a victim in her own right and that she suffered a great deal of emotional distress and anxiety due to her direct awareness that her daughter had been assaulted. The court concluded that the mother was entitled to reparations for her psychological counseling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the panel's decision and remanded the matter to the panel for determination of the amount to which the mother was entitled commensurate with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

A three-commissioner panel held that the statute of limitations under the Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.56(C)(1), was unconstitutional and reversed the single commissioner's decision denying the claim. The Ohio Attorney General filed a notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.56(C)(1) was unconstitutional as applied to minors and the decision of the panel of commissioners was reasonable and lawful. The court held that it was unreasonable and patently arbitrary to foreclose minors the opportunity to bring a claim for compensation through the Crime Victims Compensation Act. The court found that the minor had no standing to bring a crime victims application on her own behalf, and the appointment of a guardian or relying on the parent to bring the application was not a viable alternative. The appointment of a guardian would not cure the defect because it had been held in most jurisdictions that the appointment of a guardian did not cause the statute of limitations to begin running against the minor. In addition, the parents might not always timely bring the action on behalf of the minor. If a parent or guardian did not protect the minor's interest, the minor could be foreclosed from filing what could be a legitimate claim for reparations. This foreclosure violated the due course, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and open court provisions, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

The officer testified that during the second verbal encounter defendant obviously had an erection of his penis and was masturbating himself. Regarding the charge of importuning under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found in contempt by the Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, Butler County (Ohio), under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3113.31 and received a suspended sentence of 30 days in jail for violating a protection order based on acts he committed at his wife's place of employment. Charges were also brought against him in the court for a criminal violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2919.27. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant based his motion on the Double Jeopardy Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The question presented was whether the finding of contempt under &sect; 3113.31 would bar the State from prosecuting defendant under &sect; 2919.27. In dismissing, the court held that &sect; 3113.31(L)(2) was unconstitutional on its face. While the legislature had attempted to remedy the double jeopardy problem with &sect; 3113.31(L)(2), which allowed credit for any time served on one case to be applied against the other, it did not avoid the constitutional prohibition against multiple prosecutions. The legislature had enacted a statute declaring that previous contempt holdings would not be a bar to subsequent prosecutions for violation of &sect; 2919.27. However, the legislature could not, by mere statutory enactment, abrogate the federal and state constitutional provisions against double jeopardy. The court concluded that there was no doubt that the exact same evidence would be used by the prosecution in the case as was used in the contempt proceeding and that the conduct of defendant would be the identical conduct. Accordingly, the prosecution was estopped from pursuing the charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a conviction from the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), in which he entered a no contest plea to a charge of importuning in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(B) after he solicited a male undercover officer to engage in oral sex, contending the statute was constitutionally violative of equal protection and that prosecutors failed to meet their burden of proof under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant saw two men by a road in a park and drove over to speak to them. He asked one man, who was an undercover officer, to engage in oral sex. Defendant entered a no contest plea to a charge of importuning in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(B) prohibiting the solicitation of a same sex person to engage in sexual activity when the offender knew it was offensive to the other person. Defendant argued that the statute violated the equal protection clause by making such activity unlawful for homosexuals, but not heterosexuals and that the state failed to meet its burden of proof. On appeal, the court discharged defendant, finding that it did not need to reach the issue of whether homosexuals were a suspect class, because the state failed to meet its burden of proof. For defendant to be convicted of importuning, his solicitation had to rise to the level of inciting an immediate breach of the peace. Defendant made no physical contact and there were no fighting words: profane, offensive language was protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I. Conviction for importuning had to be based on solicitation beyond conversation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court order of conviction for importuning was reversed and defendant discharged because his invitation to engage in homosexual sex did not rise to fighting words, as the First Amendment required that a conviction for a solicitation rose to a level of inciting an immediate breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

Petition was signed by seven of the 12 property owners in the parcel to be annexed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioners found that the petition complied with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033(A), (B), (C), and (D), but denied the petition due to its finding that the annexation petition was unreasonably large in that owners of approximately 59 percent of the land sought to be annexed either did not sign or withdrew their names from the petition. The court held that the percentage of property owned by petition signers had no relevance to the question of whether the property was unreasonably large under &sect; 709.033(D). The physical size of the territory to be annexed in relation to the current area of the township was small. The administrative hearing, only one resident testified against the annexation, while all other property owners were in support of it. There was no evidence to support the Commissioners' finding that the irregular borders dividing the parcel and the township would not serve the &quot;general good of the territory sought to be annexed.&quot; Because the court found no substantial, reliable, or probative evidence to support the Commissioners' determination, the area should be annexed as described in the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Commissioners' resolution and ordered that the territory sought to be annexed, should be annexed to the city.</SPAN></P>

The phone system was installed, and payments were being made. The state determined that the contract had been entered into without the required competitive bidding. All payments to the company were stopped. The state sought a relief of payment. The company's counterclaim asserted that the agreements were valid leases, and the state breached their contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the facts and law indicated that the agreements at issue were leases and, in the eyes of the law, they were valid and enforceable between the parties. The court articulated that the decision to stop payment, even if made upon the advice of the state's Attorney General's Office, constituted a breach of that contract. Accordingly, the court opined that the state was liable to the company for all payments owed plus interest at the indicated rate. Additionally, the court found that the phones were and remained the company's property. The court held that because the state breached the lease agreement, the company could elect any of the contractual remedies, including the repossession of its property from every location wherever situated. Or the parties could, if the company agreed, continue under the terms of the leases, there having been considerable testimony that the state Auditor's Office was completely satisfied with both the equipment and service up to the time of breach. The court found the company's counterclaim moot. The court articulated that it would entertain a post-trial brief on reasonable attorney's fees for the company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found in favor of the company by holding the state fully liable for stopping payment on the phone installation contract with the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor filed a complaint pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.85(A)(4)(a), requesting the issuance of an order authorizing her to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without the notification of her parents, based on the allegation that she was sufficiently mature and well enough informed to intelligently decide whether to have an abortion without the notification of her parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.85(D) authorized juvenile courts to permit a minor female to consent to an abortion without parental notification. To that end, Ohio Superintendence R. 76(H) provided that the juvenile court was not to notify the juvenile's parents of a minor female's complaint. However, such notice provisions were in direct contradiction to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.35(C) and Ohio R. Juv. P. 15(A), which required parental notification in all juvenile court proceedings. Because Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B) provided that procedural rules took precedence over procedural statutes, regardless of the time of enactment, Ohio R. Juv. P. 15(A) took precedence over the notice provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.85(D). In turn, the court stated that the juvenile rules took precedence over the superintendence rules. Because parental notification would undermine the purpose of the statute, the court declared that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.85(D), in its entirety, was without force or effect. Also declared unconstitutional was Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.12(B)(1), which prohibited any person from knowingly performing or inducing an abortion upon an unemancipated minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual was injured through the acts of a corporation, and received a jury award for past and future compensatory damages.

Code &sect; 2317.45 would violate the right to substantive due process. The court further held that such a setoff violated the right to a jury trial, the right to an open court and a fair and impartial remedy, and the right to equal protection under the law, and that &sect; 2317.45 was therefore unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected motions to dismiss the indictments because it found that they conformed to Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(B). The court also found that there was no showing that the grand jury instructions were improper, or that they did not require an independent determination of probable cause. Because this was the first attempt in Ohio and the United States to prosecute an art museum for obscenity, defendants also sought to dismiss the indictments as based on selective prosecution. The court found that defendant art center was a gallery and not a museum, defendants were not denied the right to display the challenged photographs, and defendants knew that certain photographs in the exhibit provided probable cause for prosecution. The court further held that there was no evidence of unconstitutional activities in the enforcement of these laws against these defendants. The court rejected defendants' motions that challenged the search warrant because probable cause existed to issue the warrant. The court also rejected the challenges to the constitutionality of the statutes and the characterization of the exhibit as obscene because these issues were for determination at trial.</SPAN></P>
