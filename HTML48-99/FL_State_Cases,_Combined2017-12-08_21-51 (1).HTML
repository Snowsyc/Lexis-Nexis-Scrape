Appellant placed a telephone call from Florida to a Michigan resident, during which appellant made various false misrepresentations concerning real estate located in Florida, with the intent of soliciting a sale of the real estate to the Michigan complainant, which exposed appellant to criminal liability in Michigan. Appellant contended that it was unconstitutional to permit extradition of persons who were never physically present in the demanding state. The court affirmed and determined that having been charged with a crime under the laws of Michigan, appellant was not entitled to have the court construe Michigan's laws. The court concluded that appellant was sufficiently charged with a violation of Michigan law to entitle the state to extradite him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, club owner and operator, filed an action for malicious prosecution and other related causes of action against appellees, the city of Cape Canaveral and its chief of police, resulting from a series of arrests and prosecutions of appellants. At trial, a directed verdict was granted in favor of appellees on all counts. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on all counts except for the malicious prosecution action against appellee city of Cape Canaveral. The court concluded that law enforcement is typically the task of the executive, and thus does not fall within the area of municipal tort immunity reserved for judicial, quasi-judicial, legislative, and quasi-legislative functions. Rather, the conduct of which appellants complained fell into the category of governmental functions for which a municipality can be liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior if the tort is committed against one with whom the municipality employee is in privity, or is otherwise in contact in a direct transaction or confrontation. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court as to the count for malicious prosecution and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The judgment of the trial court granting directed verdicts for appellee chief of police was affirmed on all counts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the single family zoning imposed on appellant's property. The trial court upheld the zoning field, and appellant challenged. The court held that the fact that most of the land located in appellee town was committed to multi-family use did not prevent appellee from adopting and enforcing single family zoning regulations. Although the highest and best use for appellant's property was multi-family, the constitutional validity of the zoning was not based upon the highest and best use. Rather, in order for the zoning to have been held unconstitutional, the ordinance must have deprived appellant of the beneficial use of the property by precluding all potential uses of the property. In addition, the zoning did not affirmatively appear arbitrary and unreasonable and without substantial relation to the public safety, health, morals, or general welfare. Finally, the court held that appellee did not have the burden of demonstrating a real, material, and substantial public need for the single family zoning. Rather, appellant had the burden of proving it was invalid. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment upholding the single family zoning imposed on appellant corporation's property because protecting single family developments was a legitimate objective of zoning and zoning was the exclusive function of appellee town, not the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the trial court, which involuntarily hospitalized him on the ground that he was mentally ill. Appellant presented two points on the appeal. The first point urged that Fla.

The second point urged that the trial court erred in failing to apply the beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof in the involuntary hospitalization hearing. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court because the constitutional issue was determined in another proceeding, and the trial court properly applied the clear and convincing evidence standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school board sought review of an order of respondent Public Employees Relations Commission (Florida), which found that petitioner had committed an unfair labor practice in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 447.501(1)(a) and (c) by refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with respondent teachers union.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed that petitioner school board had refused to bargain collectively in good faith when it asserted throughout the negotiations that certain mandatory subjects of bargaining were not negotiable, when it released to the press a salary proposal that had never been presented to respondent teachers union during bargaining, and when it asserted that the impasse, caused by the union, had cost the teachers their raise. The court rejected the contention that the determinative issue was whether non-negotiable issues were subject to mandatory bargaining, explaining the alleged unfair labor practice was the refusal to bargain in good faith by engaging in surface bargaining. Here, substantial evidence supported the finding that petitioner's conduct throughout the course of negotiations demonstrated a lack of good faith. In support, the court pointed to a memorandum by petitioner's chief negotiator written prior to negotiations on how to frustrate respondent's chief negotiator and undercut teacher loyalty to him. Moreover, respondent Public Employees Relations Commission possessed authority under Fla. Stat. ch. 447.503(4)(a) (1975) to order petitioner to bargain in good faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed finding that petitioner school board had committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with respondent teachers union, because substantial evidence supported a finding that petitioner engaged only in surface bargaining and that petitioner had attempted to disrupt negotiating process by frustrating respondent union's chief negotiator and undercutting teacher loyalty to respondent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an action for declaratory judgment to determine whether it was liable both for the payment of a severance oil and gas tax and a tangible personal property tax. The trial court granted summary judgment in appellee's favor. The court affirmed. There was no impediment in a county assessing an ad valorem personal property tax on oil and gas producing equipment in addition to a severance tax. Fla. Stat. ch. 211.13 (1967) previously prohibited ad valorem taxes from being imposed on equipment where severance tax was already being paid. However, Fla. Stat. ch. 211.13 (1972) amended that portion of the statute. Thus, there was no longer a legislative intent by which a court could validly determine a set-off should have been made against the severance tax for any ad valorem taxes due on equipment. Accordingly, the court affirmed the order granting appellee summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to conspiracy, attempted kidnapping, attempted robbery, and resisting arrest with violence. On appeal, appellant only challenged his convictions for conspiracy and attempted kidnapping. The court affirmed appellant's convictions holding first that the issue of the constitutionality of Fla.

The court noted the trial court's record did not reflect that a motion to dismiss the information for attempted kidnapping was made, that a claim of unconstitutionality was presented or ruled on besides a motion for judgment of acquittal. Second, the court ruled that the evidence supported appellant's conspiracy conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant asserted that appellee prisoner lacked standing pursuant to Florida Administrative Procedure Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 120.56 (Supp. 1976).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment that found Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-3.08(2) to be invalid. Rule 33-3.08 set forth the procedures by which a prison inmate was subjected to disciplinary confinement and forfeiture of gain-time. Appellee prisoner had been found guilty of an offense and served disciplinary confinement. The court agreed with appellant Department of Offender Rehabilitation that appellee did not have standing to challenge the rule. The court examined the legislative history of the standing provisions of the Florida Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Fla. Stat. ch. 120.56 (Supp. 1976), and drew comparisons with the federal APA, 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 702. The court concluded that a party must show a substantial, not illusory, interest. The court held that appellee failed to establish an injury in fact which was accompanied by a continuing, present effect. Appellee had completed his disciplinary confinement and had not lost any gain-time. The court also found that appellee did not have standing merely as a member of the prison class when, although he had suffered a past injury, future injury depended on the possibility of future infractions, which was a matter of speculation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's actions and held that the trial court had authority to issue the restraining order without a prior viewing based upon the sworn complaint that described the allegedly obscene material. The court held that the trial court's scheduled hearing satisfied the constitutional requirement that a judicial officer make a judicial determination of obscenity before any seizure of the alleged obscene material took place.</SPAN></P>

The court held that no error was demonstrated with regard to the entry of the order authorizing the deposit because ch. 711.63(4) required unit owners initiating any type of action to deposit such rents collected into the registry of court during the pendency of litigation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the owners of a number of partially submerged lots, sought judicial review of a decision from respondent Department of Environmental Regulation, which denied petitioners' application for a permit to fill their lots. Petitioners asserted that respondent was not authorized to review a county commission's findings, and that Fla. Stat. ch. 253.124 did not contain adequate standards to guide respondent's discretion in determining whether to grant or deny the permit. The court denied the petition, holding that respondent was authorized to review all considerations for which the county commissioners had primary review. The court also held that there was an array of procedural safeguards which lessened the need for strict statutory standards in the delegation of power to administrative agencies. Thus, the legislature recognized that determination of each application for a fill permit involved complicated decisions which could not intelligently be guided by specific or quantitative statutory standards. The legislature chose therefore to direct respondent's attention to several areas of inquiry in the exercise of its sound and reviewable discretion to grant or deny permits.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court dismissed the complaint and held the circuit court of appeal had subject matter jurisdiction over agency regulations. The court reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the circuit court and held that the circuit court had jurisdiction. The court found that the regulation at issue was not a final agency action when appellants' complaint was filed because the regulation was not yet effective. The court stated that, until the time a regulation becomes effective, it is only a proposed rule subject to withdrawal or modification by the agency. The court observed that appellants' action was not to review agency action, but it was for a declaration of its rights or status. Therefore, the court held that Fla.

A petition by appellee for review of the suspension was denied for lack of prosecution pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.420(e). Appellee's bad driving habits continued, and appellant revoked appellee's license for five years as a habitual offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.27(5). Appellant denied appellee's petition for reinstatement of his driving privilege. Appellant then petitioned the circuit court for certiorari, claiming that Fla. Stat. chs. 322.64, 322.27(5) and (6), and 322.271, known as the habitual traffic offender act, were unconstitutional. In its order granting certiorari, the circuit court did not pass on the constitutional issue, but granted appellee temporary driving privileges. The appellate court reversed the trial court and quashed the order, finding that the habitual offender statute was constitutional. Further, the court concluded that the trial court erred in granting certiorari in the absence of a record showing that appellant acted without jurisdiction or failed to follow the essential requirements of the law when it revoked appellee's license.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the summary judgment on contribution because appellant was not entitled to contribution from appellee where appellant and appellee did not share a common liability. The court noted that appellant's liability rested on negligence, while appellee's was imposed and limited by the workman's compensation act, Fla. Stat. 440.11(1) (1976). The court reversed the summary judgment on indemnity because the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasor's Act, Fla. Stat. ch.768.31 (1976) did not impair the right to indemnity and that the right of a passive tortfeasor to cross-claim an active tortfeasor was well established.

There was no allegation that appellant dealer operated, conducted, engaged in or carried on any business in the state, and appellant had committed no act in the state. The court held that the fact the injury occurred in the state was crucial to a determination when the cause of action accrued, but the occurrence of the injury alone in the forum state did not satisfy the statutory test. In conclusion, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 48.193(1)(f)2, was unconstitutional, and could not be used to bring appellant into the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, personal representative, brought a suit for damages against appellees alleging that appellant's decedent was sold a prescription medication which caused his death. Allegedly, appellee pharmacist negligently attached a label to the prescription indicating that it was for decedent when in fact it was prescribed for the decedent's daughter. The decedent was a resident of Florida, but owned a store in Georgia where the prescription was sent. Appellee pharmacist was licensed in Georgia where he conducted his business. The issue on appeal was whether the court had jurisdiction over appellee pharmacist who was a nonresident of the State of Florida. The court held that the did not have jurisdiction and affirmed the order of the lower court dismissing appellant's case. The court reasoned that appellee pharmacist did not have the requisite minimum contacts with the State of Florida to satisfy the due process requirements for the court to have jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state agencies, sought review of a declaratory judgment of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which ordered appellants to restore appellee, a former state employee, to his former position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state agencies, argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear the declaratory judgment action of appellee, a fired state employee, because the Administrative Procedure Act (Act), Fla. Stat. chs. 120.68, 120.72 (1975), provided that review of final agency action rested with an appeals court. The court disagreed, noting first that appellee, who timely sought permission to run for public office, was not only dismissed from his position on conflict of interest grounds after meeting the deadline for qualifying to run, but was precluded from appealing his dismissal to the career service commission by an agency rule. Because appellants' action affected appellee's constitutional rights, and because the harm done to him was inordinate, nothing in the Act divested a circuit court of jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment under chapter 120.73 where defects in due process existed, the court ruled. The Act could not impair judicial jurisdiction to determine constitutional disputes that were not within agency power to resolve. Moreover, venue was proper in the county that was the situs of the violations of appellee's rights.</SPAN></P>

Noting that the fundamental constitutional issue was whether the delegation of legislative power was attended by adequate standards, the reviewing court concluded that the standards for the exercise of power in &sect; 380.05(2) were inadequate; consequently, the delegation offended Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. In quashing Rule 22F-8, the court concluded that the statutory limitations on the exercise of the designation power were unconstitutionally vague; the provision did not establish priorities or means for identifying and choosing among the resources the act was intended to preserve but treated alike disparate categories of environmental, historical, natural, and archaeological resources of regional or statewide importance; and lacked suitable standards for identification of local governments whose stewardship of valued resources was to be deemed inadequate to protect such interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teacher was arrested for delivery of marijuana and was placed on probation. A committee of respondent State Board of Education filed a petition to revoke petitioner's teaching certificate.

Respondent rejected the committee's recommendation and instead, permanently revoked petitioner's teaching certificate. Petitioner sought review and the court reversed respondent's decision, holding that it was based upon findings of fact, which petitioner had objected to as erroneous, but which were never ruled upon. The court held that the stipulation was deficient because respondent was not obligated to impose the recommended punishment of the stipulation. The court noted that the controlling statute, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brothers purchased a condominium for the residence of their respective families during visits to Florida. The deed was issued to one brother, who then conveyed one-half of his interest to the other. Plaintiff condominium brought suit to set aside the second deed, arguing that latter defendant's application had not been approved because condominium rules precluded children under the age of 12 from residence. Defendants appealed the judgment in favor of plaintiff, arguing that ownership by two blood brothers was permissible where condominium rules permitted joint ownership. In reversing the judgment in favor of plaintiff and remanding with instructions to enter a final judgment in defendants' favor, the appellate court concluded that because the condominium rules specifically allowed the transfer of ownership to a member of an owner's immediate family, no approval was needed for the transfer at issue; the conveyance was valid. Further, the restriction precluding children was an unconstitutional violation of the right to marry and procreate, and plaintiff failed to establish a compelling reason for refusing children to reside in the condominium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of plaintiff was reversed and the matter was remanded with instructions for entry of a judgment in favor of defendants, for the transfer of ownership was valid and could be effected without plaintiff's permission where condominium rules expressly permitted transfer to immediate family. Further, the restriction precluding children from residence was an unconstitutional restriction and was, thus, invalid.</SPAN></P>

I. The trial court enjoined appellant from enforcing the ordinance. The appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court. The ordinance did not violate First Amendment freedom of speech and expression rights. The ordinance was within appellant board's constitutional and statutory authority and demonstrated a rational exercise of their police power designed to correct conditions adversely affecting the public. Adult females' display of their breasts in public to patrons in a bar was a commercial endeavor, not an expression of their right of free speech or expression. The ordinance did not conflict with the Beverage Act, Fla. Stat. chs. 561 and 562 (1951), because the ordinance governed conduct of persons while on the premises of establishments that sold alcohol and did not attempt to regulate the sale and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

The court also reasoned that Fla.

The court further concluded that petitioner consented to an informal proceeding under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57(2), which did not require that a hearing officer from the Division of Administrative Hearings of the Florida Department of Administration be assigned to conduct the hearing. The court additionally determined that the evidence in support of the order of revocation was both competent and substantial and that petitioner failed to show that the hearing officer abused his discretion by refusing the motion of petitioner's counsel to continue the hearing.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought judicial review of respondent's order, arguing, inter alia, that the overwhelming weight of the evidence demonstrated that his proposed filling was necessary to enhance the utility and quality of the preserve. The court agreed with petitioner, holding that respondent erred in denying petitioner's application. Not only were petitioner's lands excluded by Fla.

Respondent department then denied petitioner's application. Upon judicial review, the court granted the petition for review and quashed respondent department's order.

Mexico Beach Ord. 35, &sect; 13(d) provided for the imposition of a lien against an owner's property for failure to pay the assessments. Appellant owners refused to pay the assessments and appellee filed a claim of lien against their properties. Appellee then passed Mexico Beach Ord. 50, which amended &sect; 13(d) to include assessment of costs and attorney's fees incurred in enforcing the liens. Appellants challenged the ordinances and liens as unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinances, imposed liens against appellants' properties in the amounts found due, and ordered the properties sold to satisfy the liens. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the ordinances because the classifications were not unreasonable or arbitrary. The court reversed the assessment of attorney's fees, because there was no indication that the ordinance was intended to apply retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

When respondent board of dentistry issued petitioner a conditional renewal certificate, pursuant to Fla.

Petitioner sought review, and the court reversed, holding that the statute was unconstitutional because it required both residence and domicile as a condition precedent to the issuance of an annual renewal certificate. The court held that respondent's claim that the statute insured that only qualified dentists practice in the state did not present a sufficiently compelling governmental interest. The court noted that residence laws are measured by a strict equal protection test, which put a heavy burden of justification on respondent, due to the importance of an unburdened right to travel.

The complaint sought, among other things, damages for loss of decedent's net accumulations under the Florida Wrongful Death Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.21(6)(a) (1975). The circuit court granted appellees partial summary judgment, eliminating the request for damages under ch. 768.21(6)(a). The court affirmed the circuit court's order. The court ruled that decedent's adult children were not entitled to recovery under ch. 768.21(6)(a). Specifically, the court found that non-dependent adult children were not considered &quot;survivors&quot; under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.18(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent accused was charged with knowingly loitering in a place were narcotics were used or possessed, violation of the Code of Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., &sect; 21-31.1(b)(2). During the trial, respondent filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the loitering statute was unconstitutional because it was unfair and overly broad. The motion was initially denied by the metropolitan court, but the state court reversed respondent's conviction on appeal. The court found that it had to assume that the legislative body that formulated the ordinance intended for it to be valid. The court held that &sect; 21-31.1(b)(2) required that one must have knowledge of another's unlawful possession of narcotics. This specific culpability requirement and stringent standard for conviction was actually clearer than the state loitering statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 856.021 (1973). The court quashed the judgment by the state court and reinstated the conviction and sentence of respondent because the knowledge requirement demonstrated that the ordinance was not overbroad, but rather mandated a stringent standard.</SPAN></P>

Respondent subsequently adopted comprehensive land development regulations concerning the swamp area that became effective on July 20, 1975. Petitioners sought judicial review of respondent's rulemaking action, contending that its action was invalid. In granting petitioners' prayer for relief, the reviewing court concluded that because the regulations did not become effective within 12 months of the adoption of the rule designating the area to be of critical state concern, the rule designation automatically terminated by operation of Fla. Stat. ch. 380.05(12) on July 16, 1975. The regulations that would have become effective had the designation survived were, thus, deprived of a statutory predicate and could not become effective. The legislature specifically imposed a self-destruct mechanism for rule designations that were not timely implemented by effective development regulations, and the court could not ignore its effect.</SPAN></P>

Appellant moved to dismiss, arguing that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, and challenged the denial of its motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Marketable Record Title Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 712 (1975), extinguished claims of 30 years or more which conflicted with a record chain of title that was at least that old. Defendant landowners' chain of title was of record and exceeded 30 years, and covered lands that had once lain under navigable waters, but had been filled, platted, and in some cases conveyed by defendants or their predecessors in title. The land under these waters had devolved to plaintiff city via grant from the United States to the state of Florida, and a grant from the state to plaintiff for municipal purposes only. The court affirmed the judgments for defendants. The court held that the time when the land was filled was not determinative under the Act. The Act was applicable to wild or void deeds. The Act applied to plaintiff city, despite plaintiff's claim to be a trustee for the public, or state agency, because the Act made no such exception, and public and private entities alike were bound by it. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional as applied, given that plaintiff had some 10 years notice to have asserted a cognizable claim under Fla. Stat. ch. 712.05 (1975).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, unit owners and condominium association, sought review of the trial court's (Florida) partial summary judgment upholding a rent increase. Plaintiffs argued Fla. Stat. ch. 711.236, which rendered rent escalation clauses unenforceable, should be applied retroactively. Defendants cross appealed, asserting that chapter 711.236 was unconstitutional and the Declaration of Condominium did not incorporate the provisions of chapter 711.236.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, unit owners and condominium association, brought suit against defendants, who were directors of the condominium development corporation, and lessors of the recreational facilities. The lease was a mandatory condition of purchasing the condominiums. Defendants demanded an increase in rent under an escalation clause in the Declaration of Condominium (Declaration). Plaintiffs sought inter alia, declaratory relief with respect to their rights and obligations under Fla. Stat. ch. 711.236 (1975), which became law after the creation of the Declaration. Chapter 711.236 declared escalation clauses in condominium recreation leases void for public policy and prohibited their enforcement. The trial judge granted partial summary judgment allowing the rent increase, but prohibiting any further rent escalations. Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed, holding that the statute was not retroactive, and the trial judge properly refused to invalidate the rent increase which occurred before the effective date of the statute. The court also held the trial judge properly ruled that chapter 711.236 by virtue of the express wording of the Declaration itself was incorporated into it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court decision finding the statute declaring escalation clauses in condominium recreation leases void for public policy and prohibiting their enforcement applied prospectively only; and which also held that the Declaration of Condominium incorporated legislative amendments. The court held that the statute was inapplicable to contracts which antedated its enactment, however the prohibition did apply prospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator requested mediation of a malpractice claim against several doctors and a hospital under the Medical Malpractice Reform Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.44 (1976). Relator then challenged the statute's constitutionality and sought to have the claim transferred to circuit court. Respondent, the judicial referee of the medical panel, granted dismissal on the ground the statute was unconstitutional and transferred the cause to the circuit court. After the Florida Supreme Court upheld the statute's constitutionality, respondent granted relator's prior motion to reinstate the mediation. Relator sought a writ of prohibition against respondent, claiming the 10-month time limit for a hearing on the claims established by Fla. Stat. ch. 768.44(3) (1976) had expired and that respondent no longer had jurisdiction. The court dismissed relator's petition. Respondent had no authority to dismiss the mediation proceedings. However, since relator asked for that order, the medical defendants should not thereby be deprived of their right to mediation. There still adhered to the mediation panel the time which remained on the 10-month statutory period at the time the unauthorized order was entered.</SPAN></P>

A hearing officer of the division of administrative hearings of the DOA entered a final order, ruling that the directive and the DOA guidelines were rules, under Fla.

Petitioners argued that the hearing officer's order was a judicial determination that he was without authority to make. The court affirmed the order. The hearing officer acted with authority, as he performed a quasi-judicial function authorized by Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The directive and the DOA guidelines were rules because they were agency policy statements of general applicability that were applied with full force of a rule of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a citizen's complaint, a police officer approached defendant's automobile, which was parked in a vacant lot. The officer detected a strong odor of burning marijuana as he approached the vehicle. When defendant was searched, the officer found a packet of phencyclidine in a pouch hanging from defendant's belt. Defendant was subsequently arrested and convicted on a charge of possession of a controlled substance in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(e). The court affirmed the judgment and sentence, holding that the narcotic seized from defendant was not the fruit of an illegal, warrantless search and that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. Although the warrantless search was conducted prior to arrest, it was conducted subsequent to the establishment of probable cause to arrest. The court held that the odor of marijuana provided probable cause to arrest defendant prior to the search and the fact that defendant was not arrested until after the search did not render the evidence found inadmissible. Further, the evidence at issue was discovered within the permissible scope of the warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

In granting petitioner's request and issuing the writ of prohibition, the appellate court concluded that because an adequate remedy was available under the APA, jurisdiction of the circuit court was correspondingly limited. Generally, judicial deference to administrative procedures was required, and although the APA did not and could not displace circuit court jurisdiction to enjoin enforcement of facially unconstitutional agency rules, no showing was made that the agency rules were unconstitutional, that the state agency acted illegally, or that, had it acted illegally, the APA could not remedy that illegality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant County of Pasco enacted a zoning ordinance, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 163 (1975), and adopted zoning maps for property within the county. The property owned by appellees, corporation and its partners, was zoned by the ordinance and maps as agricultural/residential. Appellees filed a complaint, seeking to declare the ordinance void and enjoin appellant's enforcement of the ordinance against appellees' property. Count three of appellees' complaint alleged that the zoning was unconstitutional because the zoning maps adopted by appellant's planning commission portrayed certain property differently than had been decided by the planning commission at an earlier date. The trial court denied appellant's motion to strike count three of appellees' complaint. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying its motion to dismiss, as appellees could not contest the constitutional validity of the ordinance on the ground that other property which was not owned by them was improperly zoned. The trial court reversed the order, holding that appellees could not challenge the ordinance, as appellees' rights were not adversely affected by it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of an order of the trial court (Florida), which, following a remand from the court of the trial court's previous order of dismissal of appellee property conveyors' action for declaratory judgment regarding a portion of Escambia County, Fla., Ordinance 73-9 pertaining subdivision regulations declared unconstitutional, found the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county insisted on the right to prosecute appellee property conveyors for failure to comply with Escambia County, Fla., Ordinance 73-9, pertaining property division and subdivisions, after appellees transferred parcels of property. In its initial decision, the trial court dismissed appellees' action for declaratory judgment regarding constitutionality of portions of Escambia County, Fla., Ordinance 73-9, holding that the suit was improperly brought. After the court reversed and remanded, the trial court found the ordinance unconstitutional and appellant county sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 163.275 (1971), the statute that the ordinance was allegedly based upon, did not affect persons not desiring to sell land by reference to a subdivision, and that the ordinance was invalid because it did not fall within the scope of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, while a student at a public elementary school, was injured on the school premises allegedly as a result of negligence in maintenance. Plaintiff and her parents sued defendant, the county school board and its insurance company. Upon authority of a portion of Fla.

The motion was granted, and plaintiffs' petition for writ of certiorari was denied. The insurance company was severed from the trial and any mention of insurance was prohibited. Plaintiffs filed an appeal and assigned as error the order of severance of defendant's insurance company. The court reversed the order, because on case law holding that if the trial court granted severance absent a justiciable issue relating to insurance, such as a question of coverage or of the applicability or interpretation of the insurance policy or other such valid dispute on the matter of insurance coverage, the court committed harmful error.</SPAN></P>

The court held that while a &quot;fair share&quot; rule differed in degree from an &quot;agency shop&quot; rule requiring payment of the equivalent of a month's union dues, it was nevertheless repugnant to art. I, &sect; 6, because anything that imposed a charge upon the free exercise of a right abridged the use and enjoyment of the right, and a fair shop rule taxed the right to work.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a city, sought review of the judgment from the Dade County Circuit Court (Florida) that held that appellant was in technical contempt for violating the terms of an annexation agreement by taxing appellee, a landowner's, undeveloped land that was part of a tract annexed to appellant pursuant to an agreement wherein appellant agreed not to tax the undeveloped land. Appellant claimed that the agreement violated Fla. Const. art. 7, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a city, had an agreement with the predecessor in interest of appellee, a landowner, wherein a tract of land owned by the predecessor would be annexed to the city and appellant would not tax any undeveloped part of the tract. The agreement was approved by the trial court and adopted by appellant's ordinance, and the tract was annexed pursuant to 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 30111. Seventeen years later, appellant placed the remaining undeveloped parts of the tract on its tax rolls, and appellee intervened in the ensuing litigation. The trial court held that appellant was in technical contempt for violating the agreement. On appeal, the court held that appellant's power to exempt real estate from taxation was not a general power, but was limited to the purposes of Fla. Const. art. 7, &sect; 1. Because the exemption in the agreement was in derogation of uniformity and equality in appellant's real estate taxation, the tax exemption in the agreement was invalid under the Florida constitution, and thus appellant was not estopped from challenging the validity of the exemption. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the tax exemption in the agreement was invalid because it was not made in compliance with the Florida constitution and it violated the public policy that real estate taxes be assessed uniformly and equally.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a motion to transfer the cause to the county where its headquarters were located. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant sought interlocutory appeal. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28 (1973) authorized limited tort claims against the state and its agencies. Further, state policy required that actions against state agencies had to be instituted in the county where the agency's official residence was established. However, venue could be waived by an agency or the action could fall within an exception to the venue rule. The court reversed the order and remanded with directions to transfer the case to the county where appellant was headquartered because appellees instituted the tort action against appellant, and venue was proper in the county of appellant's headquarters because appellant neither waived venue nor did appellees' action fall within an exception to the venue rule.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the sheriff holds a constitutional office. An &quot;office&quot; is an agency of the state. The sheriff holds the office of sheriff. It follows that the sheriff is an agency of the state, and thus comes within the definition of &quot;public employer.&quot; Additionally, even though they were appointed, deputy sheriffs were &quot;public employees&quot; under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of a Florida trial court, which denied his motion to suppress evidence found incident to an arrest for violation of a city ordinance against disturbing the peace. Defendant had entered a plea of nolo contendere to the offense of possession of less than five grams of cannabis and possession of barbiturates, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a report of a fight, police officers found defendant &quot;banging&quot; on an apartment door to gain entry. An occupant told the officers that he did not wish to place charges but that he did want defendant to leave. The officers, after advising defendant that they were not going to arrest him, urged that he leave. As the officers left, they again saw defendant &quot;banging&quot; on the door and creating a disturbance. The officers returned immediately, arrested defendant, charged him with disturbing the peace, and searched him, finding contraband. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's conviction of possession of less than five grams of cannabis and possession of barbiturates because the search and seizure were the direct result of an arrest based upon a city ordinance, which was constitutional on its face and as construed. The court held that defendant's conduct was creating a disturbance and was not constitutionally protected speech. His conduct constituted probable cause to justify his arrest for violation of the city ordinance. The court held that the ordinance was not facially incompatible with the state or federal constitutions under the facts in the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of guilty and the sentence imposed because the officers' search and seizure of defendant was the direct result of an arrest based upon a city ordinance, which was constitutional as applied to the particular factual circumstances of the case. Defendant's conduct constituted probable cause to justify his arrest for violation of the subject ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee suspect was arrested and charged with both possession and sale of marijuana. The count charging sale was nolle prossed when appellee pleaded guilty to possession and he was placed on probation with adjudication of guilt withheld. After his probationary period ended, he filed a motion to expunge the record. Appellant state argued that the motion was improperly granted because the nolle prosequi was not an &quot;adjudication of nonguilt&quot; as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 901.33 (1975). The reviewing court upheld the expungement. It chose to interpret ambiguous provisions in the statute in the spirit expressed in the first sentence. Appellee, having been released without being adjudicated guilty, was entitled to the statutory remedy. A subsequent conviction on other charges did not cause appellee to lose his benefits. The reviewing court sealed the records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant massage parlor sought review on an interlocutory appeal of the order of the Orange County Circuit Court (Florida) which denied appellant's motion to dismiss appellee state's complaint for injunction or abatement of a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant massage parlor was alleged to engage employees who would masturbate male customers by hand during body shampoos. Appellee state filed a petition to close appellant as a public nuisance for lewdness. The complaint alleged that appellant provided services that consisted of body shampoos and/or masturbation. The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss the complaint. On appeal, the court held that, although masturbation for hire by a female of a male customer under the circumstances alleged in the complaint was an indecent act and thus constituted lewdness and was subject to being declared a nuisance under Fla. Stat. ch. 823.05, the language of the complaint did not withstand a motion to dismiss because the use of the combined conjunctive and disjunctive phrase &quot;and/or&quot; gutted the complaint. The complaint essentially alleged that the services complained of consisted of either innocent acts or wrongful acts. Further, the scope of the injunctive relief requested was too broad because it sought to enjoin the entire business and not just the particular acts alleged to constitute a nuisance. The order was reversed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of appellant massage parlor's motion to dismiss because the complaint for abatement of a public nuisance filed by appellee state used the combined conjunctive and disjunctive phrase &quot;and/or,&quot; essentially gutting the complaint of its allegations of wrongful acts.</SPAN></P>

Also, appellant was insured under a policy issued by appellee. A dispute arose as to the amount of uninsured motorist coverage, which was available to appellant under the policy. The trial court held that appellants had failed to establish that the vehicle involved in the accident was intended to be a family automobile and not a corporate vehicle. As such, insufficient evidence was introduced to show that appellee was required to increase its uninsured motorist limits. Since appellant did not demonstrate error, the decision of the trial court was upheld.</SPAN></P>

Appellant used expletives in response to a request from police officers to move from the roadway to the sidewalk, which caused others in the area to gather at the scene and resulted in other persons yelling expletives at the officers. When the officers attempted to arrest appellant, she bit and struck them, and otherwise violently attempted to obstruct them in the performance of their duties. The court affirmed the adjudication of delinquency, finding that under the circumstances and atmosphere of the incident the conduct of appellant constituted a breach of the peace under Fla. Stat. ch. 877.03. The court determined that the actions of appellant in obstructing the officers' attempts to arrest her for breach of the peace constituted assault and battery and resisting arrest. The court concluded that even if appellant should not have been charged with disturbing the peace, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor challenged his adjudication in the lower court (Florida), for breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a misdemeanor, and urged that evidence of his confession should have been suppressed because the deputy sheriff made an unconstitutional arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's deputy requested that appellant minor accompany him to police headquarters to examine a well-founded suspicion that appellant participated in recent burglaries. Appellant tentatively challenged the requested interview by asking its purpose. When the deputy parried that inquiry, and so tacitly asserted his will and authority to proceed without explanation, the acquiescing youth was taken by patrol car for questioning at headquarters in a police-dominated atmosphere. Appellant was read Miranda warnings and confessed after 30 to 40 minutes of questioning. The court held that considering appellant's youth, the deputy's methods and the purposeful formality of the headquarters visitation restrained appellant's liberty to a degree cognizable under U.S. Const. amend. IV, and that the imminent interrogation was custodial and therefore attended by guaranties of U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant minor's delinquent adjudication, holding that the state could not constitutionally invite appellant to relinquish U.S. Const. amend. IV privacies, withhold the information or explanation appellant thought was necessary to his decision, and then characterize as voluntary the resulting submission to authority.</SPAN></P>

Before the developer's petition was scheduled to be voted upon, petitioner and other city employees went to California at the developer's expense in order to view a completed development. As a result, respondent Florida Commission on Ethics found that petitioner violated Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(1) (1973) as amended by 1974 Fla. Laws 74-177. On petition for a writ of certiorari, the court held that the language of ch. 112.313, prohibiting petitioner from accepting any gift that would cause a reasonably prudent person to be influenced in the discharge of his or her official duties, did not convey a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. Thus, the statute violated due process of law and was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the right to due process was not limited to criminal statutes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county enacted an ordinance regulating bingo games. Plaintiffs, church and individuals, sought a permanent injunction to restrain defendant's enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court denied the injunction. Plaintiffs appealed. Plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance was preempted by state law, was improperly acted, did not constitute a valid exercise of the police power, violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and defendant lacked authority to enact it. The reviewing court affirmed. The appellate court found no preemption existed because Fla. Stat. ch. 849.093 was enacted merely to eliminate bingo from a gambling chapter of the statutes. Compliance with the ordinance was possible without violating state law. Further, because inspections of plaintiff church's records could only be made at reasonable times during normal business hours, no unreasonable searches, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, were authorized. The purpose of theordinance was to protect legitimate, charitable organizations from profit seekers, and the ordinance established a reasonable classification that was related to this legitimate government objective. Thus, no equal protection issues arose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed appellants' complaints, which the court in turn reversed on appeal. The court held that Jacksonville Housing Code &sect; 906-304.13 was discriminatory and unconstitutionally applied, because it illegally discriminated between buildings with central heating and air conditioning and those without, by requiring that screen doors be installed only in buildings without central heat and air-conditioning. The court further held that Jacksonville Housing Code &sect; 906.306.5 was unconstitutional because it was beyond appellee city's police power to require owners to invade their tenants' privacy and keep the interior of the apartments free from pests. This duty could be imposed only upon the occupant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant gas pipeline company filed a third party amended complaint against appellee power company seeking indemnity by reason of contractual provisions and contribution as a joint tort-feasor, in defense of a wrongful death suit filed by widows of two power company employees killed as a result of a gas explosion. Subsequent to a jury verdict in favor of the widows, the trial court dismissed appellant's third party amended complaint. On appeal, the court held that appellee had the sole duty to safely handle the volatile gas after taking delivery and reversed the judgment rendered against appellant. The supreme court granted certiorari, and quashed the court's opinion with directions that the judgment be reinstated. The court found that there was no specific contract of indemnity because appellant had a nondelegable duty to odorize the gas delivered to appellant as a matter of law, and that the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.31(2)(a) (1975), provided that no right of contribution existed because appellee's liability was imposed by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, while that of appellant rested on the principles of negligence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the legislature affirmatively passed a law in which rape was deleted from the list of offenses under the Act. Despite what the court believed, it may have been that the legislature did not wish to give those defendants convicted of the most heinous of the crimes defined under the Act the opportunity of obtaining an early release following treatment at a mental hospital.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction finding chapter 856.021 constitutional, and the evidence and reasonable inferences met the statute's elements. First, the court found that defendant spent nights on a street corner in an area where she did not live, approached vehicles and conversed with the drivers. A police officer observed defendant on previous occasions and had written almost 40 field cards on her. Second, the court ruled that defendant's conduct threatened to breach the peace because her actions impaired traffic flow, and the officer had reason to believe defendant was soliciting prostitution in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07. The court found the officer performed his duty in compliance with the statute and gave defendant an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern and confronted her prior to arrest. The court held that evidence that the officer had written roughly 40 field cards on defendant was relevant and admissible because it proved defendant's purpose, plan, and design for the collateral crime of soliciting prostitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Florida Department of Citrus sought review of an order from the trial court (Florida), which awarded attorney's fees to appellees, a class of citrus producers, for the alleged services rendered by counsel for the benefit of appellees and payable out of a fund allegedly preserved as a result of such services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the appellant Florida Department of Citrus promulgated a marketing order which included an assessment of five cents per box of oranges, appellees, a class of citrus producers, sued on the primary ground that the marketing order was unconstitutional. After much litigation and appeals, the parties agreed with the trial court there was a reasonable probability of working out a marketing program that would not be objectionable, and appellees sought voluntary dismissal. The trial court subsequently awarded appellees attorney's fees for services performed by counsel during the course of the class action. On review, the appellate court reversed the award of attorney's fees, finding that appellees' counsel had obtained a political victory, not a legal victory. The appellate court concluded by noting that the amended marketing order and any potential further developments represented policy or political concessions, rather than the resolution of legal rights in and to a fund within the confines of the issues remaining in the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the order awarding attorney's fees to appellees, a class of citrus producers, against appellant Florida Department of Citrus and remanded with directions to deny the requested award. There was no entitlement to such fees where appellees' counsel's seeking a voluntary dismissal of the suit in response to an agreement to work out another marketing program was a political victory, rather than a legal one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of a Florida trial court on constitutional grounds following the trial of an action brought by appellee state, wherein the court determined that appellant should be involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394.467(2), on account of having attacked members of his family who were also put in fear of their lives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state brought an action against appellant arising out of appellant's attack on his family. The trial court, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394.467(1), had appellant involuntarily hospitalized. Appellant challenged the decision claiming that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad, and that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a psychiatrist's evaluation derived from controlled interrogation and observations made while appellant did not understand the Miranda warnings. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. It concluded that the record supported the finding that if left at liberty appellant would be likely to injure himself or others, and that the criteria providing for involuntary hospitalization under those circumstances was not overly vague. The court held that the claim that the statute was overly broad because it did not provide for a lesser form of relief was an argument for the legislature but was not a basis for striking the statute, and was not applicable to the facts presented on the appeal. The court also held that since appellant was not accused of a crime, Miranda was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of appellee state and affirmed the lower court's decision to involuntarily hospitalize appellant because the record supported the trial court's finding that appellant, if not confined, would likely injure himself or others, and because the court held that appellant's constitutional challenges to the proceedings were not applicable to the facts presented on appeal and were therefore without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sold and distributed water to utility customers outside the city limits. Appellee public service commission brought a suit against appellant and claimed that appellant sold the water at rates which exceeded the maximum allowed under Fla.

Appellee admitted it had not regulatory authority over the rates charged by appellant under Fla. Stat. ch. 367.022(2), but claimed standing on its own behalf and on behalf of the customers who purchased the water. The court denied appellant's motion to dismiss the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered the trial court to dismiss the action. The court held that appellee was not the proper party to maintain the action. Appellee did not satisfy the direct injury requirement, and appellee had not been designated by statute as a consumer advocate for utilities not under its regulatory authority. The court held that the legislature did not intend appellant to be subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the trial court, which convicted two of the defendants for possession of more than five grams of marijuana, and one defendant of possession of less than five grams of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for marijuana possession. The court affirmed the convictions, finding no basis in any of the several points of appeal to reverse the trial court. Defendants' attempt to purchase a $ 10,000 cashier's check without identification, which was reported to law enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service, was not the type of transaction covered by the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1051 et seq. The planting of a beeper on defendant's car and ensuing seizure of contraband were not illegal because police maintained independent visual contact with the car. It was not error to refuse to permit defendants to adduce evidence that there were three species of cannabis, because Fla. Stat. ch. 893.02(2) applies to any species or variety of cannabis. Police had probable cause to stop and search defendants' vehicles when they entered an area of reported marijuana activity and then left the area appearing to be heavily loaded. It was within the discretion of the trial court to allow an expert to testify that the vegetable matter he examined was marijuana. Evidence was overwhelming that defendants possessed more than five grams of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions for marijuana possession were affirmed, as trial court had not erred in refusing to suppress evidence of defendants' drug possession and activity. It was not error to allow experts to testify that vegetable matter was marijuana, nor to refuse to allow testimony as to different species of cannabis. Evidence presented at trial was sufficient to establish that defendants possessed more than five grams of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 193.481(1). Appellees filed an action for declaratory relief challenging the tax. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees and held that appellants, tax assessors, could not levy ad valorem taxes against appellees for the mineral leases. The court affirmed and held that appellees' mineral leases constituted only a right to search and sever oil from real property. The leases did not create an interest or estate in realty because they did not involve a conveyance of the mineral interest. The court observed that fee interest could be split horizontally and vertically. However, the fee owners did not split the mineral interest. The court noted that the statutes imposing taxes must by clear, and were liberally construed in favor of the taxpayer. The court found that amendments to ch. 193.481 created ambiguity in the statute. Finally, the court recognized that appellants were otherwise compensated for mineral exploration through excise taxes levied against appellees.</SPAN></P>

Appellee claimed that he had not consented to his release under Fla. Stat. ch. 947.17 (1973), and therefore appellant's control pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee prisoner had been sentenced to five years imprisonment, but was subsequently released under &quot;mandatory conditional release&quot; pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 944.291 (1973), for an accumulation of statutory and extra gain time. At the time of his release, appellee refused to sign a consent form or to verbally agree to the terms of the release. Appellee was later arrested for violation of the release terms, and appellee filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, contending that appellant state's control over him, pursuant to Fla.

The court reversed and held that the trial court's ruling was based on the erroneous assumption that appellee was on parole, which required consent under Fla. Stat. ch. 947.17(1) (1973).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent board of dental examiners acting on a recommended order of the hearing officer, found that petitioner dentist had committed felonies in the third degree, proscribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 893(1973), and suspended petitioner's dental license for six months. Petitioner asserted that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in its description of proscribed misconduct and, consequently, that a suspension order could not be predicated on it. The court held that the harsh penalty imposed by respondent was not justified in this case. Therefore, the court disregard respondent's finding that petitioner committed a felony by obtaining possession of morphine sulfate in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(3)(a). However, the court also held that petitioner's conduct offended state and federal law, encouraged carelessness if not permissiveness in the observance of drug control, and, ultimately, reflected discredit on a profession which was and must be trusted to adhere scrupulously to drug control laws. Therefore, the court remanded the cause for appropriate sanction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of business regulation sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court (Florida), which determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 83.49(2) did not require appellee landlord to pay interest on his tenants' security deposits, and that appellant had neither the power to fine appellees or to revoke their license for failure to comply with ch. 83.49(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of business regulation instituted administrative action against appellee landlord, alleging that appellee failed to pay interest on his tenants' security deposits as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 83.49. Ultimately, the lower court held that appellant did not have the authority to impose a fine against appellees or to revoke their license for failure to comply with either ch. 83.49 or Fla. Stat. ch. 83.261 because these statutes did not apply retrospectively so as to apply to appellee's lease agreements with his tenants. The court held that ch. 83.49 did not require appellee to pay interest on the security deposits at issue prior to the statute's effective date because there was no clear indication of any legislative intent to the contrary. Furthermore, the court held that appellant did not have the power to fine appellee or revoke their license for failure to comply with ch. 83.49(2) because at the time the parties' case was tried, there was no statutory authority granting appellant such power. The court noted, however, a subsequent amendment that would give appellant such authority in appropriate cases in the future. As such, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that appellant department of business regulation did not have authority to impose a fine against or to revoke appellee landlord's license for failing to pay interest to tenants on their security deposits, because the statutes giving appellant such authority and requiring interest to be paid did not apply retroactively and were inapplicable to appellee's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public employees relations commission sought review of an order from a trial court (Florida), which denied appellant's application for injunction that would have prevented appellee municipality from enforcing or implementing a local ordinance that established provisions and procedures for appellee's own public employees relations commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that denied appellant public employees relations commission's application for an injunction. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 447.603 (1974), appellee municipality established its own provisions and procedures for appellee's own public employees relations commission. Appellant sought to enjoin appellee from implementing the ordinance until appellant had approved its terms, and the trial court denied the injunction. On appeal the issue was whether appellant's approval was required before appellee was entitled to assume jurisdiction of the public employee bargaining procedure. The reviewing court found that it was important to have reasonably consistent interpretations because the administration of collective bargaining with public employees was a complex area of law. The court held that a municipality could have no jurisdiction unless appellant had approved the provisions and procedures of its ordinance. The court noted that delegation of this responsibility for determining whether local standards were equivalent to those enacted by the legislature did not appear to be an unconstitutional infringement.</SPAN></P>

At the same time, appellee moved for prejudgment garnishment against appellant garnishee, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 77.031 et seq. (1973), seeking to attach appellant's debt to original defendant. The trial court entered a final judgment against the property of original defendant owed to him by appellant as garnishee, and entered a personal judgment against appellant for the amount due appellee by original defendant. Appellant filed an interlocutory appeal of the trial court's denial of his motion to set aside the judgment in garnishment. The court reversed the trial court order denying appellant's motion, holding that appellee's judgment against the original defendant was invalid. Because the judgment against original defendant was invalid, no final judgment could be entered against appellant, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 77.081 (1973).</SPAN></P>
