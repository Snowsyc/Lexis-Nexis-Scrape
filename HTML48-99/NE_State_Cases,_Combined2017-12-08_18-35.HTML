</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a licensed wholesaler of wine and spirits, appealed the judgment from the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which upheld the &quot;post and hold&quot; laws. The trial court denied the wholesaler's request to enjoin defendant Nebraska Liquor Control Commission from the enforcement of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53-168, 53-168.03 (Cum. Supp. 1982), 53-168.01, 53-168.02, 53-168.04, and 53-168.05 (Reissue 1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The &quot;post and hold&quot; laws required wholesalers of wines and spirits to post their resale prices each month with the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, and limited them to two price reductions per item in any year. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-168.03 (Cum. Supp. 1982) wholesalers were prohibited from amending their price schedules to reflect quantity discounts. Additionally, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-168 (Cum. Supp. 1982) wholesalers were prohibited from giving quantity discounts and retailers were prohibited from receiving them. The wholesaler sought injunctive relief against the enforcement of these &quot;post and hold&quot; statutes. The trial court found that they did not violate either the Nebraska Constitution or the Sherman Act. On appeal, the court concluded that price-fixing did not promote the public health, safety, or welfare, or the orderly marketing of liquor. Because the legislature enacted the provisions of &sect; 53-168 together with the price-posting laws as an integrated scheme, all of the statutes were unconstitutional, except for the portion of &sect; 53-168 that did not relate to quantity discounts. The court overruled Central Markets West, Inc. v. State, 180 N.W.2d 880 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that refused to restrain the enforcement of the post and hold laws that fixed the prices for wholesalers of wines and spirits. The court remanded the matter with directions to enter a judgment in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sections 50-201, -202 permitted members of the state legislature to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. The attorney general prevailed in the trial court with his argument that these statutes were unconstitutional. Appellants contested the judgment and secured relief. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 50-201 did not violate Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 because the statute was nothing more than a legislative declaration that the legislature had evaluated Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 50-202 and determined it to be a constitutional exercise of the legislature's authority. The effect of the relevant portion of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, was that legislators must receive their salary and actual expenses in traveling by the most usual route once to and returning from each regular or special session. They could, in addition, receive reimbursement for other expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their duties as authorized by the legislature through the appropriation of funds. The enactment of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 50-201, -202 (1982) did no more than implement the constitutionally permitted reimbursement of the aforesaid expenses.</SPAN></P>

The ordinances did not allow a new and unknown use because the property had been used in a manner incompatible with the surrounding suburban-zoned property for 17 years. The homeowners failed to produce clear and satisfactory evidence that the ordinances were not in accord with a comprehensive plan, and the court concluded they were enacted with due regard to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community and within the statutorily-granted powers in Neb.

This decision was affirmed by the trial court and the court. Although the facility asserted that the State's plan pursuant to Neb. Pub. Welfare Man., IX-6000, Supp. A, &sect; 1400(b), lacked specificity, the court determined that this regulation was not particularly obscure. The court also found that &sect; 1400(b), which created a presumption that nursing homes that failed to meet a certain occupancy rate were inefficient, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the disputed classification was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. Further, the court found no indication that &sect; 1400(b) violated U.S. Const. art. VI, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(13)(E), or 42 C.F.R. &sect; 447.302(b) (1979), because it decided that &sect; 1400(b) did not create unreasonable reimbursement rates.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, Attorney General of the State of Nebraska, filed an original action against defendant, Tax Commissioner of the State of Nebraska, for a declaratory judgment that a part of the Nebraska corporate franchise tax, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-2734(2) (Cum. Supp. 1982), constituted a discriminatory franchise tax prohibited by 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742 and 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124(a), and was, therefore, invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">I.R.C. &sect; 103 was amended to provide that although interest on obligations of a state remained excluded from gross income, interest on obligations of the United States was includable in gross income. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-2734(2) (Cum. Supp. 1982), Nebraska continued to retain &quot;federal taxable income derived from all sources within the State&quot; as the base for corporate franchise tax liability. Nebraska's failure to adapt &sect; 77-2734(2) in light of the change in federal income tax law resulted in a franchise tax with a base excluding interest from obligations of a state but including interest on federal obligations. The Attorney General filed a declaratory judgment action against the Tax Commissioner. The court held that &sect; 77-2734(2) conflicted with 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742 and 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124(a), and, therefore, that the franchise tax imposed by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-2734(2) (Cum. Supp. 1982), insofar as such tax was based on interest attributable to a federal obligation, was invalid under federal law.Section 77-2734(2) sheltered nonfederal securities but left federal securities at a disadvantage by precluding availability of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-2741 (Reissue 1981) to corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative commenced a wrongful death action against various physicians and registered nurse anesthetist. The representative joined all of the defendants in a single petition and alleged, without facts, that the provisions of the Nebraska Hospital-Medical Liability Act (Act) violated both the federal and state constitutions. On appeal, the court held that dismissing the action as to the physician on the basis of improper joinder of parties, not apparent on the face of the petition, was improper. The record contained no evidence offered at trial. Thus, the court could not determine whether the physician was a qualified health care provider who had elected to come under the Act. Further, it could not pass on the constitutionality of the Act where the representative offered no arguments as to why it should be considered constitutional. The court ruled that courts must have the evidence properly presented in proper pleadings before the evidence may be considered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute in question intended to make it a crime for someone to make terroristic threats. The elements of the crime involved appeared to be (1) the actor had to threaten to commit a crime, and (2) the crime had to be likely to result in death or serious physical injury to another person, or (3) the crime had to be likely to result in substantial property damage to another person. The trial court noted that the statute was vague and uncertain as to what constituted a threat. The act did not define the term, nor did it describe how or to whom, if anyone, the threat must have been made. The State argued that the act was modeled after the Model Penal Code and that, while certain words were omitted, the omitted words should nevertheless have been read into the statute by the trial court. By rejecting the language of the Model Penal Code and opting instead for the language in question, the court assumed the Legislature intended to omit the words that the State urged it to supply. The trial court was correct in its determination, and for that reason the judgment of the trial court in declaring &sect; 28-311&nbsp;unconstitutional was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The court found that the order of the personnel board, like the order or any intermediate court or administrative agency, was final and binding unless appealed. The court reasoned that the words &quot;final and binding&quot; referred to the decision of the personnel board and rendered the decision of the personnel board final and binding unless set aside by judicial review. Also, the court found that the collective bargaining agreement that attempted to compel the parties to arbitrate was against public policy and void.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-3301 et seq. (Reissue 1979), and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grocery store was burglarized, with over $ 700 in food stamps and cash being taken, along with merchandise. Fingerprints and palm prints, less than 24 hours old, were found on various articles throughout the store. Defendant was seen shortly after the burglary talking to a young boy and telling him that &quot;It is over there.&quot; The boy then walked to a steel shed. The witness who overheard the statement told the storeowner. The storeowner searched the shed and found items stolen from his store. Based upon this evidence, the police prepared an affidavit seeking an order pursuant to the identifying physical characteristics act to compel defendant to submit to fingerprinting and palm printing. The order was issued and the fingerprints found in the store matched defendant's. At trial, the evidence consisted of the fingerprint evidence and the witnesses' testimony. The court held that the fingerprint evidence was properly admitted. Defendant's Fourth Amendment right against unwarranted seizure was not violated because the affidavit established the necessary probable cause to believe that he had burglarized the store. Sufficient evidence also existed to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed. Noting that the school district was under a court order to desegregate and that it had a policy imposing affirmative obligations on teachers to exhibit sensitivity for others, the court held that it was immoral for a teacher to teach white students that it was all right to engage in conduct that was humiliating, painful, and harmful to individuals, which subjected a class of people to public disdain and ridicule, and which was in violation of board rules adopted for the purpose of putting an end to racial discrimination. The court held that in order for a teacher's conduct to be immoral within &sect; 79-1260, such conduct must have been directly related to a teacher's ability to teach, and indicate an unfitness to do so.</SPAN></P>

The district court thereafter sentenced defendant to one year at hard labor and imposed a fine. The conviction arose after evidence was presented that defendant, a part-time jailer, had sexual relations with an inmate, the prosecutrix, at the jail. On appeal, defendant alleged that the district court erred in failing to grant a mistrial after a witness for the prosecution made reference to a polygraph test, that the district court erred in precluding the use of prior juvenile convictions of the prosecutrix for impeachment purposes, and that the sentence imposed was excessive. The court affirmed, holding that the reference to the polygraph test was not prejudicial to defendant, and that there was no error in preclusion of the prior juvenile convictions of the prosecutrix because the only use of such evidence was to show that the prosecutrix was dishonest, which was an improper use under the rules of evidence.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-347 (Cum. Supp. 1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physicians and pregnant minors filed a suit against the officials, challenging the constitutionality of Nebraska's parental notification statute,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-347. The district court certified the questions to the court. The court entered a judgment on the questions. Once a judge found the minor was mature enough or that notice to her parents would not be in her best interests, the judge had to waive the notice requirements of &sect; 238-347(1). Because the abortions were to be performed in Nebraska, Nebraska law controlled as to the age of majority for purposes of the statute. A physician's good faith belief as to the minor's age was not a defense under &sect; 28-347(1). Before a minor could pursue an action under &sect; 28-347(2) under a fictitious name, she had to receive approval from the relevant court. The minor could present evidence, and the judge would make a decision as to her maturity. Because there was no adversarial aspect to the proceedings, no minor, indigent or otherwise, was entitled to free court-appointed counsel as a matter of right in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court noted that the plan for a third person live-in caretaker was no more than a temporary foster care arrangement, which was subject to abrupt change, that such changes would have been psychologically damaging to the child, and that a caretaker could not have corrected the parents' mental deficiencies. The court determined that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-209(5), which prescribed the conditions under which parental rights may have been terminated, was sufficiently definite that it did not run afoul of vagueness standards. The court explained that &sect; 43-209(5) was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it provided adequate standards, which people of ordinary intelligence could have understand and by which they could have regulated their conduct so as to avoid termination. The court noted that the parents were unable to discharge their parental responsibilities because of their mental illnesses, so it did not matter whether the illness manifested itself otherwise, so long as they were unable to discharge their parental duties. The court concluded that the evidence clearly and convincingly established that the parents were incapable of caring for the child.</SPAN></P>

The police officer prosecuted an appeal to the personnel board of defendant city. The board denied the appeal. An error proceeding was then brought in the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which affirmed the decision of the board. The police officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer contended that the district court erred in holding that the board acted consistently with the law and in failing to find that certain police regulations were unconstitutional. The police officer also argued that the district court's decision was contrary to law and not supported by the evidence. The court rejected the police officer's arguments and affirmed the district court's order. The court found that the police officer was appropriately advised of the charges before the board hearing and fully understood the reasons for his dismissal. The court held that the challenged police regulations were constitutional because language used therein was plain and clear and sufficiently conveyed definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. Finally, the court found evidence in the record showing the police officer's involvement in the fraud. The court noted that dismissal of the criminal charges against the police officer did not permit the court to say as a matter of law that the original charges and bindover were frivolous and wholly without foundation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the State charged defendant with violating Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-611(1), a felony charge.

The second amended information charged defendant with a violation of &sect; 28-611(3), a class II misdemeanor. The trial court granted the State's motion to withdraw the second amended information. On appeal, the court held that it was uncertain from the record whether the trial court thought that it was trying defendant under the original information charging a violation of &sect; 28-611(1) and that &sect; 28-611(3) was a lesser-included offense thereof, or whether it was trying defendant under an information charging a violation of &sect; 28-611(3), as the State contended.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree murder. The court affirmed. Defendant engaged in a series of acts directed at bringing about a murder. The acts were corroborative of his criminal intent. Defendant made plans for the murder, solicited a killer, discussed the contract price and set the money aside in his billfold, arranged for a weapon and a scope, and showed the killer the victim, his residence, and his place of work. The court held that these acts were substantial steps that sustained the conviction. Two tapes were admitted in their entirety. The third tape dealt with a different conversation on a different date. The State and defendant were required to prove the conversation by oral testimony. The court held that defendant was not placed at a disadvantage because the third tape could not be found. The crime was to be committed in Nebraska and substantial steps to complete the crime had been taken in Nebraska. One act committed in Iowa did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. Since the tape was made available for the jury, the court held that there was no prejudice to defendant. There was no evidence that the State acted in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers' positions were eliminated in a merger of schools, and the teachers were granted rights of re-employment under Neb.

The teachers filed a complaint against the school district alleging that the teachers had been deprived of their rights of re-employment under &sect; 79-1254.07 when they were not offered positions. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the teachers. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision as to one employee, and the court reversed the decision of the trial court for the second employee and remanded the case with directions to dismiss the claim of the second employee. The court found that the second teacher was not entitled to recover because the second teacher was a probationary teacher that had no rights of re-employment based on Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-1254. The court held that &sect; 79-1254 was sufficiently clear and certain, so the school district's argument alleging that &sect; 79-1254 was unconstitutionally vague was rejected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the court had held that underground water was not an article of commerce in the State of Nebraska, was the subject of public ownership, and thus regulations governing the use of such water, as well as prohibiting its export to non-reciprocating states, did not violate the commerce clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. While declaring that the court's holding was erroneous to the extent that it found underground water was not an article of commerce, the U.S. Supreme Court did not declare illegal the statutory scheme for conservation and preservation of ground water. On remand, the court determined purely as a matter of state law that the invalidated portion of &sect; 46-613.01 was severable. The court applied a four-pronged test and determined that the striking of the provision prohibiting transfer of water to non-reciprocating states did not weaken or otherwise impair the operation of the act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was not responsible because of insanity due to years of alcohol abuse and depression. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentence. The court held that statements defendant made to the police were admissible because they had been, respectively, volunteered by defendant, uttered in response to a neutral question, or uttered after defendant waived his right to have counsel present. The court also held that defendant's intoxication did not prevent his understanding his Miranda warning. The court found a jury instruction on an intoxication defense over defendant's objection was proper. The court stated that a trial court had a duty to instruct the jury on the law even if not requested to do so. The court held that defendant had understood the wrongful nature of his act, had planned it in advance, and was later able to recall what he had done. Thus, the state had proven the requisite mental state for a conviction of murder under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-303 (Reissue 1979).

The court affirmed in part and remanded in part for resentencing. The court affirmed the conviction and found that the court did not err in allowing the admission of evidence that had been seized and removed from defendant's car. The court reasoned that when the police arrived the articles were already removed from defendant's car, the keys were in the possession of a third party who had control of the car and he showed the articles to the police, and the articles were in plain view. Therefore, the search was legal and justified. The court found that the lower court erred in the sentencing of defendant. The court stated that defendant's immunity testimony or any information directly or indirectly derived from the immunity testimony in a previous criminal case could not be considered in determining whether a death sentence should be imposed under the provisions of Neb.

He argued, among other things, that 1) the evidence was insufficient to establish the crime; 2) the trial court erred in failing to define the elements of criminal conspiracy; and 3) the trial court erred in submitting alleged overt acts to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant asked a friend for the name of a person who would contract to kill his wife. The friend feigned agreement, and a state agent played the part of a hit man. The jury found defendant guilty under &sect; 28-202, and the court affirmed. The court found that the evidence showed defendant and his friend entered into an agreement, which defendant understood as an agreement to solicit a hit man to kill his wife. Further, the court determined that &sect; 28-202 adopted the unilateral approach, which allowed the conviction even where defendant's friend was pretending to conspire. Moreover, the trial court correctly submitted the alleged overt acts to the jury based on defendant's action, including the meetings with the alleged hit man, furnishing of the wife's itinerary, a description of her car, and her physical description.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the substations, except the high voltage buses thereon, were a part of the distribution system within the territorial limits of the city and quieted title in the city to the substations. It was a function of the legislature to decide questions of public policy related to the government of public power districts. The court's only function was to determine whether the laws were complied with. The evidence showed that stepdown substations could be operated as either part of the transmission or distribution system. On appeal, the court reversed. The equipment of the substations on the low voltage side was the city's property, and the superstructure and all equipment on the high voltage side of the substation, were the property of the power district. Since both parties must have access to each substation for maintenance and to protect its facilities, the court directed that title to the real estate be quieted in the power district and that the city be granted an easement of ingress and egress so long as the sites were used for the present purposes.</SPAN></P>

Title to the real estate was to be quieted in the power district and the city granted an easement of ingress and egress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' son allegedly set fire to the property owner's building. The property owner filed an action to recover damages from the parents, alleging in the first cause of action that the parents were liable for the willful and intentional acts of their son under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-801 (Reissue 1978). The second cause of action alleged that the parents were negligent in the supervision of their son. The trial court sustained the parents' demurrer to the first cause of action and dismissed it. The second cause of action remained viable. The court dismissed the property owner's appeal of the trial court's order. The property owner's appeal was premature because the trial court's order was not a final order under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-1911 (Reissue 1979) because the substantial rights of the parties in the action remained undetermined and the cause was retained for further action. The court held that an order dismissing one cause of action while another cause of action arising out of the same factual circumstances and involving the same parties but asserting a different legal theory of recovery remained pending for trial did not constitute a final appealable order.</SPAN></P>

Fourteen years later, the patient discovered that she had breast cancer, which she claimed was caused by the doctor's asthma treatments. The trial court found that the patient's action was untimely as it was brought more than ten years after the last date that the doctor rendered professional service to the patient. The patient argued that the 10-year period of repose did not apply and that, even if it did apply, it was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the repose portion of &sect; 25-222 contained a reasonable classification of persons and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court ruled that the requirement of Neb. Const. art I, &sect; 13 that all courts be open and every person have a remedy by due process of law for any injury to his person, did not mean that limits could not be imposed upon the time within which one must ask courts to act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute required the division of metropolitan class cities into districts with a commissioner elected from each district. The citizen asserted that the statute addressed a matter of local concern and that its provisions were directly in conflict with the city of Omaha's home rule charter, in violation of Neb. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5. The trial court determined that the statute did not violate the state constitution and the court affirmed. The statute was enacted in an attempt to assure proportionate representation in cities of a certain size. This was a statewide rather than local concern, and therefore, the statute took precedence over any conflicting portions of home rule charters. Further, the provision calling for district elections was not special or local legislation that violated Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18 because a reasonable distinction existed between the commission form of government, which was allowed to conduct at-large elections, and all other forms of government available to metropolitan class cities. Finally, although the trial court's opinion contained a misstatement as to the scope of the statute, its ultimate finding was correct and would not be overturned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retirees challenged a judgment from the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which sustained the motion of defendants, Nebraska State Patrolmen's Retirement System and Public Employees Retirement Board, for summary judgment and dismissed the retirees' petition. The case involved only the rights of retiring patrolmen who were members of the System on or before January 4, 1979.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees sought a declaratory judgment that the final average monthly salary of retiring patrolmen should include the lump sum payment for accumulated but unused vacation and sick leave. Until January 4, 1979, salary was calculated that way, but after that date the lump sum was excluded. The trial court concluded that the policy of including the lump sum did not create contractual rights in those who served while the policy was in effect. On review, the court disagreed, stating that because Nebraska law recognized that public pensions were deferred compensation, State employees had reasonable expectations protected by contract law regarding their pension rights. The court held that to the extent that the Lickert opinion conflicted, it was overruled. The court found evidence that the retirees relied on the lump sum as an incentive to enter and remain in the State Patrol. The court concluded that the Board's practice of including the payments gave rise to legitimate expectations, that the retirees had a vested right to have the practice continued as to them, and that discontinuation unconstitutionally impaired vested contractual rights, entitling them to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had sustained defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the retirees' petition, and remanded with directions to enter a judgment conforming to the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Lincoln Municipal Code &sect; 9.52.100, which made it unlawful for anyone to commit any indecent, immodest, or filthy act. Defendant was observed standing in front of his apartment window in the nude. On appeal, defendant argued that nudity, per se, was not obscene and was a form of free expression guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The court found that it need not decide whether nudity was constitutionally guaranteed because the court found the statute, as drafted, was so vague as to be unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the statute was so vague as to make a person of common intelligence guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application. The court found that the fact that an act was immodest did not necessarily make it illegal, and reversed and dismissed defendant's conviction under &sect; 9.52.100.</SPAN></P>

Initially, the court held that there was sufficient probable cause to believe that defendant committed the assault by virtue of the victim's identification of defendant and of the place where the assault occurred, and by information from an informant and a medical examination. However, an opinion issued during the pendency of defendant's appeal provided that a police officer with no arrest or search warrant could not make a valid nonconsensual and warrantless entry into a suspect's home without exigent circumstances. Because the court uniformly applied that opinion in all cases that were pending on appeal when it was released, the opinion applied to defendant's case. Finally, the court held that defendant's arrest took place in his home because defendant was standing inside his doorway when the arrest was made. That arrest was illegal because there was no warrant, no consent, and no exigent circumstances; as such, defendant's custodial statements should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The referee appointed by the court found that he violated the code and recommended suspension. The attorney filed exceptions to the report. The court affirmed the findings of violations, but rejected the recommendation of suspension and imposed disbarment. The attorney was free to criticize state laws, the actions of prosecutors, and a court's view of the law because such statements would not impugn the integrity of the judicial system. However, obedience to ethical precepts required the attorney to abstain from what in other circumstances might be constitutionally protected speech. Discipline was imposed because the attorney's derogatory factual allegations with regard to other attorneys and courts were false and he should have known they were false. The court found that due to his lack of remorse, failure to change his attitude, and his lack of desire to cease his scurrilous attacks on the bench and bar, a sanction of suspension was too lenient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought review of an order from the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which, in an action against respondent city, its mayor, the members of its city council, and a neighborhood corporation, held that the landowner was not a person aggrieved within the meaning of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-1201 (Reissue 1977) and that he did not have standing to sue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner claimed that the decision of the city council would cause undue hardship if his shopping center was allowed to be built on the rezoned tract in close proximity to the landowner's proposed shopping center site. The district court also found that even if the landowner had standing to sue, he failed to prove he suffered some special injury peculiar to himself as required by law. On review the court found no error. The enactment of a zoning ordinance by a municipal governing body was an exercise of legislative authority from which no direct appeal lay. An appeal or error proceeding did not lie from a purely legislative act by a public body to which legislative authority had been delegated. The only remedy in such cases was by collateral attack, that is, by injunction or other suitable actions. The court held that, in order to have standing as an aggrieved person for the purpose of attacking a change of zone, the landowner had to demonstrate that he suffered a special injury that was different in kind from that suffered by the general public. The possibility that zone changes might afford competition for businesses was not sufficient to give standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to a statutory merger with another natural resources district, three members of the seller's board of supervisors met and, with one member abstaining, conveyed the property to the buyers as trustees of a private conservation trust. After the merger, all five members of the board met and purported to approve the transfer, although the district was no longer in existence. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the transfer was void. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-1519 (Reissue 1974), which provided that the concurrence of a majority of the supervisors was required for the determination of any matter within their duties, referred to a majority of all the members of the board of supervisors, not to a majority of a quorum. Abstentions could not be counted as affirmative votes; hence, there was no majority. The suit to quiet title was commenced within the applicable 10-year limitations period of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-202 (Reissue 1979). Although the limitations period for a constructive trust was only four years under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-207 (Reissue 1979), the court held that the statute did not begin to run until the successor district learned of the conveyance.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and the death sentence. The court rejected defendant's contention that the death penalty was per se unconstitutional. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 29-2519 - 29-2523 (Reissue 1979) were unconstitutional because they did not provide for a jury determination of the existence of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the appropriateness of the death penalty. The court held that jury sentencing was not constitutionally required. The court also found that the definitions of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2523 et seq. were not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. Further, the sentencing panel properly applied the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court also held that the supreme court review required by 1978 Neb. Laws 711 was properly limited to cases in which defendants were found guilty of first degree murder and the death penalty was imposed. The court concluded that a broader application would improperly require the supreme court to engage in executive functions.</SPAN></P>

The issue raised was whether appellants' right to due process was violated by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-209(5) (Reissue 1978). The court found that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-209(5) (Reissue 1978) protected a compelling state interest and was thus not unconstitutional. The court held that the record was clear that the juvenile court terminated appellants' parental rights only as a last resort to protect the best interests of the minor children. In support, the court held that the record evidenced that appellants were unable to master even the most basic skills of diapering and feeding the children. It was reasoned that the evidence also demonstrated that in all probability appellants' mental problems would have continued for a prolonged and indefinite period and that it was unlikely that they would have ever been able to regain custody of their children. Thus, the court found no evidence in the record, which indicated that it would have been in the best interests of the minor children to allow appellants to maintain a &quot;residue of visitation rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-912 (Reissue 1979) and also convicted him on a habitual criminal charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his acquaintance were shown a drawing of a criminal suspect by a police officer. When defendant reached for the drawing, the police officer observed forearm markings similar to the suspect. The police officer told defendant that he was under arrest. Defendant struck the police officer and ran away, but surrendered about two blocks away. Defendant contended that he was not under arrest when he ran away and that the district court's jury instruction defining arrest should have indicated that mere words were not enough to constitute an arrest. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that constructive restraint existed. Under the evidence, the district court did not err in refusing to include the phrase that mere words were not enough in the jury instruction defining arrest. The court held that the prosecution's references to the fact that defendant was under arrest for a felony were proper because being under detention for a felony was an element of the crime charged and, therefore, was relevant and material. The district court did not err in refusing to include an instruction on the lesser-included offense of resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the employee was a farm laborer but that the worker's compensation law did not violate equal protection laws. The court noted that farm laborers were excluded from the Act, but that treatment of that classification as &quot;nonhazardous&quot; was not unreasonable on the part of the legislature. The court concluded that the employee did not meet his burden of proof to show that there was no rational basis for the exclusion of farm labor employers, so he did not overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether the franchisor exercised its judgment actually and honestly when it gave appellees &quot;first consideration&quot; as defined by the partial summary judgment order.

The franchisor's only obligation under the &quot;first consideration&quot; clause was to consider the franchisees for a furtherance of its franchise relationship prior to considering any other prospective franchisee for those locations. It had a duty to carry out this obligation in good faith, defined as honestly and actually, and not captiously or capriciously. The franchisor carried out this obligation when it met to determine whether or not it wished to continue a franchise relationship with the franchisees.</SPAN></P>

Neither the landowners nor their predecessor in title applied for a permit to transport ground water as required by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-613.01 (Reissue 1978). The trial court granted the State's request for an injunction after deciding that &sect; 46.613.01 did not violate the commerce clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because under Nebraska law water was not an article of commerce. The court held that water was a unique commodity subject to state regulation to assure that it was available to everyone in the state in relation to their need, rather than their ability to pay for it. Ground water was not an unlimited private property right. The court agreed with the trial court and concluded that Nebraska ground water was not an article of commerce and thus was not subject to the strictures of the commerce clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter before the court was a proceeding to terminate the parental rights of an unmarried father. The child's mother had called the police to take her children away because she was about to have a nervous breakdown. Douglas County Social Services was given custody of the child. The father sought to obtain custody once he was gainfully employed. The State established that the father had failed to pay child support or participate in parenting classes. The trial court terminated the parental rights of the father. The father contended that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-209(6) was unconstitutionally vague. The father argued that parental rights could be terminated only upon presentation of clear and convincing evidence that he was unfit. On appeal, the court stated that where a statute clearly applied to someone, he could not successfully challenge it for vagueness. The court held the evidence was clear and convincing that the trial court had not abused its discretion in entering its order terminating the parental rights of the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to death. His codefendant was convicted for his role of aiding and abetting the murder, and was sentenced to life. At a hearing on defendant's post conviction motion to vacate his conviction and sentence, the codefendant testified that he had actually killed the victim. The trial court denied defendant's motion. On appeal, defendant argued ineffective assistance of counsel, failure to apply Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2522 (1979), as amended by 1978 Neb. Laws, L.B. 711, and other grounds. Affirming the trial court's denial of defendant's motion, the court held that the record, which did not corroborate the codefendant's confession and which included evidence that defendant admitted killing the victim, supported the finding that defendant committed felony murder. Further, 1978 Neb. Laws, L.B. 711 was effective after defendant's conviction, and therefore could not be applied to defendant's case. Finally, the trial court's finding that defendant did not prove that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel's representation was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The state law was changed, and a petition was filed with the Board of Mental Health requesting involuntary commitment treatment. The trial court granted the petition. The mentally ill person sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) there was sufficient evidence to support he conclusion reached by the Board that the mentally ill person was a mentally ill dangerous person; (2) proof of acts committed more than five years prior to the filing of the mental health proceedings did not contravene the mentally ill person's due process and equal protection guarantees because there was sufficient evidence that the acts were still probative of the mentally ill person's present state of dangerousness; and (3) although the Board erred in failing to first make the determination that the mentally ill person was mentally ill and dangerous, he was not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

The church also argued that forcing the church to comply with state school laws violated the constitutional rights of the church and the parents who schooled their children there. The court rejected the church's procedural argument against the appropriateness of the injunctive relief. The court noted that injunctive relief could be awarded against persistent violations of the law even though they were subject to criminal prosecution. The court found fault with the church's interpretation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 79-312(6), 79-1247.03 and held that the state had not violated the sections. The court rejected the church's constitutional argument that parents' Ninth Amendment rights to school their children as they saw fit and First Amendment protection for freedom of religion would be violated by forcing the church to comply. The court reasoned that parents had a right to send their children to schools other than public institutions, but did not have the right to be completely unfettered by reasonable government regulations as to the quality of the education furnished.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The state system of selecting jurors by the use of voter registration lists was constitutionally permissible. The prosecution's opening statement, that it expected the evidence to show that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, was not an expression of a personal belief or opinion as to defendant's guilt. The victim's testimony did not have to be independently corroborated on the particular acts that constituted the sexual assault, but had to be corroborated on the material facts and circumstances that support his testimony about the principal fact in issue, which was the use of force.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees contended that the 1979 amendment to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-146 was unconstitutional because (1) it discriminated against licensees who did not own a building in which bingo occasions could be held; (2) it impaired the obligation of contracts and vested rights; (3) it amended by implication statutory provisions regarding licenses, in violation of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 14; and (4) it stifled a legitimate business by creating an arbitrary and unreasonable trade barrier. The court held that although the change in the statute would place a hardship on smaller nonprofit organizations, some of which might experience difficulty in finding suitable locations and obtaining the equipment required in order for them to conduct bingo games, this circumstance was not so unreasonable as to make the amendment invalid. The court further held that the licenses which the licensees held were not contracts and were subject to whatever reasonable regulation the legislature imposed from time to time. Therefore, the court affirmed the dismissal of the action because the licensee's were not entitled to a declaration that the 1979 amendment to &sect; 9-146 was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger was riding on the back of a motorcycle operated by the driver when they approached a stop sign. The passenger yelled to the driver to stop, but the driver proceeded through the intersection and collided with another vehicle. The passenger was injured and he filed his action against the driver. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' action at the close of their case. Plaintiffs appealed. The court declined to consider the constitutionality of the State's guest statute, which it had ruled on in the past. The court ruled that the trial court erred when it ruled as a matter of law that the driver had not been grossly negligent. There was sufficient evidence on the issue to send it to the jury. The trial court also erred when it ruled that plaintiffs failed, as a matter of law, to prove that the driver was operating the motorcycle with the permission of his father, who owned it. That question too should have gone to the jury. The court declined to rule on the issue of negligent entrustment in the light of its earlier ruling concerning the State's guest statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of displaying a mechanical amusement device for public use without a permit or allowing the use of such a device without the name and address of the owner affixed to the machine. The lower court affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed in part, holding that the prosecution did not have to be against the corporation that operated the premises because the ordinances applied to any person who permitted the machines to be displayed for public use. The court held that defendant was not denied a speedy trial because, after excluding the periods of time not chargeable to the state, the record showed defendant was tried within the six-month period prescribed by statute. The court reversed in part, dismissing the action based on the search warrant of November 5, 1976 because in a prior proceeding it was found that the premises were not open to the public at that time.</SPAN></P>

The owners questioned the constitutionality of the ordinance which they contended violated Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sought review of the trial court's judgment finding that the disputed local ordinance was constitutionally valid. The owners contended that defendants had refused to review the owners' building plans because the owners had not dedicated a segment of their land for the development of a right-of-way for a proposed road construction project as provided in Ord. 1962. The city asserted that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of its police power intended to promote the public safety and welfare, allowing it to require the dedication of streets as a condition for approving subdivision development. The court on appeal reversed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that, because no street development project was immediately contemplated, the court viewed the city's land acquisition pursuant to Ord. 1962 to be clearly in violation of Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court determined that the city could not, under the guise of its police power, require the property owners to dedicate property for some future public purpose as a condition for obtaining a building permit without the city paying the owners just compensation. The court declared Ord. 1962 invalid.</SPAN></P>

Upon appellate review, the court affirmed the denial. The court held that the DPW denial was supported by competent, material, and relevant evidence. The court held that because plaintiff's parents were not residents of Nebraska, and plaintiff was mentally incapable of forming the intent to change her domicile, she was not a resident of Nebraska.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant school district sought review of a decision of the District Court, Keya Paha County (Nebraska), which entered a judgment against it and ordered it to pay plaintiff parent a portion of the amount paid by the parent to a different school district as tuition for his two children. The school district claimed that the district court erred in finding that the State Board of Education had authority to order payment of the tuition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent lived in the extreme northeast corner of the boundary of the school district. When weather was bad, a total of 75 miles one way had to be traveled for his children to get to school. The parent made application, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-1103.05 (Reissue 1976), to the school district to have the school district pay the tuition for his children at a different school. The school district rejected the application. The Board entered an order for the school district to pay 75 percent of the tuition. The school district did not pay the parent and he instituted the action in district court. The court affirmed. The Board's hearing appeals as provided for in &sect; 79-1103.05(2) was a quasi-judicial function and either party had the right to appeal to the district court. The school district took no steps to appeal the Board's order and could not collaterally attack the order. Not having been appealed, the order of the Board for the school district to pay 75 percent of the tuition was a final order and could not be relitigated in the parent's suit to collect under that order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned several tracts of land that the State took in a condemnation proceeding for a highway. The landowner was originally awarded over $ 1,400 for the land taken by appraisers. He appealed the appraiser's award to the district court, and the award was reduced to $ 12,650. The landowner, after accepting payment for the land, brought a declaratory judgment action that excess land was taken in the eminent domain proceeding. The district court dismissed the matter on statute of limitations grounds, and on appeal, the court affirmed on other grounds. The action to reclaim previously condemned land was barred as a matter of res judicata because the question of the necessity of the taking for the use intended should have been raised in the eminent domain proceeding. The landowner, having failed to raise the issue in that proceeding, could not raise it in the subsequent declaratory judgment proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had a seventh grade education and a low I.Q., and the mother had an eighth grade education and was working toward earning her GED when they filed for divorce.

After an instance where the child was left unattended, she was placed in a foster home where her skills improved as to her personal hygiene and schoolwork. After application by the guardian ad litem of the parties' minor child, the trial court terminated their parental rights. The parties appealed, and the court held that &sect; 42-364 violated the Due Process Clause and was unconstitutional and void. The court concluded that &sect; 42-364 was vague and lacking in adequate and understandable standards of conduct to which parents were to conform so as not to risk termination of their rights.

He had been convicted on at least two prior occasions of offenses resulting in prison sentences of not less than one year, so a supplemental charge of being an habitual criminal in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2221 (1943) was added. At trial, defendant alleged the habitual criminal statute had been selectively enforced against him and other Native Americans in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Defendant was convicted of robbery and being an habitual criminal. He appealed only the habitual criminal charge. The court affirmed the conviction and held that defendant did not make a prima facie case of discriminatory prosecution when the statistical data he offered was simply too inconclusive to establish discrimination because it was based on only 26 people who could have been charged as habitual criminals. The court held that although statistics that show a racial imbalance could be a sign of purposeful discrimination, it must be shown that the figures were sufficiently representative as to be reliable.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 76-1601 to 76-1651 (Supp. 1978). The trial court determined that the Act was in all respects valid and not in violation of the Nebraska Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it: created a single public corporation by special law in violation of Neb. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1, granted the fund special privileges and immunities in violation of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, permitted the extension of credit of the State for a purely private purpose in violation of Neb. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3, permitted the issuance of revenue bonds in excess of $ 100,000 in violation of Neb. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1, permitted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the fund in violation of Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1; and, failed to effect a valid public purpose. The court disagreed and affirmed the validity and constitutionality of the Act. The court held that the Act was a general law, which created a governmental body for the purpose of addressing a serious shortage of adequate home financing for low and moderate income people, and that such declaration was a public purpose properly delegated. The court held that the fact that certain funds once obtained through bonds went to private lending institutions who in turn made the funds available for low and moderate income citizens did not change the public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The corporation did not request a permit for the erection of the sign or acquire one from the Department as required by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-1320 et seq. (Reissue 1943). Those statutes made it unlawful to place advertising signs along any interstate highway without a written permit from the Department. The act also contained exceptions for advertising signs lawfully erected or in existence prior to March 27, 1972, and authorized the Department to acquire or condemn interests in real or personal property necessary to exercise the power granted to it under the statutes.The Department had the right to apply for an injunction to enforce compliance with the statute. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) it did not matter whether the sign was erected prior to March 27, 1972, the corporation was not in compliance with the law; and (2) the Department had not yet &quot;taken&quot; the property.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's judgment granting the AG a permanent injunction enjoining the proprietor from engaging in deceptive trade practices and requiring her to file quarterly reports with the AG for four years. The court found the proprietor's method of advertising in the &quot;Help Wanted&quot; section was deceptive in that it led readers to believe paid employment was being offered when the proprietor was actually soliciting students for her modeling school. The court found the evidence was sufficient to support the granting of the permanent injunction despite the fact that the proprietor was not doing business at the time of the trial. Also, the court held that the requirement that the AG had cause to believe deceptive trade practices existed or had existed before instituting a suit was not an essential element of the action to be proved at trial.</SPAN></P>

The applicants alleged that their applications were rejected based on Reg.

The court on appeal reversed the judgment of the trial court based on its determination that Reg. IX-4731 was unconstitutional under both the United States and Nebraska Constitutions because the regulation established different classifications of needs for the unborn children. The regulation recognized the needs for financial assistance for a prospective unmarried mother who did not live in the home of her parents or was at least 19 years of age, but determined that an unborn child of a prospective unmarried mother who lived in the home of her parents has no need for financial assistance separate and apart from those of its mother and maternal grandparents.</SPAN></P>

Evidence presented by two medical witnesses clearly and convincingly established that the inmate &quot;mentally ill&quot; within the meaning of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83-1009 (Reissue 1978). Although the inmate might not have been suicidal in the true sense, he was capable of taking extreme steps which admittedly could have endangered his life or health. Looking at his entire psychiatric background it appeared obvious that he presented a potentially substantial risk of harm both to others and to himself. Several incidents were sufficiently recent to conform to the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that in turn affirmed the order of the county mental health board that committed the inmate for treatment as a mentally ill dangerous person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters in the school district defeated a proposition for the construction of a new school. The school board subsequently signed a contract for the purchase of land and a contract for architectural services for the design grading, draining, and location of facilities for a running track and football field on the site. The architect's fees were paid from a special fund established pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-548.01 (Reissue 1943). The taxpayers filed an action to declare the land purchase contract void, and to prohibit the expenditure of funds from the special fund. The trial court invalidated the land purchase agreement but ruled that the school district could use funds accumulated in the special funds for an athletic field. The taxpayers claimed on appeal that &sect; 79-548.01 unlawfully delegated authority to the school district to tax. The court rejected the taxpayer's claim. The court ruled that the school district, as a creation of the legislature, was authorized to levy taxes for education.

The applicant alleged that the regulations requiring correctable 20/20 vision were unconstitutional and should have been declared void and unenforceable. The trial court entered orders denying the injunction and dismissed the applicant's petitions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the standards involved in this case were directly related to the health and safety of the firemen and the public, and hence were a proper exercise of the police power of the state, and were not violative of any rights under the state or federal constitutions. The court held that applicant failed to sustain his burden to establish the invalidity or unconstitutionality of the standards. The court held that the evidence clearly established that a visual impediment in a firefighter was not &quot;unrelated&quot; to a person's ability to engage in his occupation, even though his visual acuity might possibly have been corrected by the wearing of glasses for ordinary purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, appellant district residents sought review of the judgment of the District Court for Howard County (Nebraska), which upheld two contracts entered into by appellees, reclamation district and irrigation district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts, which were subdivisions of the state, were organized to irrigate land. At trial, the validity of the contracts entered into by the districts was upheld. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the contract entered into by the reclamation district with the United States was improperly upheld by the trial court. Although the trial court was not required to pass on the feasibility of the project or consider whether there was enough water, the reclamation district exceeded its authority under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-564 (Reissue 1943). Section 46-564 was a limitation on indebtedness and under that statute, the contract was prohibited absent voter approval. The irrigation district's contract with the United States was authorized under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-156(1) (Reissue 1943); however, the irrigation district's contract with the reclamation district was void under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-1,145 because a prior election had not been held. Finally, the trial court was correct in denying the residents' petition for class status because a real and substantial conflict was apparent within the members of the stated class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the District Court for Scotts Bluff County (Nebraska), which entered judgment convicting him of violating Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1033 (1943). Defendant contended that &sect; 28-1033 was unconstitutionally overbroad, vague, and indefinite, and that his conviction was barred by the principle of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the victim was shot and killed in Wyoming, defendant loaded the body into the trunk of a car, drove to the car a ditch in Nebraska, then rode back home in another car with his wife. He was charged with murder in Wyoming but was found not guilty. Nebraska authorities then charged him with violating &sect; 28-1033 by unlawfully and feloniously throwing away or abandoning a dead human body in a place other than a regular place for burial and without the issuance of a proper death certificate. The trial court entered judgment convicting defendant and overruled his motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the contention that &sect; 28-1033 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, explaining that the terms &quot;dead human body or any portion thereof,&quot; &quot;regular place for burial,&quot; and &quot;proper death certificate contained in &sect; 28-1033 were words of common usage which did not require definition and that defendant had fair notice that his actions were prohibited under the statute. The court also held that double jeopardy did not bar defendant's prosecution because the same evidence would not have resulted in convictions for both murder and abandoning a dead body.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 57-228 through 57-231 (1943) (act), to extinguish the severed mineral interests of the purchasers. The purchasers claimed the retroactive application of the act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grantor executed a mineral deed to the grantee, which conveyed an undivided on-half interest in and to all oil, gas, and minerals that could be produced from the land. The deed warranted the title of the estate forever to the grantee, his heirs, and successors. The grantee then executed and delivered mineral deeds for fractional interests to the purchasers. The successors later acquired title to the surface and one-half of the oil, gas, and minerals in different tracts of real estate from the original grantor. The successors brought actions under the act to extinguish the severed mineral interests owned of record by the purchasers. The trial court canceled the interests and vested title in the successors. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the act was intended to apply retrospectively because it allowed actions to be filed immediately after its effective date. The court held that the statute's attempt to operate retroactively was unconstitutional as violative of the due process and contract clauses of the United States and the Nebraska Constitutions. The statute deprived known property owners of their subsurface rights without notice, hearing, or compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which was in favor of the successors, and found for the purchasers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which convicted him of one count of burglary and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon, and adjudged him to be an habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After escaping from prison, defendant was permitted to stay in the basement of a house of another man. The man and defendant committed the burglary for which he was charged. The police received a tip as to where defendant was staying and came to the house without either an arrest or search warrant. Defendant was found hiding in the house and was arrested. The man gave the police permission to search the house where they found a gun in the pocket of defendant's jacket. They also found a shotgun and the stolen rifle in the basement. On appeal defendant argued that this evidence should have been suppressed. The court had to first consider whether the issue had been properly preserved for review. At issue was whether, after denial of the motion to suppress, it was necessary to move to suppress again or object to the admission of the evidence at trial. The court ruled that reassertion of the objection was not necessary. Since defendant had timely filed a motion for a new trial, the issue was properly preserved. The court then found that the man who had control of the house could consent to the search and that there was ample evidence to convict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner wife and respondent husband sought review after the District Court for Sarpy County (Nebraska) entered a divorce decree and awarded attorney fees pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-341 and 42-366 (Reissue 1943). The husband, an attorney, had obtained a divorce in the Dominican Republic and drafted the property settlement, which awarded the wife, who had no attorney, a small portion of the $ 400,000 to $ 450,000 marital estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After consulting an attorney, the wife filed this divorce action on the ground that the marriage was irretrievably broken. She sought an award of alimony and an equitable distribution of property acquired during the marriage. The husband appeared specially, objecting to the jurisdiction of the court on the grounds that the parties had been divorced in the Dominican Republic and that they had executed a valid property settlement in conjunction with the foreign divorce. The trial court refused to recognize the foreign divorce decree and concluded that the property settlement executed by the parties in conjunction with that decree was not binding on the wife because it was unconscionable. The trial court dissolved the marriage and divided the property, giving the wife about 45 percent of the assets. The court modified and affirmed. The trial court did not err by failing to recognize the foreign divorce decree. Section 42-341 prohibited it when the parties were domiciled in Nebraska. The property settlement was unconscionable. Sections 42-341 and 42-366 were not unconstitutional, and the trial court's property settlement was fair. The court increased the fees awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the divorce decree by increasing the fees awarded to the wife's attorney and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He sued, contending that the tax system adopted, distinguishing blood relatives from non-blood relatives, was unconstitutional. He lost before the trial court, and he appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the legislature had substantial discretion in establishing tax rates, and the distinction between blood relatives and non-blood relatives was not utterly irrational.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while under the influence of alcoholic liquor and resisting arrest. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress the results of the breathalyzer test on the ground that it was obtained as a consequence of an illegal arrest and unconstitutional search and seizure. The jury acquitted defendant of resisting arrest, but found him guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the trial court did not err in failing to suppress the breathalyzer test results because officers were authorized to enter defendant's home and make a warrantless arrest under exigent circumstances of hot pursuit where a valid police action was commenced in a public place and defendant could not thwart the arrest by fleeing into a private placeand (2) the record of the two prior convictions for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol was not insufficient to substantiate a conviction for a third offense because defendant did not object to the exhibits sustaining the previous convictions and their alleged insufficiency was not assigned as error in defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83-1059 (1943), which prescribed the rules of evidence applicable to preliminary and final hearings and judicial hearings under the Nebraska Mental Health Commitment Act, did not mandate that Miranda-type warnings precede a psychiatric interview. Although the patient had been receiving treatment since his commitment, the court found that his dangerous behavior was recent enough to merit continued commitment, even without a finding of noncooperation in treatment.

The court rejected defendant's contention that he was prejudiced by a comment made by the county attorney in front of the jury. The trial court's instruction to the jury mitigated the effect of the comment. The court also rejected defendant's claims regarding the sentencing panel's decision to impose the death penalty. There was no merit to defendant's argument that the death penalty should not be imposed in instances, such as in defendant's own case, where the conviction was supported solely by circumstantial evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condemner appealed the decision of the District Court for Gage County (Nebraska) that dismissed its action to condemn defendant condemnees' property, consisting of 320 acres of farmland, for the asserted public purpose of constructing, operating, and maintaining a detention type flood control dam. The dismissal was based on a finding that only 140.68 acres were required and that an easement, instead of a fee title, was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Failing in its attempt to acquire an easement of 140 acres needed for the dam, the condemner instituted the action to acquire fee title to the entire 320 acres possessed by the condemnees. The condemnees petitioned for relief alleging that the taking was not for a public purpose, and the trial court also found that the condemner could not justify taking the property by adopting a public purpose after the action was instituted. On appeal, the condemner argued that the excess land was being acquired for possible future public use, while the condemnees claimed that the land was not being acquired for any public purpose but was being acquired solely to produce a profit from selling it. In affirming the decision below, the court held that the condemner was not authorized by its eminent domain powers to condemn private property for public purposes on the possibility that it might be needed in the future. Instead, it was required to establish by the pleadings its right to exercise the power of eminent domain and it was required to allege the specific public purpose for which it sought the land. As the condemner failed to do so, the trial court's findings were substantiated by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision and affirmed the allowance of $ 1,500 to the condemnees as attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

The parents challenged the school district's termination of bus service and the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-490 (1943).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents filed a petition alleging that the school district illegally terminated school bus service to students residing in what was formerly another school district. The parents contended that, when the former school district was merged, there was an oral agreement that the school district would provide bus service to the students of the former school district and that such promise was a consideration in the merger. After a number of years, the school district terminated the bus service. The parents also challenged the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-490 (1943), asserting that the statute was contrary to public policy insofar as it provided mandatory payment of transportation allowances for students only to those students who resided beyond the four-mile radius of the schoolhouse in a school district. The court held that parol evidence could not be received to contradict or enlarge what was contained in the public record of the merger and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel could not be applied against the school district. The court also concluded that the four-mile rule in &sect; 79-490 (1943) was a reasonable classification and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the conversion protested by the landowners was not in violation of the zoning laws. The court also found that the conversion did not constitute spot zoning as contended by the landowners. The court further determined that the land in question was largely vacant, that the proposed change was not a radical change from the original use, and that there was evidence that development of the land as a single family district was questionable. The court affirmed the prior denial of the landowners' request to have the ordinance declared null and void.</SPAN></P>

The legislature was presumed to have acted within its constitutional power despite that its laws might result in some inequality. The statute was reasonably justified by the need for medical care. A committee's assessment of medical malpractice claims did not infringe on a victim's right to a jury trial, nor did the statute usurp judicial functions. The statute constitutionally distinguished between different tort actions because the classifications were reasonable and grounded on inherent differences in situations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of possession of burglary tools with the intent to use them to break and enter in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-534 (Reissue 1943). The trial court sentenced him to one to one and a half years in prison. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional, that an expert witness' testimony was prejudicial, and that his sentence was excessive. The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court first held that the statute was not vague or indefinite. It plainly established that the elements of the crime were the possession of instruments or tools suitable for breaking and entering with the intent to use them for a burglarious purpose. Next, the court held that the witness, a retired convicted burglar, was more than qualified as an expert to testify on the burglary tools. Finally, the court held that the sentence was within the statutory limits and was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The proposed unit included the full-time academic faculty of the University of Nebraska (Lincoln), the members of which held, or were eligible to hold, continuous appointments, including chairmen and directors of departments, but excluding persons holding a rank higher than a chairman or director of a department. The petition alleged that more than 30 percent of the employees of the proposed unit had signed appropriate authorization cards. The board denied the propriety of the proposed bargaining unit and alleged that the proper unit should have been a multi-campus unit sufficient in scope to cover all university employees holding academic rank. The board also alleged that chairmen and directors of departments should not have been included in any bargaining unit because they were supervisors and a part of management. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the considerations set forth in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-838(2) (Supp. 1974) were not exclusive.</SPAN></P>

The court found that while there may have been serious questions about the franchise termination portions of the act, that question was not before the court where the corporation, having invoked the jurisdiction of the Board, could not reserve the constitutional issue and proceed with the action. However, the court held that the decision of the Licensing Board was not supported by competent evidence because the corporation proved the dealer failed to discharge his obligations under the franchise agreement where he did not change his facilities to conduct a new car operation or materially increase his investment to do so, did not install an additional service stall, and never employed a new car salesman.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was enacted to ensure compliance with decisions of the United States Supreme Court relating to the one man, one vote principle. The court reversed the dismissal of the voter's petition challenging the city's redistricting without using the most recent federal census. The court held that &sect; 5-108 was mandatory, and not directory, and that the substantial equality of districts had to be ascertained by using the most recent federal census even if other methods were ostensibly rational. The court held that there were compelling reasons to support its holding, specifically, that the federal census was highly reliable and not influenced by local politics or prejudices. In addition, the federal census provides an objective standard by which the court could determine the measure of the equality of political districts. Finally, the language &quot;most recent federal census&quot; in &sect; 5-108 included a special census.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of city residents formed a nonprofit corporation, through which they commenced the operation of a lottery. The corporation's stated intention was to use its net proceeds for community betterment. The State and the county filed suit for a declaration that the lottery was unlawful and to enjoin the corporation from operating the lottery. The trial court granted declaratory and injunctive relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. With respect to the corporation's appeal, the court found that the corporation was not an organization whose &quot;primary activities&quot; were conducted for &quot;charitable and community betterment purposes,&quot; Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-964.03, because the only activity that it engaged in was the operation of a lottery. The court thus found that the corporation was prohibited from operating a lottery. As to the cross appeal, the court found that under &sect; 28-964.03 and Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 24, reasonable and necessary expenses incident to the operation of a lottery could be paid from lottery proceeds. The court also found that under art. III, &sect; 24, the term &quot;promoter&quot; applied only to the persons or organizations that were legally responsible for conducting the lottery.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) based on the totality of circumstances, defendant's confession was knowing and voluntary, and there was no requirement that a juvenile had to be warned that he could be prosecuted as an adult or that his parents be notified before his statement was obtained; (2) the district court did not abuse its discretion under Neb.

Defendant appealed his conviction and death sentence for six counts of murder in the first degree. The court affirmed because the trial court properly balanced the mitigating circumstances of defendant's intoxication and low intelligence and the aggravating circumstances that related to murder in the perpetration of a first-degree sexual assault, murder in an attempt to conceal the crime, and the exceptional depravity in the murder of the females. The court held that the sentencing procedure of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2519 et seq.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction.

The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in not granting his motion for a separate trial. Essentially, defendant argued that evidence admitted against a co-defendant would be hearsay against him. The court found that the only type of such evidence was conversation between the co-defendant and an airline employee pertaining to the pick up of the suitcase. The court found that the conversation was not hearsay, but pertained to one of the operative facts evidencing the commission of a crime. The court also found that the defendant's out-of-court statement concerning his innocence and the co-defendant's guilt was properly excluded from evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' signs were constructed on a base supported by two wheels rendering them of a mobile nature. Under the city's zoning ordinances, the signs were prohibited in all residential areas because they were too large, were lighted, and had insufficient ground clearance. The regulations of which the owners complained related to set-backs, ground clearance, lights, size, electrical connections, wind resistance, and lot-use restrictions in various zoning areas. The owners asserted that the ordinances were unconstitutional because they unduly restricted a legitimate business. The question on appeal was whether or not the city could have arbitrarily refused to act by ordinance to sanction the owners' new type business in proper zoning areas where other large commercial signs were permitted. On appeal, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The regulations appeared justifiable from the standpoint of preventing traffic hazards, restrictions of view, interference with residential comfort, fire hazards, and the safety of the citizenry. The ordinances were not unreasonable on their face and the owners failed to prove that they were, in fact, unreasonable or discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the Nebraska divorce laws did not discriminate against women. The trial court was permitted to award alimony to either party, based on their financial condition.
