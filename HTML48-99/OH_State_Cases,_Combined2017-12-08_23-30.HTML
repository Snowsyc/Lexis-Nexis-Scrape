The relevant facts which precipitated the instant action have been stipulated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1, 1979, property owners in an industrial-commercial area of Springfield Township, known as Gilchrist II, who desired their property be annexed to the city of Akron, filed a petition with the Summit County Council.  After extensive litigation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a public hearing, the annexation request was denied.  <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;The Gilchrist II petition was one of four annexation petitions previously considered by this court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Holcomb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Bd. of Commrs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> (1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 241 [16 O.O.3d 278]. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the Gilchrist II petitioners appealed the decision of the Summit County Council to the court of common pleas in accordance with the provisions of R.C. 307.56 and 2506.01.  That court concluded that council's decision denying the annexation was illegal, unreasonable, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arbitrary and against the manifest weight of reliable and probative evidence and, therefore, remanded the cause with instructions ordering the council to approve the petition and transmit all relevant annexation information to the clerk of the Akron City Council.  See R.C. 2506.04.  On May 4, 1982, relators appealed the order of the court of common pleas to the court of appeals.  Relators, however, failed to request the court of common pleas to stay its judgment pending appeal, pursuant to Civ. R. 62(B).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;In pertinent part, Civ. R. 62 provides: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(B) Stay upon appeal.  When an appeal is taken the appellant may obtain a stay of execution of a judgment or any proceedings to enforce a judgment by giving an adequate supersedeas bond.  The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal.  The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is approved by the court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(C) Stay in favor of the government.  When an appeal is taken by this state or political subdivision, or administrative agency of either, or by any officer thereof acting in his representative capacity and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond, obligation or other security shall be required from the appellant.&quot; </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Absent a stay, the annexation information was forwarded to the city clerk who, after waiting sixty days in accordance with the provisions of R.C. 709.04, presented the Gilchrist II petition to the Akron City Council on June 28, 1982, at which time council accepted the annexation under Ordinance No. 415-1982.  Pursuant to R.C. 709.10, the ordinance was to become effective July 28, 1982.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 9, 1982, nearly two weeks after the passage of the ordinance, relators filed a motion in the court of appeals requesting the issuance of a stay, pursuant to App. R. 7, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in an attempt to enjoin the clerk of city council from authenticating, certifying or forwarding, and the county auditor and county clerk from accepting, recording and filing, the annexation documents.  After conducting a hearing on the motion, the court of appeals declined to issue the stay on the basis that &quot;* * * there is at this time [July 26, 1982] no act or proceeding which may be stayed pending resolution of this appeal.&quot; <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">3&nbsp;In pertinent part, App. R. 7 (A) provides: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Application for a stay of the judgment or order of a trial court pending appeal, or for the determination of the amount of and the approval of a supersedeas bond, must ordinarily be made in the first instance in the trial court.  A motion for such relief or for an order suspending, modifying, restoring or granting an injunction during the pendency of an appeal may be made to the court of appeals or to a judge thereof, but, except in cases of injunction pending appeal, the motion shall show that application to the trial court for the relief sought is not practicable, or that the trial court has, by journal entry, denied an application, or failed to afford the relief which the applicant requested.  The motion shall also show the reasons for the relief requested and the facts relied upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute the motion shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements or copies thereof.  * * *&quot; </SPAN></P>

The annexation was denied, but the order was challenged in the court of appeals and relators failed to request the court of common pleas to stay its judgment pending appeal under Ohio R. Civ. P. 62(B). Absent a stay, the annexation information was forwarded to the city clerk as required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.04, a petition was presented, and the council accepted the annexation under an ordinance. Two weeks after the ordinance passage, a motion for a stay was requested and denied. The mandamus action began. The court denied the writ. Relators wrongly argued that the court of appeals constructed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.07 as the sole avenue by which to preserve their appeal and that the construction denied relators an effective appeal. The court of common pleas properly held that because the city council passed the ordinance and the city officials had fully complied with Ohio Rev. Code ch. 709, there was no act or proceeding that remained to be stayed. Thus, the request for the stay was held moot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees own and operate a hazardous waste disposal facility in Jackson Township, Clermont County.  Appellee Clermont Environmental Reclamation Company acquired the site and operated it as a landfill prior to May 8, 1975.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, 1975, appellants, members of the Jackson Township Board of Trustees, adopted a zoning resolution for the township.  Section A, Article IV of that resolution prohibits privately owned and operated landfills in Jackson Township.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1979, appellants advised appellees that their facility violated Section A, Article IV of the zoning ordinance.  Appellants ordered appellees to cease the violation.  Subsequently, appellees initiated this action to enjoin the application of the zoning resolution to its site.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the resulting litigation, the General Assembly passed Am. S.B. No. 269, effective October 9, 1980.  That legislation amended R.C. Chapter 3734 relative to the transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes.  Of particular importance to this case is the enactment of R.C. 3734.05(D)(3) which prohibits the regulation of properly licensed hazardous waste disposal facilities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by political subdivisions of the state.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that as a result of R.C. 3734.05(D)(3) appellants' zoning resolution could not regulate hazardous waste facilities.  The appellants argued that R.C. 3734.05(D)(3) is unconstitutional; hence, it cannot serve as a basis for judgment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held that R.C. 3734.05(D)(3) was a &quot;general law,&quot; that it had uniform operation throughout the state, and that such statute is constitutional and precludes application of the zoning ordinance.  The court entered judgment for the appellees.  Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellee facility initiated an action to enjoin the application of a zoning resolution that prohibited private ownership of hazardous waste facilities. Appellant city sought review of a decision by the Court of Appeals, Clermont County (Ohio) that granted summary judgment in favor of the facility on grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) prohibited the city from passing zoning resolutions to regulate hazardous waste facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">While the privately owned hazardous waste disposal facility was litigating a new law passed by the city, which prohibited privately owned facilities in that city, the legislature passed an amendment which prohibited the city from regulating such facilities. As a result of the amendment, the facility was granted its motion for summary judgment in the ongoing litigation. The city contended that the amendment to &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) was unconstitutional in that it was a general law that it did not have uniform application and violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. The court held that the legislature could limit the application of a statute to a given class even if it resulted in the statute not operating in all geographic areas of the state, as long as the classification was reasonable and the statute operated equally among everyone in the given class. The court found that the legislature intended &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) to have uniform application because it applied to all &quot;political subdivisions&quot; and was a reasonable enforcement of the state's police powers. As such, the amendment was constitutional and took precedence over conflicting state laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the facility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1953 the General Assembly enacted R.C. 4123.412, which created the Disabled Workers' Relief Fund (DWRF).  since its inception the DWRF has provided a subsidy to qualifying permanently and totally disabled recipients of workers' compensation.  Generally speaking, disabled workers are eligible for a DWRF payment if their combined workers' compensation and Social Security disability benefits amount to less than a statutorily mandated base.  R.C. 4123.412.  The monthly subsidy received by an eligible worker is calculated by subtracting the sum of workers' compensation and social security from the statutory base (DWRF = Base - [WC + SS]).  R.C. 4123.414. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DWRF subsidies were paid from the state's general revenues from 1953 to 1959.  In 1959 the General Assembly provided, pursuant to R.C. 4123.411, for an employer payroll assessment to fund the DWRF.  In 1975 the statute was amended to increase the payroll assessment.  The amendment further provided: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the event the amount produced by the assessment is not sufficient to carry out such sections the additional amount necessary shall be provided from the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  income produced as a result of investments made pursuant to section 4123.44 of the Revised Code.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transfer of investment income from the State Insurance Fund (SIF) to the DWRF began in March 1976.  To date some $ 100 million has been transferred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, C. Russell Thompson, commenced the instant litigation in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, in 1977, as a class action brought on behalf of all Ohio employers who are required to contribute to the SIF pursuant to R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.30.  His complaint alleged that the transfer of SIF investment income to the DWRF authorized by R.C. 4123.411 was unconstitutional and sought an order prohibiting further transfers, the reimbursement of moneys previously transferred, and other relief.  The parties stipulated to the facts and both sides entered motions for summary judgment.  The court granted appellant's summary judgment motion whereupon appellee appealed to the Court of Appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.  The Court of Appeals held &quot;that R.C. 4123.411, to the extent that it provides for paying into the DWRF income produced as a result of investing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any portion of the SIF, which income has in turn been paid to the SIF, is in direct contravention of Article II, Section 35, of the Ohio Constitution.&quot; This holding was premised on the finding that &quot;[o]nce the income is earned and paid * * * into the SIF, * * * the income becomes a part of the trust fund, and cannot be applied to any purpose other than that permitted by Article II, Section 35, of the Ohio Constitution.&quot; The court rejected appellee's alternative contention that DWRF payments violate the proscription against retroactive laws contained in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant commission challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which reversed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the commission in appellee employer's class action regarding contribution to the State Insurance Fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The employer alleged that the transfer of the fund's investment income to the Disabled Workers' Relief Fund (DWRF) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.411 was in direct contravention of the state constitution. On review, the court reversed. The court found that the recipients of the DWRF subsidy, namely those permanently and totally disabled employees who had previously been awarded workers' compensation, were clearly members of the appropriate designated group. The court found that an insured had no claim on income earned from his premium payments, and the employer was not entitled to an automatic premium reduction by reason of the fund having made money on his money. The court determined that the employer had not been prejudiced insofar as the transfer of fund income to the DWRF resulted in lower DWRF assessments than he would otherwise have been required to pay. The court also found that the DWRF subsidy received by eligible disabled workers infused Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 with a meaningfulness that was fully consistent with the goals that prompted the initial approval of art. II, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 23, 1980, appellee Chester Jackson was charged by affidavit with falsification in violation of Section 2315.08 of the Columbus City Code.  The affidavit stated that &quot;* * * on or about the 22 day of August 1980 [appellee] did knowingly make a false oral unsworn statement, to wit: that his name was Michael Patterson, to a law enforcement officer, to wit: Bryan Sperry * * * who was acting within the scope of his duties, to wit: investigating a stolen check complaint.  * * *&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee Ballard Gary New was charged on August 29, 1980, with violation of the same ordinance in that he, &quot;* * * on or about the 19th day of July 1980 did knowingly make a false oral statement to wit: stated that his name was William Lewis Elkins to a law enforcement officer to wit: Off.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both cases, the respective trial court dismissed the charges upon motions by the appellees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Two defendants were charged with giving false names to police officers, in violation of &sect; 2315.08, which made it a crime to knowingly make a false, oral or written, sworn or unsworn, statement to a law enforcement officer acting within the scope of his duties. The common pleas court dismissed the charges upon finding the ordinance unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed and a motion to certify the record was allowed. In affirming, the supreme court agreed that &sect; 2315.08 did not pass constitutional muster under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ordinance was void for vagueness because it encouraged arbitrary enforcement and failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was forbidden. It impermissibly gave police unfettered discretion and there was no language in the ordinance that would permit a restrictive construction to prevent it from being overbroad. Moreover, it impermissibly allowed for the employment of coercive inquisition as a method of criminal investigation in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court found that as the case involved an interpretation of a statute concerning trafficking of obscene materials, no First Amendment rights of free speech were involved. Because no fundamental right or suspect classification was involved, the test to determine whether Ohio Rev.

The fact that an employee projectionist was a union member and assigned to a given theater by way of union hall assignment did not justify the classification contained in &sect; 2907.35(C). The continuance, or maintenance, of the existing contract arrangements between the projectionists' union and the various theaters did not rise to the status of a legitimate state interest. Thus, there was no legitimate state purpose that was served by the classification created in &sect; 2907.35(C), and the court held that the exemption of motion picture projectionists from prosecution under Ohio Rev.

The Beckett Ridge PUD is a large residential-commercial development with at least ten percent of the land space designated as a greenbelt or common open space.  Appellant challenged the assessed values of the 15 parcels for the tax year 1977 by filing two complaints with the auditor of Butler County.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The taxpayer was a not-for-profit corporation. The land in question was 15 parcels of real estate designated as &quot;common open space&quot; within a planned unit development (PUD) located within the County.

In reversing the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, the court ruled that the Board erred when it adopted a valuation of the land that was supported only by an appraisal and which ignored the use restrictions, easements, zoning and other factors affecting the then land. The court ruled that under Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 22, 1979, appellee, Moses J. Wilcox, and an accomplice, Jesse Custom, broke into and ransacked the home of Duane D. Dixon, an acquaintance of Custom.  During the course of the burglary Dixon was shot to death.  Custom was apprehended within hours of the discovery of the body and a warrant was issued for appellee.  He was arrested several months later on an unrelated charge by Warrensville Heights police and then transferred to the Cleveland City Jail.  While in jail, appellee made a statement (unchallenged on appeal to this court) regarding the Dixon burglary-homicide.  In his statement appellee admitted his involvement in the break-in but implicated Custom as the triggerman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 16, 1980, appellee was indicted for violations of R.C. 2903.01 (aggravated murder) and R.C. 2911.11 (aggravated burglary).  On January 30, 1980, the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County upon motion, referred appellee to the court psychiatric clinic, pursuant to R.C. 2945.371 and 2945.39, for an evaluation to determine whether he was competent to stand trial and whether he was sane when the criminal acts occurred.  The examining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  psychiatrist found appellee to be borderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome and so testified at a March 1980 hearing.  The court ruled that appellee was incompetent to stand trial and committed him to Lima State Hospital for treatment.  In August 1980 appellee was again brought before the court and after a hearing the court determined that he was competent to stand trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial was held commencing August 18, 1980.  Appellee entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and at trial introduced psychiatric testimony with respect thereto.  The trial court, however, refused to permit additional psychiatric testimony or charge the jury on the question of whether appellee's supposed diminished mental capacity precluded him from forming the specific intent to commit the offenses of aggravated murder and aggravated burglary.  The jury rejected appellee's insanity defense and found him guilty on both counts.  The court sentenced appellee to concurrent terms of life and 6-25 years for the murder and burglary offenses, respectively.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial court in a split decision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and ordered a new trial.  The court held that &quot;diminished capacity is a valid defense as tending to negate the elements of specific intent in particular crimes,&quot; and further held that the trial court's &quot;refusal to permit testimony [or a special jury instruction] on the defense of diminished capacity constitutes reversible error.&quot; Judge (now Justice) Krupansky, dissenting, was satisfied that sufficient evidence of appellee's mental capacity was before the jury and that the requested special instruction was unwarranted.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts in this case are undisputed.  On December 1, 1972, appellant Jack T. Whitmer was operating an automobile owned by his father, appellant Harold E. Whitmer, on a highway within Montgomery County.  Vicki L. Butler was a passenger in that vehicle.  A series of events, the precise nature of which is immaterial to the issues here considered, resulted in Whitmer's collision with an automobile operated by Connie K. Barnett and in a collision with a third vehicle operated by Scott C. Charlesworth, as a consequence of which Butler suffered extensive personal injuries.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 4, 1976, National Mutual Insurance Company (National), the appellee, as the insurer of Barnett, paid Butler (and her parents) the sum of $ 20,500 as compensation for her injuries and obtained a release </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the Butlers.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 21, 1977, National commenced an action for contribution against the Whitmers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Court of Common Pleas.  Ultimately, the case was heard by a referee of the court upon whose report and recommendation judgment was entered in favor of National.  The court found that, as a result of its payment to the Butlers, National was subrogated to Barnett's right of contribution to the extent of the amount it had paid in excess of Butler's injuries as caused by the joint tort of Barnett and Whitmer.The court adopted the finding of its referee that Jack Whitmer was 60 percent responsible for those injuries and, accordingly, awarded judgment in favor of National for $ 12,300, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the amount it had paid in excess of Barnett's proportionate share of her common liability with Whitmer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the course of the litigation, the Whitmers objected to the proceeding because recovery on the claim would require an unconstitutional retroactive application of the Ohio Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their contention was predicated upon the fact that National paid the consideration for the release from the Butlers on October 4, 1976, three days following the effective date of the statutes upon which the company's claim for contribution was premised and some 46 months&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after the tort had been committed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellants, an owner and a driver of a car involved in a collision, sought review of a decision of a trial court, which adopted the report and recommendation of its referee in favor of appellee, an insurer of a second driver of another vehicle involved in the collision, in the insurer's action for contribution against appellants. The Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio) affirmed but certified the record to the court for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">A passenger in the driver's car was injured in the collision. The insurer made a payment to the passenger and her parents for her injuries and obtained a release. The trial court found that the insurer was subrogated to the second driver's right of contribution to the extent of the amount it had paid in excess of the passenger's injuries as caused by the joint tort of the second driver and the driver. Appellants contended that recovery on the claim would require an unconstitutional retroactive application of the Ohio Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act. In affirming the decision, the court held that the award of judgment to the insurer did not require any retroactive application of the Act because, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2307.31 and 2307.32, liability for contribution arose only in favor of a joint tortfeasor and then only when that tortfeasor had paid more than his proportionate share of the common liability. Thus, the obligation of appellants to their joint tortfeasor did not arise until the second driver had paid, through the insurer, an amount in excess of her proportionate share to discharge the common liability, which was made after the effective date of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 16, 1979, appellant Mills-Jennings of Ohio, Inc., filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County seeking a declaratory judgment. The specific relief sought by appellant was a declaration by the court that certain devices, known as &quot;Draw Poker&quot; machines, were not gambling devices per se and that possession of the machines was not a violation of either the laws of Ohio or the regulations of the Liquor Control Commission. The complaint sought a permanent injunction enjoining the Department of Liquor Control, or any of its agents or employees, from seizing or confiscating Draw Poker machines owned by appellant and located in various liquor permit premises throughout Ohio. The complaint also sought to enjoin the Department of Liquor Control from interfering with the business of liquor permit premises based solely on possession of Draw Poker machines unless the machines were being operated in a way in which a monetary payoff or a payoff of any other tangible item of value was being made to the player. Appellant Walter Lazuka, owner of devices known as &quot;TV Draw Poker&quot; machines, was granted leave&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to intervene as a new party plaintiff and requested relief similar to that of appellant Mills-Jennings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Draw Poker machine in question is an electronic video-game controlled entirely by a computer called a microprocessor. The computer takes the place of a person who would otherwise serve as the dealer in a game of draw poker. In order to activate the machine for play, a player inserts from one to eight quarters into the machine. The player then pushes a button denoted as &quot;draw&quot; and by random selection, five cards appear on the screen. The player has the option of keeping all five cards or any one or more of them. When the player has decided which cards to keep, he then presses the &quot;discard&quot; button, eliminating from the screen the cards the player does not wish to keep. The cards discarded are then replaced with new and different cards and this ends the game. If the player chooses not to discard any cards and wishes to &quot;stand&quot; on the original five cards dealt by the machine, the player simply pushes the &quot;stand&quot; button and this also ends the game. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the game is to get the best poker hand possible. When a winning hand appears the player is awarded a free replay or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  replays depending on the value of the hand. These replays are called &quot;skill points&quot; and the number of skill points awarded are multiplied by the number of quarters inserted. If a player's winning hand was a &quot;straight&quot; worth five skill points and the player had inserted eight quarters, the player would be awarded 40 skill points. Likewise a player can win up to 400 free replays on one play if the player obtains a &quot;straight flush&quot; after having inserted eight quarters.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject property involved in the dispute is approximately four acres of land in Xenia Township, Greene County, owned by William S. and Glenna M. Carl.  They purchased the land in April 1977, and subsequently leased it to Express Transport Company for use as a trucking business.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area was zoned &quot;A-1, Agriculture&quot; at the relevant times when the Carls purchased the land and obtained a building permit for a trucking terminal, and the trucking business commenced operation.  In June 1978, to ensure the continued operation of the business, the Carls applied for a change in classification with the Xenia Township Zoning Commission.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 5, 1978, the state, on behalf of Francis M. and Sandra J. Taylor, appellants herein, initiated this action by filing a petition against Paul Whitehead, Zoning Inspector, the Carls, the members of the zoning commission and the members of the board of township trustees, appellees herein.  The petition sought, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a writ of mandamus to enforce the existing agricultural classification, a writ of prohibition against acting on the Carls' application for a change in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  zoning classification, and an injunction to prevent the continued operation of the trucking business.  In their answer, the Carls contended that the trucking business was exempt as a public utility under R.C. 519.21.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, in October 1978, the board of township trustee approved the application for a change in zoning to accommodate the trucking business.  The zoning classification was changed to &quot;B-3, Highway Business.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first issue the trial court considered was whether the trucking business was a public utility, and, thus, exempt from local zoning regulations.  Following a hearing, the court determined that Express Transport was a public utility.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Although the petition included an allegation that the trucking business constituted a nuisance, the appellants voluntarily dismissed it, without prejudice, prior to a hearing.  Thus, it is not an issue in this appeal. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the appellants did not challenge this determination.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, they argued that neighboring landowners have a property right in the zoning classification subject only to the lawful change in the classification.  The court affirmed the trial court and held that local zoning ordinances&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are not applicable to public utilities and, thus, no unlawful action had occurred.  <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;Appellants did not brief the proposition that the trucking business should not be considered a public utility for purposes of the statutory exemption because, unlike other utilities or railroads, it does not have the power of eminent domain and the service rendered has no relation to the neighboring land.  Therefore, it was not considered in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The property owners leased their land for use as a trucking business when it was zoned for agricultural use. In response to the State's petition seeking to enforce the agricultural classification, the trial court found for appellees and held that the trucking business was a public utility and exempt from zoning regulations. Appellants did not challenge that determination but argued that neighboring landowners had a property right in the zoning classification subject only to the lawful change in the classification. Seeking further review, appellants contended that the use of land by a public utility not possessing the power of eminent domain, in violation of township zoning regulations, was an unconstitutional taking without compensation of neighboring property owners' right of enjoyment. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the zoning classification imposed was irrelevant because public utilities were exempt according to Ohio Rev, Code Ann. &sect; 519.21. Appellants' allegations did not constitute a taking because they did not satisfy the degree of interference or injury required by Ohio law to establish a taking. Diminution of the property value was not itself a taking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 29, 1980, William R. Lilliock, defendant, appellee herein, was apprehended while driving his 1975 Ford Econoline van on Interstate 70 in Franklin County.  Defendant's vehicle matched the description of a van connected with a reported breaking and entering of a truck which occurred earlier at a truck stop in Licking County near Duke's Inn Motel.  Defendant voluntarily drove back to the truck stop, and executed a written consent to a search of his vehicle.  In addition to various snack food items, office equipment was found in the van and subsequently identified as property stolen from an office located in Duke's Inn.  Defendant was charged with breaking and entering (in connection with the snack foods) and receiving stolen property (the office equipment).  Following acquittal on the former charge, and conviction on the latter, he was sentenced to two to five years imprisonment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 26, 1980, one day after judgment entry, the state filed an application with the trial court under R.C. 2933.41 for disposition of defendant's van, which had been seized and impounded by the sheriff's department.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court thereafter declared the van forfeited and ordered ownership of the van transferred to the Licking County Commissioners.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Presumably, the van would be available for use by the sheriff's department in undercover work, such a need being stated in the application for disposition of property filed by the Licking County Prosecutor's Office.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed both his conviction and forfeiture to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the conviction, but vacated the forfeiture in a split decision, finding the van not subject to forfeiture under R.C. 2933.41.

A subsequent search of defendant's van revealed various snack items and office equipment identified as property stolen from an office near the location where the truck was broken into. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. The court found that &sect; 2933.41 required that the property at issue had to be used by the offender in the commission of an offense, and it had to be unlawful for the offender to possess the property. Neither of the requirements was fulfilled by defendant's actions. Defendant received the stolen property when he paid an accomplice for the items. The commission of the offense, in terms of &sect; 2933.41, occurred before the items were placed in defendant's van. As to the second requirement, there was nothing in the nature of the van that would have deemed it unlawful for defendant to possess it. The court found that there was no relation between the loss of defendant's right to possess the van and any legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The village of Covington (&quot;village&quot;), appellant, charged, William E.

The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court because the structure of the statutory form of the village's government did not violate the resident's right to due process of law under the Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in mandamus originating in this court.  Relator, David W. Swetland, d.b.a. Park Investment Company, contends Amended Substitute House Bill No. 50 (Am. Sub. H.B. No. 50), enacted pursuant to authorization contained in Section 2a, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution, is unconstitutional and void because it defines &quot;preceding year&quot; in a manner which conflicts with the meaning of that term in Section 2a, Article XII.  Relator asserts the General Assembly exceeded the grant of authority contained in Section 2a, Article XII, by enacting Am. Sub. H.B. No. 50, and he therefore requests this court to issue a writ of mandamus directing respondent, Robert R. Kinney, Commissioner of Tax Equalization, to compute the tax reduction factors provided in R.C. 319.301 without reference to Am. Sub. H.B. No. 50.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November of 1980 the voters of Ohio approved an amendment to the Ohio Constitution which resulted in the addition of Section 2a to Article XII.  Section 2a, Article XII, provides in relevant part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(C) Notwithstanding Section 2 of this article, laws may be passed that provide all of the following: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) Land and improvements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereon in each taxing district shall be placed into one of two classes solely for the purpose of separately reducing the taxes charged against all land and improvements in each of the two classes as provided in division (C)(2) of this section.  The classes shall be: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) Residential and agricultural land and improvements; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) All other land and improvements.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) With respect to each voted tax authorized to be levied by each taxing district, the amount of taxes imposed by such tax against all land and improvements thereon in each class shall be reduced in order that the amount charged for collection against all land and improvements in that class in the current year, exclusive of land and improvements not taxed by the district in both the preceding year and in the current year and those not taxed in that class in the preceding year, equals the amount charged for collection against such land and improvements in the preceding year.  * * *&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the authorization contained in this amendment the General Assembly enacted Am. H.B. No. 1238, effective December 19, 1980.  Am. H.B. No. 1238 amended R.C. 319.30 and 319.301 to provide that the percentage reduction for real property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taxes calculated according to these sections, commonly referred to as the &quot;tax reduction factor,&quot; should henceforth be computed separately for each of the two classes of real estate created by the constitutional amendment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The procedure for calculating the tax reduction factor in light of the addition of Section 2a to Article XII was further clarified through the enactment of Am. Sub. H.B. No. 50, effective October 12, 1981.  Am Sub. H.B. No. 50 states in pertinent part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1.  (A) * * * for purposes of making the computations under Section 319.301 of the Revised Code for the voted taxes levied for the 1981 tax year only, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">'preceding year,'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as provided in division (D)(1) of such section, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">means the year immediately preceding the first reappraisal or any countywide adjustment thereto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in which the sums levied against all real property by any voted tax were first reduced by a percentage in order that they would have levied the same number of dollars in that current year, exclusive of any sums levied against improvements added to the tax list since the year preceding that current year, as were charged against the same real property in the year preceding the current year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(B) For purposes of making such computations: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) 'Tax levied for the first time' means a voted tax levied for the first time, either in the year of or in any year after, the year immediately preceding the first reappraisal or any countywide adjustment thereto in which the sums levied against all real property by any voted tax were first reduced by a percentage in order that they would have levied the same number of dollars in that current year, exclusive of any sums levied against improvements to the tax list since the year preceding that current year, as were charged against the same real property in the year preceding that current year.  A voted tax that is a renewal of an existing tax is not a tax levied for the first time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">'Preceding year,' with respect to a tax levied for the first time, means the year in which the voted tax was levied.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Emphasis added.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator maintains the above definition of &quot;preceding year&quot; renders Am. Sub. H.B. No. 50 unconstitutional because it defines that term differently than the constitutional amendment it was intended to effectuate.  As stated by the relator in his complaint: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amended Substitute House Bill No. 50 is unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and void in that it defines 'preceding year' as contained in Ohio Revised Code Section 319.301 to be a year other than the actual year preceding 1981 whereas Article XII, Section 2a would require that the year preceding 1981 be 1980.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, relator urges this court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling respondent to calculate the tax reduction factors pursuant to R.C. 319.301 without regard to Am. Sub. H.B. No. 50.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The challenged bill was an attempt to eradicate the inadequacies of the existing tax reduction system, which unfairly burdened residential and agricultural real property owners.

The court denied the individual's request for mandamus relief. The law was presumed constitutional, and the individual failed to show beyond a reasonable or rational doubt that the bill and Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2a were clearly incompatible. In addition, the court concluded that the general assembly's definition of &quot;preceding year&quot; in the bill unquestionably furthered the intent of art. XII, &sect; 2a, which was to ensure equality of treatment of real property owners.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, one item referred to &quot;LUCY'S PERPETUAL NOTION - The Drink Exchange.&quot; The promotion would permit a customer of the restaurant to obtain a drink in the discotheque &quot;for only 50 ,&quot; and then upon returning to the restaurant the next day receive the same price: &quot;[s]avor lunch in the dining room daily and you're rewarded not only with fine food, but you can get two drinks a day for only $ 1.00, 'cause SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES YOU!'&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Sic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ) The other item advertised a &quot;COY BACON BEING TRADED PARTY&quot; at which drinks would be sold for 79 cents.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newsletter had been published for approximately one year and was distributed on the permit premises&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and was also mailed to members of appellant's club.  The mailings occurred on the second Friday of each month.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The restaurant owner operated a night club and restaurant. The restaurant owner had a liquor permit. The restaurant owner circulated flyers advertising drink specials. The commission brought proceedings against the restaurant owner for violating Ohio Admin. Code 4301:1-1-44, which gave the commission control over advertising of alcoholic beverages. The court of common pleas reversed the commission's decision and the court of appeals again reversed, affirming the commission's decision to suspend the restaurant owner's permit for seven days. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the commission had been given the authority by the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.03 to adopt regulations governing advertisement of alcoholic beverages. The court also held that the rule did not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Although protected by the First Amendment, the lawful commercial speech here was legitimately regulated to serve the important governmental interest of discouraging consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the regulation itself was not overly extensive. Thus, the regulation satisfied the test concerning regulation of commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Scott (&quot;appellant&quot;) met an undercover agent at a lounge bar in Fairborn at approximately 9:00 p.m. on September 4, 1979.  The agent and appellant had previously discussed drug sales.  Appellant told the agent that he could get some &quot;speed&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for him.  The agent said that he wanted to make a purchase.  They traveled together in the agent's car first to another lounge bar in Fairborn and later to appellant's home, 318 Wallace Drive in Fairborn.  <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;&quot;Speed&quot; is a vernacular term for amphetamines, which are controlled substances under R.C. Chapter 2925.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant said that he could not quote a price until he saw what his source had available.  He entered 308 Wallace Drive and returned to the car to tell the agent that his source had 12 robin eggs of &quot;speed&quot; for $ 2 per tablet.  He brought 12 white oblong tablets with blue specks to the car.  The agent visually inspected the tablets.  Appellant received $ 24 from the agent and took the money to the girl who provided him with the tablets.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis demonstrated that the tablets did not contain a controlled substance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties stipulated to these facts, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as clarified by appellant in response to questioning by the court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Greene County grand jury indicted appellant under R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), the Court of Common Pleas accepted appellant's plea of no contest and found him guilty, based upon the stipulated facts and appellant's testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Greene County (Ohio), which affirmed defendant's conviction for violating Ohio Rev.

The tablets did not contain a controlled substance, but defendant was charged with and pleaded no contest to knowingly offering to sell a controlled substance. The common pleas court accepted defendant's plea and found him guilty based on the facts and his testimony. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and held that &sect; 2925.03(A)(1) was clear and not unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court found that the proscribed conduct of &sect; 2925.03(A)(1) was offering to sell a controlled substance, not offering the controlled substance, and that by using the phrase &quot;offer to sell&quot; in the disjunctive with &quot;sell&quot; throughout the statute, the legislature expressly and properly prohibited defendant's conduct as a form of trafficking in drugs. The court concluded that &sect; 2925.03(A)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because all the Due Process Clause required was that the law give sufficient warning that men might conduct themselves so as to avoid that which was forbidden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Ottawa County.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from the affirmance of a summary judgment granted to the appellees, Board of Township Trustees of Danbury Township, and its individual members.  Johnson's Island, Inc., appellant, brought this declaratory judgment action in the Court of Common Pleas of Ottawa County, seeking a determination that the Zoning Resolution of Danbury Township was unconstitutional as applied to appellant's property.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts giving rise to the action, and to this appeal, are that Johnson's Island is a relatively small 275-acre island in Lake Erie lying in Sandusky Bay within Danbury Township, Ottawa County, connected to the mainland by a causeway.  In 1956, the appellant purchased the entire island with the exception of a Confederate Soldiers' Cemetery owned by the United States Veterans Administration, the property being acquired for the purpose of subdividing and selling building lots.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Located upon Johnson's Island was a limestone quarry which had been actively mined a number of years prior to the appellant's purchase, but at the time was inactive.  The appellant recorded and obtained approval of a subdivision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plan for the sale of lots, principally located around the perimeter of the island, for the construction of summer homes.  In addition to this sales activity, it appears that the appellant, sometime after the purchase, also began certain activities in the quarry such as draining the quarry of water, blasting and removing loose limestone for building a marina, and removing some of the stone for building a causeway to the mainland.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, a comprehensive zoning plan was adopted by Danbury Township in which the entire island was zoned residential (multi-family residential district [R-3]).  Prior to the adoption of the zoning plan, the island was developed with approximately 75 improved home sites, which lots had been sold by Johnson's Island, Inc.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1977, the homeowners' association, Johnson's Island Club, Inc., and one of its members, sought and obtained an injunction in the Court of Common Pleas of Ottawa County, case No. 19567, to prevent Johnson's Island, Inc., from conducting any quarry operations in the limestone quarry.  In their complaint the plaintiffs alleged, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the ongoing quarrying operation violated the permitted use classification of plaintiffs' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property under the zoning resolution, in that &quot;quarrying&quot; was a use permitted only in a heavy manufacturing district (M-2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the potential zoning issues in this initial controversy, Johnson's Island elected to rely on the fact that it had established a &quot;nonconforming use&quot; by virtue of quarrying the property prior to the adoption of the zoning resolution, and even thereafter.  Johnson's Island did not challenge the constitutionality of the township zoning regulation as applied to its quarry site.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court, in its findings of fact and conclusions of law, rejected defendants' argument, holding that Johnson's Island had failed to establish a nonconforming use in existence at the time of the enactment of the Danbury zoning resolution in 1975.  On July 7, 1977, the trial court issued an injunction to prevent further quarrying.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and this court overruled a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 4, 1978, the appellant filed a complaint in the instant matter seeking a declaratory judgment, framing the prayer in two issues: (1) that the residential classification is unconstitutional as applied to appellant's land, and (2) that the parcel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which consisted of some 75.6 acres of appellant's property falls properly within an M-2 heavy manufacturing classification.  The purpose of the desired zoning change was to enable the appellant to conduct a limestone quarrying operation on the island.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In answer to the complaint for declaratory judgment, the appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the appellant and other quarrying contractors were defendants in the prior case, No. 19567, in the Court of Common Pleas of Ottawa County, and that the judgment in such action was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the issues presented in this declaratory judgment action.  The trial court agreed, and granted summary judgment for the appellees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The landowner filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that a residential zoning classification was unconstitutional as applied to its land, and that the parcel, which was the site of a former quarry, fell properly within the heavy manufacturing classification. The landowner sought to conduct a limestone quarrying operation. The board of trustees filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the landowner was a defendant in a prior zoning action against the quarry operators. The trial court granted the motion and held that the prior action was res judicata. The appellate court affirmed. On further review, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment and rejected the landowner's claim that res judicata did not apply. The landowner argued that it could not have raised the constitutional issue in the prior action because at that time, the landowner had not exhausted administrative remedies. The court found otherwise and held that, because the landowner was in a defensive position in the prior action, exhaustion was not required and that the landowner's action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This matter brings into issue the viability of Ohio's existing principle of interspousal tort immunity.  The facts giving rise to this question are not controverted.  Appellant, Hanna L. Bonkowsky, and appellee, Otto R. Bonkowsky, are wife and husband, respectively.  While on an automobile trip in the state of Vermont, appellee was driving and appellant was a passenger in the car when an accident occurred, and appellant was injured.  Appellant filed an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County against appellee, claiming negligence on the part of the latter.  The parties stipulated to the existence of automobile liability insurance, and that the policy did not expressly bar such an action.  The appellee moved for summary judgment, contending that interspousal immunity barred the claim despite the fact that the law of the state of Vermont would allow such an action.  The Court of Common Pleas granted such motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed upon the basis of Ohio's previously pronounced position on interspousal immunity.  </SPAN></P>

The wife argued that the principle of interspousal immunity should not be followed because there was liability insurance under which her claims could be satisfied and the reasons supportive of the principle were no longer viable. On appeal, the court adhered to its previously pronounced position in favor of interspousal immunity because the doctrine reasonably related to the legitimate state interest of fostering marital harmony and preventing fraud and collusion. The court's recent precedent reviewing the viability of such policies should be given a great deal of weight.</SPAN></P>

Defendant-appellee, James W. O'Leary, is a private investigator.  On the evening of June 14, 1979, appellee's assignment was to keep a subject's car under surveillance.  At approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening appellee's car was parked in a May Company parking lot in the city of University Heights.  Also in the parking lot was a van, upon which several police officers converged to arrest the occupants for the illegal sale of fireworks.  After the arrest, officers of the University Heights Police Department came over to appellee's car in which appellee's co-worker, Gerald Wright, was sitting to investigate his presence in the parking lot after store hours. During the course of the police questioning of Wright, an empty gun holster was observed on the floor of the automobile.  Wright was searched and a search was begun of the car.  Some cartridges were found in the car's glove compartment. Appellee returned while the police were searching the interior of the car.  Pursuant to police request, appellee opened the trunk of the car which contained several encased, unloaded weapons.  As a result of the discovery of these weapons, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellee was charged with violating Sections 626.04(a) and 626.09(a) of the Codified Ordinances of the city of University Heights, which proscribe the possession and carrying of a firearm in a vehicle in the city of University Heights unless the person has a &quot;Restricted Weapons Owner's Identification Card.&quot; Prior to trial appellee filed the following: (1) a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of the car and (2) a motion to dismiss the charges on the ground that Sections 626.04(a) and 626.09(a) were facially unconstitutional. An initial hearing on the charges was held on August 17, 1979, in the Shaker Heights Municipal Court.  The case was continued because neither the appellee, the prosecutor, nor the court could obtain the correct copies of the applicable ordinance. A subsequent hearing was held on August 21, 1979.  The court overruled appellee's first motion, finding the search and seizure constitutional. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the court, however, granted appellee's second motion, finding Sections 626.04(a) and 626.09(a) unconstitutional because they were overbroad, vague and unenforceable. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

The court reversed the appellate court's judgment for the mother and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to order a blood grouping test to be paid by the county. Under the Eldridge test, the court found that the private interests were substantial since the putative father had a pecuniary interest in avoiding substantial support obligations, and at issue was the creation of a parent-child relationship. The court ruled that access to blood grouping tests for indigent defendants would help insure the correctness of paternity decisions. Also, the State had a legitimate interest in a child born out of wedlock who was receiving public assistance. As such, the denial of blood grouping tests violated the putative father's due process guarantee under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause presents for review and determination by this court the question of whether R. C. 2711.21(C), a section of the Ohio Medical Malpractice Act, is constitutional. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts, in brief, giving rise to this appeal are that on March 14, 1978, the appellants, Sandra and Edward Beatty, filed an amended complaint against the appellees, Dr. Richard C. Walker and Akron City Hospital, alleging that appellees had performed a tubal ligation on Sandra Beatty without her consent.  The appellees answered and the matter was set for arbitration hearing pursuant to R. C. 2711.21.  The arbitration panel consisted of three lawyers, one appointed by each party, and one by the court.  After a hearing, the arbitrators determined that appellants had knowingly and voluntarily consented to the tubular ligation procedure and, accordingly, the arbitrators entered a finding in favor of the appellees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking a trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">de novo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appellants filed a second amended complaint on January 22, 1979, wherein they demanded a jury trial.  The appellees, pursuant to R. C. 2711.21(C), moved that the finding of the arbitrators be placed into evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at trial.  The appellants opposed the motion, asserting that R. C. 2711.21 was unconstitutional.  The trial court overruled appellants' contention and directed that the arbitrators' decision be admitted in evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 25, 1979, the trial commenced and, over appellants' objection, the arbitrators' finding was received into evidence.  The jury rendered verdicts for the appellees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeals.  In that appeal, the appellants contended that: (1) R. C. 2711.21 violates the appellants' right to a civil jury trial as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution; and (2)&nbsp;R. C. 2711.21 violates the constitutional guarantees of equal protection by treating medical claims in a judicially different manner (than other tort claims), there being no state interest sufficiently compelling to justify such different treatment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals held that the challenged section is constitutional and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 1, 1979, three males approached Fredrick Veshinfsky while he was at the Painesville recreation park.  One of these males tapped on Veshinfsky's car.  One approached him from behind and choked him until he lost consciousness.  Veshinfsky testified that, after he regained consciousness, he found his wallet outside his pants and that $ 110 and his glasses were missing.  He saw a white car going up a nearby hill.  Veshinfsky noticed the male who had tapped on his car looking back at him from inside the white car.  Veshinfsky pursued this car and pulled in front of it.  Veshinfsky left his car, and appellee James Spikes left the white car.  Veshinfsky testified that appellee then struck him several times in the nose and face. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reporting the incident to the Lake County sheriff's department, Veshinfsky went to Lake County Memorial Hospital.  Several hours later, he was transferred to Richmond Heights General Hospital.  Veshinfsky testified that he suffered a broken nose as well as having blood in his urine, trouble with his kidneys and back pains for two weeks. </SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the prosecutor to furnish appellee with the felony and misdemeanor record of appellee and any felony records of the state's witnesses.  The court observed that Crim.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court admitted in evidence, over defense objection, records from both of the hospitals at which Veshinfsky received treatment.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This civil case had its genesis in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County upon the conviction, sentence, and subsequent six and one-half year incarceration of Frank L. Johns, appellee herein, for the crime of selling marijuana on November 30, 1964.  After exhausting his state remedies, Johns filed an original action in habeas corpus in the federal District Court.  He claimed that his privately-retained, personally-selected lawyer had afforded him inadequate representation of counsel in the sole particular of his claim of alibi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District Court dismissed the petition, finding adequate representation, in that such private counsel had telephoned Johns' place of employment and was assured that Johns' employment records were not conclusive either way on the question of whether Johns was at work at the time of the alleged crime.  Thus, counsel had no essential duty to subpoena the records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, declaring that it was the duty of private counsel to subpoena all the employment records because they might have created a reasonable doubt.  Holding that the petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, the federal Court of Appeals remanded the case to the state courts &quot;with instructions to grant the writ unless the time cards can be located to permit a fair re-trial.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Johns </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Perini</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (C.A. 6, 1972), 462 F. 2d 1308, at 1315. The federal Court of Appeals observed that &quot;[t]he seriousness of the omission is emphasized by the fact that the employer routinely destroys time cards after five years.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio authorities were unable to prosecute Johns and he was released. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through counsel, Johns unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the General Assembly to enact a moral claim Bill, but ultimately was successful in the passage of Am. sub. S. B. No. 221, which provides, in part, as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 41.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 2743 of the Revised Code, Mr. Frank Johns, 12705 Craven Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, 44105, is hereby authorized to file a claim for damages in the Court of Claims for unlawful incarceration and for lost wages, legal expenses and general damages resulting from his alleged unlawful incarceration.  The Court of Claims, after all the evidence in support&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of this claim has been heard, shall determine: 1) whether the preponderance of the evidence offered supports a finding that Mr. Johns has been unlawfully incarcerated by the State of Ohio, and if this is so, 2) the dollar amount of damages to be awarded as compensation.  Funds shall be available from the balance in the reparations Rotary Fund to pay any award for damages made to Mr. Johns by the Court of Claims.  Such claim for damages must be filed prior to July 1, 1979, after which date the authority to file such claim shall expire.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johns filed a complaint in the Court of Claims subsequent to the enactment of this Bill, and the Court of Claims entered a summary judgment against him.  This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, which observed: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in effect held the judgment of conviction void or voidable, or whether such judgment is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for purposes of the issues raised herein, will not be discussed at this time in that it is not necessary to do so.  The Court of Claims, and this court, must consider the rights of this particular claimant in light of the special legislation enacted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which creates his cause of action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legislation dealt with here is very clear as to the duty of the Court of Claims.  The court must, according to the wording of the bill, first hear all of the evidence in support of the claim, and it then must determine 'whether the preponderance of the evidence offered supports a finding that Mr. Johns had been unlawfully incarcerated by the State of Ohio.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further, if the court so finds upon all of the evidence adduced that Mr. Johns was unlawfully incarcerated, then the court must determine dollar amount damages to be awarded as compensation.  Here, the Court of Claims decided this cause upon summary judgment, and did not permit plaintiff to submit any evidence upon the issue of unlawful incarceration.  How then can it be said that the legislative mandate to hear all of the evidence and determine by the preponderance of the evidence whether Mr. Johns had been unlawfully incarcerated has been carried out?  We must hold that the reasonable intent of the legislative enactment was for the Court of Claims to entertain and review the evidence on the issue of the unlawful incarceration, and to make its determination as to whether justice had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been done in the trial of the cause of Mr. Johns.  * * *&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon rehearing in the Court of Claims, counsel for Johns did not adduce evidence as to whether Johns had been unlawfully incarcerated by the state of Ohio, and objected to all evidence except that which went to the issue of damages.  This time the Court of Claims entered judgment in favor of the state of Ohio because it had no evidence to review on the first issue in the legislative mandate.  Johns through counsel had claimed that the judgment in habeas corpus entered by the federal Court of Appeals was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upon that issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal of this second Court of Claims' judgment, the Court of Appeals, composed of a different panel, departed from &quot;the law of the case&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which it had spelled out in the first review, and based its judgment on the sole proposition that the federal Court of Appeals judgment in habeas corpus was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upon the issue of &quot;unlawful incarceration by the State of Ohio.&quot; This time the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case with instructions to the Court of Claims to hear only evidence as to Johns' damages. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellee was convicted, sentenced, and incarcerated for selling marijuana. He was released early pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus. He then filed an action in the court of claims, seeking damages against appellant State of Ohio for unlawful incarceration. The State appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which reversed the court of claims' remand decision in favor of the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellee was released from prison, after serving a portion of his sentence for selling marijuana, on the basis of his habeas corpus petition, which alleged that he was without effective assistance of counsel on his alibi claim. Appellee subsequently filed a damages action against the State in the court of claims, pursuant to specially enacted legislation authorizing him to do so. On remand from the court of appeals, the court of claims entered a judgment in favor of the State due to appellee's failure to adduce any evidence that his incarceration was unlawful. The court of appeals, however, departed from &quot;the law of the case&quot; and reversed the judgment in favor of the State. On appeal, the court reversed the court of appeals' decision. The legislative enactment at issue did not presume appellee's entitlement to a key to the public treasury. Rather, it required the court of claims to independently determine that appellee's incarceration was unlawful before awarding him any damages. The decision in the habeas corpus action was not res judicata on the issue. Accordingly, appellee's failure to present evidence on the issue precluded a judgment in his favor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three cases are appeals taken from an order of appellee, Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (hereinafter &quot;commission&quot;), granting intervening appellee, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (hereinafter &quot;CEI&quot;), a rate increase of approximately $ 69.6 million.  The commission order further provided for the amortization over a ten-year period of CEI's substantial investment in four terminated nuclear power plants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Davis-Besse Units 2 and 3 and Erie Units 1 and 2 are the cancelled facilities at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's order dealt with two cases that had been consolidated.  Case No. 79-537-EL-AIR involved CEI's application to increase rates.  Case No. 79-744-EL-CMR concerned a complaint and appeal taken by CEI from a 1979 rate setting ordinance passed by the city of Cleveland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inasmuch as these three appeals primarily concern issues relating to the nuclear power plant cancellations, we shall briefly reprise the history of these now terminated facilities.  In 1967, CEI joined with four other electric companies to form the Central Area Power Coordination Group (CAPCO). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CAPCO companies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sought to achieve economies of scale and greater service reliability by jointly planning, constructing, and operating electrical generating facilities.  In 1973, the CAPCO group committed itself to build the four nuclear plants at issue herein based on forecasts that predicted a substantially increased demand for electricity by the CAPCO companies' customers during the 1970's and 1980's.  These forecasts subsequently had to be revised downward when increasing energy costs spurred conservation efforts and significantly softened the demand for electricity.  Moreover, the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island prompted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue stringent and costly new standards for nuclear power plants, requiring major design changes in the Babcock and Wilcox units that CAPCO planned to construct and operate.  After much study and redesign the CAPCO companies decided to terminate the four units on January 23, 1980.  When the decision to cancel the plants was announced, CAPCO had already invested considerable sums in the projects.  Preliminary expenses included expenditures for engineering, siting, environmental, geological, and seismic studies, and for obtaining state and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  federal licenses.  Moreover, to comply with detailed regulatory requirements and complete all the necessary documents, certain plant components had to be purchased at a fairly early stage in the planning process.  CEI's share of the total CAPCO investments in the four cancelled plants amounted to approximately $ 56,400,000 as of the date of termination. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;In addition to CEI the CAPCO group consists of Toledo Edison, Ohio Edison, and two Pennsylvania utilities, Duquesne Light Co. and Pennsylvania Power Co.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instant CEI rate case was pending before the commission when the plant terminations were announced. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission had accepted CEI's application for a rate increase as of September 17, 1979, and had established calendar year 1979 as the test year and June 30, 1979, as the date certain.  The commission staff conducted an investigation and issued its initial report in March 1980.  This report did not make reference to the terminated nuclear plants because CEI did not officially inform the commission of the plant cancellations until February 1980.  The commission staff, at appellants' request, then conducted a supplemental investigation to consider the effect of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  terminated plant expenditures on CEI's rate application.  The staff completed its investigation of the cancelled nuclear facilities and filed revised schedules in mid-April.  The staff recommended that the investment in the four nuclear plants should be amortized over a ten-year period as CEI had requested. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">3&nbsp;The rates established by the commission order in the instant ratemaking case have recently been superseded by new rates set by order on May 4, 1981 in case No. 80-376-EL-AIR.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public hearings on the rate increase application began on April 2, 1980, and continued for 32 days.  Staff witnesses appeared and testified at the hearings in regard to the cancelled nuclear plants and other matters contained in the application.  Appellants were represented at, and participated fully in, these public hearings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission issued its order on July 10, 1980.  Appellants timely filed for a rehearing which the commission denied as to the issues raised in the present appeal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">In its order, the Commission allowed a certain amount to be included in the rate base for construction work in progress (CWIP) pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4909.15(A)(1) and 4909.15(E). The court found no merit in the constitutional challenge to the CWIP provisions because the Commission's discretion was sufficiently circumscribed by the specific eligibility criteria enumerated in the statutes. However, the court determined that the Commission exceeded its statutory authority when it approved amortization of the electric company's investment in four terminated nuclear power plants. The court found that the Commission's action was not consistent with the statutorily mandated ratemaking formula contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.15. The court concluded that the extraordinary loss sustained by the electric company in connection with the terminated nuclear plants could not be transformed into an ordinary operating expense pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.15(A)(4) by Commission fiat. Nor did the court find statutory authorization for such action in the gross annual revenue determination under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the order of the Commission in part regarding the Commission's permitting an amount to be included in the rate base for CWIP.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This dispute arose when Lawrence W. Sirk, claimant, was injured during the course of his employment with the Kanter Corporation on January 8, 1974.  Claimant, a minor at the time of his injury, was injured when his left forearm became entangled in a rotating salt truck auger which he was cleaning.  Claimant filed a claim for workers' compensation which was allowed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, claimant filed a motion pursuant to R. C. 4123.89 with the Bureau of Workers' Compensation requesting the Industrial Commission to allow him an additional award of 100 percent of the maximum award established by law.  Claimant based his motion upon the allegation that his injury was a direct result of his employment, in violation of (former) R. C. 4109.12(D) and (U).  The commission granted claimant's motion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having no right of appeal from the commission's order, the appellee employer initiated this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County by filing a complaint for a writ of mandamus against the appellants, Anthony Stringer, Administrator of the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, and the members of the Industrial Commission.  Appellee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requested a writ of mandamus vacating the order awarding the additional 100 percent, and directing the commission to conduct a further hearing to determine a just additional award not less than 15 percent nor more than 50 percent of the maximum award established by law.  To support its position, appellee argued that, to the extent it requires an additional award in excess of 50 percent, R. C. 4123.89 conflicts with Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas held R.

Accordingly, the court issued a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order and hold a supplementary hearing to determine a just additional award, to be not less than 15 percent nor more than 50 percent of the maximum award authorized. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal and cross-appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas. </SPAN></P>

The trial and the appellate courts ruled that &sect; 4123.89 conflicted with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 because it mandated an additional award in excess of 50 percent. The court rejected the administrator and commission's contention that there was no conflict between Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.89 and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 and that Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Miami County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of January 21, 1979, defendant, Jerry Unger, appellant herein, was drinking beer with Rex A. Hopkins at Miller's Bar in Arcanum, Ohio.  The victim, Dennis Weaver, arrived at the bar and asked defendant for a ride to Minster, Ohio.  Defendant agreed to transport Weaver to Minster and asked Hopkins to accompany them on the trip. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As this trio was driving along, defendant and Hopkins decided, for an inexplicable reason, to kill Weaver.  Towards this end, defendant drove to a rustic area along the Stillwater River.  There, while defendant repeatedly stabbed the decedent, Hopkins beat him with a tire iron.  In an attempt to conceal the body, both men dragged the victim to an outhouse and placed him therein.  Hopkins also removed Weaver's wallet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the return trip to Arcanum, Unger and Hopkins stopped at a gasoline service station in Pitsburg, Ohio, where they informed one Alvin Bird of the murder which they had just committed.  Bird notified a Darke County deputy sheriff of this incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning hours of January 22, 1979, the Darke County deputy sheriff, accompanied by Bird and a Miami&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County deputy sheriff, searched the aforementioned site of the murder, where they discovered the mutilated body of the victim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, sheriff's deputies from Darke and Miami Counties arrested the defendant at his residence in Darke County, gave him his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings and transported him to the Miami County Jail.  During a subsequent interrogation by detectives from the Miami County Sheriff's Department, at which defendant was, again, apprised of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, defendant made a full confession pertaining to his participation in Weaver's murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was indicted for aggravated murder, in violation of R. C. 2903.01(A), and, on arraignment, entered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.  Accordingly, the trial court, on March 14, 1979, referred Unger to the Dayton Area Forensic Psychiatry Services, pursuant to R. C. 2945.39, for a psychological examination and determination of his mental condition at the time of Weaver's murder.  Defendant was informed by the trial court, simultaneous to this referral, that not only was he entitled to an independent psychiatric evaluation, but also, that he had the option to secure the independent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  examination at public expense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 11, 1979, five days before his scheduled trial, defendant requested and received a continuance from the trial court, until May 14, 1979, for the reason that another psychiatrist had purportedly agreed to examine him, apparently at the defendant's or his family's expense.  This examination never took place, allegedly because the psychiatrist would not perform the examination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interim, Dayton Area Forensic Psychiatry Services issued a report which concluded that defendant, at the time of the murder, was capable of distinguishing right from wrong and that he &quot;engaged in a series of purposive actions which required control and some degree of planning.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 9, 1979, five days before the rescheduled trial, defendant requested another continuance for the reason that he needed more time to secure a private, independent psychiatric evaluation.  After a hearing, the trial court overruled defendant's motion for this second continuance and the case proceeded to trial.  Defendant was convicted af aggravated murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed this conviction. </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2935.14; and that his automobile was unconstitutionally seized. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that defendant was informed, well in advance of any trial date, of his prerogative to have an additional psychiatric examination, so that he was not prejudiced by the denial of a late continuance when he failed to act earlier. In addition, even if &sect; 2935.14 was violated by defendant's transportation to another county before being allowed to speak to an attorney, the exclusionary rule was not violated because the statutory violation did not rise to a constitutional level. Finally, the impoundment of defendant's vehicle was reasonable and consistent with the tests mandated by controlling constitutional precedent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 28, 1978, Jauffre T. Slatter, appellee, was observed by two police officers to be holding an open container of an alcoholic beverage while standing on the west side of North Court Street in Athens, Ohio.  The officers approached appellee and, since he was standing with a large group of people who were engaging in a &quot;Halloween celebration,&quot; asked him to accompany them across the street.  While escorting appellee across the street, one of the officers placed his hand on appellee's arm.  Upon reaching the east side of North Court Street, the officers asked appellee for identification and, when appellee could not produce any, appellee was placed under arrest for a violation of an Athens city ordinance that prohibits the possession of open containers of alcohol on the public street, a minor misdemeanor. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellee was then taken to a police cruiser for transportation to police headquarters, but before he could be placed in the cruiser one of the arresting officers was attacked from behind by an unknown assailant.  When the second officer went to the defense of his partner, appellee fled the scene.  Appellee was later&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrested and indicted for a violation of R. C. 2921.34, escape. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;The &quot;open container&quot; prohibition is set forth in Section 93.04 of the Code of Ordinances of Athens, Ohio, as follows: &quot;No person shall have in his possession an open bottle, * * * containing any liquor, * * * in any other public place.&quot; Section 11.01 of the Code of Ordinances of Athens states: &quot;Each act or omission which is prohibited or declared unlawful in this Code of Ordinances is a minor misdemeanor, and in case no penalty of fine or imprisonment is otherwise provided, the offender, upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $ 100.00 for each such offense.&quot; </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;R. C. 2921.34 reads, in part: &quot;(A) No person, knowing he is under detention or being reckless in that regard, shall purposely break or attempt to break such detention, or purposely fail to return to detention, either following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited period, or at the time required when serving a sentence in intermittent confinement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee filed a pre-trial motion to suppress at trial any evidence concerning the initial arrest for the &quot;open container&quot; violation, asserting that his arrest occurred on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  west side of North Court Street and that such arrest was prohibited by R. C. 2935.26(A).  The state of Ohio, appellant, argued that the arrest had occurred on the east side of North Court Street, after appellee had been unable to produce identification, and, thus, was proper under R. C. 2935.26(A)(2).  Alternatively, appellant argued that R. C. 2935.26 was unconstitutional as being in conflict with Crim. R. 4.1(A) and (C).  At the hearing on the motion, the trial court found R. C. 2935.26 not to be unconstitutionally in conflict with Crim. R. 4.1.  The trial court also found: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1.) The arrest of the defendant occurred on the West [sic] side of N. Court Street in front of the Junction Bar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.) The arrest of the defendant was in violation of O.R.C. 2935.26 and therefore unlawful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3.) Evidence of the arrest and all surrounding or related activity is ORDERED suppressed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal of the constitutionality of R. C. 2935.26, the Court of Appeals for Athens County held that the statute created a substantive right of &quot;non-arrest except where &sect; 2935.26(A)(1)(2)(3)(4) apply.  * * * This statute acts to preclude arrest and is a guarantee of personal freedom given by the legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where no such right existed before.&quot; Thus, the statute was held to be not in conflict with a rule of procedure promulgated by this court.  The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The State challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed the trial court's decision to suppress evidence of defendant's arrest upon a violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2935.26 regarding authorization to arrest for the commission of a minor misdemeanor. The trial court held that &sect; 2935.26 created a substantive right of non-arrest with limited exceptions. Defendant had been arrested for an open intoxicants charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The State contended that &sect; 2935.26 conflicted with Ohio R. Crim. P. 3, 4, and 4.1 and was in violation of Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B). The court disagreed and affirmed the decision of the appellate court, holding that &sect; 2935.26 created a substantive right of freedom from arrest for one accused of the commission of a minor misdemeanor unless one of the statutory exemptions existed. The court agreed with the appellate court that the statute acted to preclude arrest and was a guarantee of personal freedom given by the legislature where no such right existed before. The right of non-arrest for a minor misdemeanor was created, defined, and regulated by the statute. The statute further was not to pertain to the method of enforcing that right as Ohio R. Crim. P. 4.1 did. The court found that the statute and the rule were complimentary, not in conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court, which upheld the validity of the statute pertaining to arrests for the commission of a minor misdemeanor and with regard to defendant's arrest for open intoxicants despite the State's appeal of that decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1979, Edwin C. Johnston, Judge of the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Hocking County (hereinafter appellee), submitted to the Board of County Commissioners of Hocking County (hereinafter appellants) a written request for an appropriation of funds for the 1980 fiscal year of $ 87,550, which included a personal service schedule for salaries of $ 71,000 and a departmental budget of $ 16,550. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties met twice in late December of 1979 to discuss appellee's appropriation request, the only significant change being a compromised reduction of the personal service schedule from $ 71,000 to $ 68,700. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to R. C. 2101.11, appellants, on January 2, 1980, advertised that, on January 3, a public hearing would be held to consider the written request submitted by appellee for the 1980 fiscal year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the hearing, appellants appropriated to the appellee for the operation of the Juvenile Court for 1980 the sum of $ 65,250, which included $ 53,050 for the personal service schedule and $ 12,200 for the departmental budget. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dissatisfied with the allocation, appellee timely initiated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an original action in mandamus in the Court of Appeals, praying that appellants be ordered to appropriate all the funds requested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an evidentiary hearing, the Court of Appeals granted appellee's request for the issuance of a writ of mandamus and ordered appellants to appropriate to the appellee $ 85,200, which consisted of $ 68,700 for the personal service schedule and $ 16,500 for the departmental budget. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 30, 1979, appellant, Judge Donald D. Simmons of the Court of Common Pleas of Wood County, entered a &quot;Journal Entry and Order&quot; directing appellees, the Board of County Commissioners and the Auditor of Wood County, to purchase, without competitive bidding, certain furnishings and equipment that appellant had ordered from David A. Sanders, Inc., for use in connection with Courtroom Two of the Wood County Courthouse.  In this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> order, appellant found that a real and present emergency existed because construction was soon to be completed on Courtroom Two and there was no suitable or available equipment and furnishings for the courtroom, jury room, judge's chambers, and that the need and cost of these items had not been budgeted with the cost of the construction and renovation project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 21, 1979, Judge Simmons entered a second order in response to a letter he had received that day from the board of county commissioners, in which they indicated they would not comply with the court's order of November 30.  In the second order, appellant ordered appellees to appear in court on January&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7, 1980, for a hearing to determine whether appellees would comply with the order of November 30 and to show cause why the commissioners should not be punished for their apparent contempt of court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 31, 1979, appellees filed a notice of appeal from the November 30 judgment entry and order, and a motion for a stay of enforcement of judgment pending appeal without a supersedeas bond.  Appellees, on the same day, also filed a writ of prohibition to prohibit the proposed January 7 proceedings.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint for a writ of prohibition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and granted a stay of enforcement of the November 30 order pending appeal without supersedeas bond. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Although appellees did not cross appeal the issue, we point out that the Court of Appeals acted correctly in dismissing appellee's complaint in prohibition.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Am. Sub. H. B. No. 204, which became effective on July 30, 1979, and terminates on June 30, 1981, sets forth the appropriations for fiscal year 1980 (July 1, 1979 to June 30, 1980) and fiscal year 1981 (July 1, 1980 to June 30, 1981).  The Act made a number of appropriations to the Ohio Rail Transportation Authority (ORTA), including three general revenue fund appropriations, these being (1) account number 401, which consists of $ 500,000 for line acquisition ($ 250,000 each year), (2) account number 402, which consists of $ 200,000 for line maintenance ($ 100,000 for each fiscal year), and (3) account number 403, which consists of $ 1,677,812 for the high speed rail program ($ 1,127,812 for fiscal year 1980, $ 550,000 for fiscal year 1981). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 30, 1980, the Controlling Board approved a request to transfer $ 932,704 from ORTA's appropriation for fiscal year 1980 to ORTA's account number 403 for fiscal year 1981.  The $ 932,704 consisted of unspent funds appropriated to accounts numbers 401, 402 and 403, as well as to two other accounts.  This action prevented the amounts appropriated from lapsing pursuant to R. C. 131.33, which states, in part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Except&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as provided in this section, appropriations made to a specific fiscal year shall only be expended to pay liabilities incurred within that fiscal year.  * * *&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late summer and early fall of 1980, ORTA solicited responses from engineering firms regarding the building of a test track to be located in northeastern Ohio.  Eighteen firms formed four teams which presented their proposals to a select committee of legislators, ORTA board members, and staff.  The committee recommended that a team consisting of Dalton, Dalton, Newport, Inc., as prime consultant, in association with Japan Railway Technical Services, DeLeuw and Poly-Tech, Inc., be selected as the consultant and awarded a contract. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 7, 1981, the ORTA board, by resolution, awarded a contract to the Dalton team for approximately $ 1,200,000.  On January 16, 1981, an ORTA employee hand-delivered an application for encumbrancy, accompanied by two copies of the contract, to the Office of Budget and Management for processing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 26, 1981, pursuant to the request of William D. Keip, the Director of the Office of Budget and Management, the Controlling Board met in special session and transferred the appropriations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of numerous state agencies for fiscal year 1981 into fiscal year 1980.  Among the sums so transferred was $ 1,288,245 from ORTA's account number 403.  This sum was then considered to have lapsed under R. C. 131.33, and the applied-for certification could not be given. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 30, 1981, Harry Meshel, a taxpayer of the state of Ohio and a member of the General Assembly, filed an action in this court seeking a writ of mandamus compelling Keip to certify the availability and adequacy of funds sufficient for the contract with the Dalton team.  On March 5, 1981, Meshel amended the complaint to include William W. Wilkins, the Director of Administrative Services, as a party.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Relator, a member of the General Assembly, sought a writ of mandamus compelling respondent state officials to certify the availability of funding for a contract for a rail transportation project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Funding was not certified for a contract because the Controlling Board had transferred rail transportation appropriations to a prior fiscal year, thereby causing them to lapse. A member of the General Assembly contended that the transfer was unlawful because legislative authority had been unconstitutionally delegated to the Board. The court held that the Board had effectively deappropriated funds without express legislative authority and granted the writ in part. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 127.17 restricted the Board's actions to those required to carry out legislative intent, appropriations for a current year could not be eliminated by transfer to a prior year. However, appropriations that had been carried forward from a prior year could be transferred back to the year of appropriation without violating the General Assembly's purposes. Legislative authority was not unconstitutionally delegated to the Board because &sect; 127.17 imposed restrictions on its ability to transfer funds. Neither the Board nor its actions violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 4, 27 because Board membership was not a public office forbidden to legislators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant-appellant, First National Bank of Ottawa, operates a bank in the village of Ottawa, Ohio, on property zoned B-2, central business district, designated pursuant to Ottawa Zoning Ordinance No. 944. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to provide expanded employee and customer parking, the bank negotiated an option to purchase Inlot No. 19, a parcel separated from the bank's property only by an alley.  Inlot No. 19 is located in an area zoned R-1, residential. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank applied for a variance to permit use of Inlot No. 19 as a parking lot.  The village clerk authorized the use by issuing a certificate of occupancy.  The bank thereupon bought and acquired title to Inlot No. 19. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, plaintiff-appellee, Eileen D. Schomaeker, a contiguous property owner in the R-1 residential area, filed an injuction action against the bank in case No. 77-104 in the Court of Common Pleas of Putnam County challenging the certificate of occupancy granted the bank for Inlot No. 19.  The court enjoined the bank from developing a parking lot on Inlot No. 19 until it could obtain a valid variance from the village of Ottawa Planning Commission.  Pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to this court order, the bank applied to the planning commission for a use variance.  After a public hearing attended by a number of interested citizens including plaintiff, the planning commission granted the use variance sought by the bank, making it subject to specific conditions involving landscaping, lighting and fencing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff then instituted the present action in the Court of Common Pleas, seeking a declaratory judgment holding the use variance granted by the planning commission void.  The court declared that the planning commission fully complied with the applicable zoning provisions in granting the use variance in question. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff then appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeals which, by a split decision, reversed the trial court.  It held that the grant of a use variance, in effect, constituted rezoning as a matter of law.  Such legislative action, the court decided, exceeded the authority of the planning commission to grant variances as provided by Section 402.3 of the zoning ordinance.  To authorize a use not permitted by the zoning ordinance would require legislative action by the village council. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant landowner filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to declare void a use variance appellee planning commission granted to appellee bank. The Court of Appeals for Putnam County (Ohio) reversed the trial court in holding that the commission exceeded its authority under Ottawa, Oh., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 402.3 in granting the use variance because such grant constituted rezoning. The commission and bank appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The bank applied for a use variance to use certain property as a parking lot. The landowner filed a suit against the bank to challenge the certificate of occupancy granted to it, and the trial court enjoined the bank from developing the lot until it obtained a valid variance from the commission. The landowner then filed a declaratory judgment action against the bank and commission. The court held (1) the commission effectively granted a use variance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.11, which allowed the city to delegate to the commission the power to grant variances; (2) the granting of the use variance was not rezoning, or an impermissible delegation of legislative power, but an exercise of administrative or quasi-judicial power and not inconsistent with Ottawa, Oh., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 402.3; (3) the landowner failed to exhaust administrative remedies under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01 in not appealing the granting of the use variance; and (4) the suit was barred by res judicata because the trial court's determination that the grant of a use variance, when the specified conditions existed, would allow the bank to construct the lot, barred relitigation of such issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. William E. Saunders, Jr., and Horizon House, plaintiffs-appellees, filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Clark County seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, the Clark County Zoning Department, appellant herein, John Houser, the zoning inspector, and others.  The issue raised was whether the foster care facility operated by plaintiffs for adjudicated delinquent boys was &quot;a family&quot; for zoning purposes, and therefore was legally located within an area zoned &quot;R-1 suburban residence district.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 4, 1978, plaintiff Saunders, an ordained minister of the Church of the Nazarene, obtained approval from the Ohio Youth Commission to use his residence at 2805 Fowler Road, Enon, Ohio, in Clark County, as a foster care facility for the treatment and rehabilitation of ten youths.  Plaintiff, and his wife and five children, lived at this residence together with as many as nine foster children placed by the youth commission at various times.  Plaintiff's home on Fowler Road was in area zoned &quot;R-1 suburban residence district.&quot; From January 1978 to October 1978, the Saunders had operated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a foster care facility at a farm in Cable, Ohio, in conjunction with the Fowler Road residence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1978, plaintiff's group home, Horizon House, was incorporated as a non-profit corporation.  Plaintiff and his wife also had been approved as foster parents by the Ohio Department of Public Welfare.  A few persons were hired to assist plaintiff and his wife to care for their foster children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's Fowler Road residence is a large two-story split level house containing seven bedrooms, four bathrooms, a living room, a dining room and a kitchen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Houser, the zoning inspector, testified that on October 20, 1978, he sent a letter to plaintiff to &quot;cease and desist&quot; operation of the foster home.  Following administrative and legal skirmishing between plaintiff and the zoning officials, Houser notified plaintiff by letter dated May 31, 1979, that he was operating a &quot;boarding house&quot; at his Fowler Road residence in an R-1 district in violation of the Clark County Zoning Resolution.  The inspector's letter also stated that if plaintiff wished to continue that operation he was required to apply for rezoning into an R-4 district. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, on June 8, 1979, filed the instant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief to enable them to continue operation of the Horizon House foster care home on Fowler Road. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court rendered judgment finding Horizon House to be a &quot;boarding house&quot;; that continued operation in an area zoned &quot;R-1 suburban residence district&quot; violated the Clark County Zoning Resolution; and that its permitted use was for an R-4 district.  Plaintiffs were denied the relief requested, and final judgment was rendered in favor of defendants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that &quot;[a] group of two or more children living together with foster parents as a single housekeeping unit constitutes a 'family' and is a permissible R-1 use under the express language of * * * [Subarticle] 4.18 of the zoning resolution of Clark County.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David W. Burch, petitioner herein, was charged by the Summit County Grand Jury in a 19-count indictment for his participation in an international narcotics smuggling and distribution operation.  After a trial, at which he was represented by counsel, a jury found petitioner guilty of engaging in organized crime, of four counts of conspiracy and of permitting drug abuse, in violation of R. C. 2923.04, 2923.01 and 2925.13, respectively.  The Court of Common Pleas sentenced petitioner to five to twenty-five years imprisonment for engaging in organized crime and to three to fifteen years for one count of conspiracy, the sentences to run consecutively.  Additionally, the court imposed a ten to twenty year sentence of imprisonment for the remaining three counts of conspiracy.  Finally, a six month jail sentence was imposed for the drug abuse offense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to a journal entry of the Court of Common Pleas, petitioner was committed to the Marion Correctional Institution, of which respondent herein is superintendent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's convictions for engaging in organized crime and permitting drug abuse, and reversed the convictions for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the conspiracy offenses.  In so doing, the Court of Appeals ruled that the conspiracy offenses merged with the conviction for engaging in organized crime, a violation of R. C. 2923.04. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner then prosecuted an appeal to this court (case No. 80-113), which reversed and remanded his case to the Court of Appeals for resolution of the issues in light of our decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner then brought this action seeking a writ of habeas corpus in this court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. He asserted that both the trial court and the court of appeals had abused their discretion in not granting his motion for bail pending the remand of his case to the court of appeals.

The court of appeals reversed petitioner's convictions on the conspiracy counts on the grounds that they merged with the conviction for engaging in organized crime. On further appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the court of appeals for resolution in light of its decision holding the organized crime statute unconstitutional. Petitioner argued that, because he had served the sentence for the drug abuse offense, he should be released. The court stated that, when it remanded a cause to the court of appeals for resolution in light of a recent ruling, the remand was not a final determination of the case. Rather, the judgment would only be final when disposed of by the court of appeals. The court also noted that the court of appeals might want to closely examine its ruling on the conspiracy counts and that the remand would not necessarily result in petitioner's release.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of this case, as stipulated by the parties, show that, from 1974 to November 1976, appellant lived at 337 Brown Street in Akron, Ohio.  Since that time, appellant has lived in various other places in the Akron area.  Appellant renewed his license on September 10, 1977.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bureau twice sent notice of the license suspension by certified mail to appellant at 337 Brown Street.  The notice of suspension was unclaimed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant continued driving through the period of suspension until October 29, 1979, when he was stopped by Akron police and charged with driving an unsafe vehicle.  He was also charged with driving on a suspended license. </SPAN></P>

The court noted that the constitutionality of a notice mechanism was dependent upon the likelihood of its ultimate success in notifying an interested party of a pending action. A method for providing notice had to be reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.40(K) required that notice by the registrar be sent to the last known address of the licensee. However, the licensee had the obligation to supply his last known address. A letter mailed to an incorrect address supplied by the driver constituted neglect on his part.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1977, appellant, Board of Education of the Marion City School District, requested the transfer to its district of certain parcels of land previously annexed to the city from three adjacent school districts, Pleasant, River Valley, and Elgin locals.  The boards of education of these districts are designated appellees herein.  R. C. 3311.06 requires the approval of appellee Ohio State Board of Education (state board) of any such transfer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, application for this transfer was made to the state board which, at the request of appellees, appointed a referee to conduct hearings on the matter pursuant to R.

Objections to the referee's report and recommendations were filed and thereafter, on March 12, 1979, the state board disapproved the transfer of any of the requested territory. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 29, 1978, intervening appellee, Ohio Edison Company (company), filed with appellee Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (commission), notices of intent to file applications for rate increases.  In the notices of intent, the company requested that the 12 months ending September 30, 1979, be established as the test period and that March 31, 1979, serve as the date certain.  The commission, by entries dated January 30, 1979, approved the requested test period and date certain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company filed the applications </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the commission on April 2, 1979, which were accepted on May 23, 1979.  On July 12, 1979, the commission granted appellant, Office of Consumers' Counsel (appellant), leave to intervene in the proceedings. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;The company filed two applications with the commission.  One application, 78-1567-EL-AIR, involved a rate increase for the company's urban customers.  The other, 78-1568-EL-AIR, involved a rate increase for the company's rural customers.  The cases were heard as one before the commission, and have been so treated by the parties to this appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the commission's staff conducted an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  investigation on the company's applications and filed a written report with the commission on the investigation.  Appellant timely filed objections to the staff's report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public hearings were commenced on November 7, 1979, and concluded on December 17, 1979.  On January 30, 1980, the commission issued its opinion and order, from which this appeal is prosecuted.  The portion of the order relevant to this appeal permitted the inclusion of approximately $ 125.5 million in the company's rate base as an allowance for construction work in progress (CWIP).  The greatest portion of this amount represented a CWIP allowance for the construction of a coal-fired generating plant, Bruce Mansfield Unit No. 3, the third of three coal-fired generating plants which have been constructed by a consortium of power companies including Ohio Edison. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant timely filed an application for rehearing which was denied in part and granted in part by the commission.  The commission denied that portion of appellant's application for rehearing relating to the allowance of CWIP. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant consumer advocate sought review of a decision by appellee Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which authorized a rate increase sought by a public utility company that included an allowance for construction work in progress. The advocate argued that the Commission improperly applied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.15(A)(1) and improperly applied the Commission's own requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Commission determined that one of the facilities being built by the company was 75 percent complete based upon a physical inspection, an elapsed time test, and a dollars obligated test. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.15(A)(1), the Commission determined that the company was entitled to an allowance for the construction work in progress. On appeal, the court concluded that &sect; 4909.15(A)(1) did not require the Commission to determine the percentage of completion based upon a physical examination only. The court found that &sect; 4909.15(A)(1) permitted the Commission to make an allowance based upon the extent to which a particular construction project was complete on a pro rata basis with other portions of an entire facility. The court determined that the Commission did not have rigid criteria for determining when an allowance for construction work in progress became effective. There was no requirement that the Commission only authorize an allowance for construction work in progress after a facility became operational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, David L. Brown, owns an 8,040 square foot lot located on the northeast corner of East 117th Street and St. Clair Avenue in the city of Cleveland.  Although this property is situated in an area which is zoned for local retail use and, therefore, an area where the operation of the gasoline service station is a prohibited use, appellant legally operates a gasoline service station thereon as a valid pre-existing, non-conforming use. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Section 359.01 of the Cleveland Zoning Code provides: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Existing Nonconforming Buildings and Uses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(a) Except as provided in Section 347.06 and Chapter 351, a use of building or land lawfully existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code or of any amendment or supplement thereto, or for which a permit has been lawfully issued, may be continued even though such use does not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code for the use district in which it is located, but no enlargement or expansion shall be permitted except as a variance under the terms of Chapter 329, and no substitution or other change in such nonconforming use to other than a conforming use shall be permitted except by special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals.  Such special permit may be issued only if the Board finds after public hearing that such substitution or other change is no more harmful or objectionable than the previous nonconforming use in floor or other space occupied, in volume of trade or production, in kind of goods sold or produced, in daily hours or other period of use, in the type or number of persons to occupy or to be attracted to the premises or in any other characteristic of the new use as compared with the previous use. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant, having decided to diversify and expand his business, applied for a permit which would enable him to convert part of this gasoline service station into a grocery store, a permitted use, and to operate this structure in the dual capacity of a gasoline service station and a grocery store.  The commissioner of buildings refused to issue the permit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to the denial of a permit, appellant made the appropriate structural alterations to the gasoline service station and did, in fact, begin to operate the building as both a gasoline service station and a grocery store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant unsuccessfully sought a variance from the board of zoning appeals.  In refusing to grant the requested variance, the board of zoning appeals found, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that appellant's dual use of the property was in violation of the accessory off-street parking requirements of what is now Section 349.04 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the Cleveland Zoning Code. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;The board of zoning appeals also found that the gasoline service station-grocery store combination violated Sections 343.13 and 355.03 of the Cleveland Zoning Code. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 355.03 provides: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;No yard, open space or lot area provided for any building or group of buildings for the purposes of complying with the requirements of this Zoning Code shall be reduced or again considered as the yard, open space or lot area required for any other building or additional construction on the same lot or on another lot.

The judge, apparently attempting to avoid a rote repetition of the testimony which had been elicited at the hearing of the board of zoning appeals, granted appellant's motion to introduce additional evidence but restricted this additional evidence to evidence which, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered and produced at the previous hearing.  At the conclusion of the proceedings in the trial court, the judge affirmed the board of zoning appeals' refusal to grant the variance. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The owner wanted to add a grocery store to his gas station. The commissioner of buildings, the board of zoning appeals, the trial court, and the court of appeals each found that the grocery store's new venture required additional parking, which the owner failed to prove he could safely accommodate. On review, the owner argued that: (1) his property was immune from governmental regulation because he was adding a permitted use to a non-conforming use; (2) the trial court committed reversible error by suppressing allegedly relevant, probative evidence; and (3) he was unconstitutionally denied equal protection of the law because the city permitted similarly-situated property owners to operate gasoline service stations and grocery stores at one site. The court held that: (1) the non-conforming use was not immune from compliance with the parking requirements of Cleveland, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 349.04(f), so the new use would not be immune either; (2) the owner experienced no prejudice from the exclusion of the evidence; and (3) the city had a legitimate reason for requiring the restrictions and the owner's evidence was insufficient to show any equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 15, 1978, Charles Burdsall, a police officer for the city of Cincinnati, was shot and killed after he stopped a vehicle and approached it to investigate an alleged attempted robbery.  David Mellon, a civilian riding with the police officer in an auxiliary capacity, was also wounded in the incident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 21, 1978, the Hamilton County Grand Jury indicted Wayne Reed, charging him with three counts of aggravated murder in violation of R. C. 2903.01, attempted murder in violation of R. C. 2903.02, escape in violation of R. C. 2921.34, and aggravated robbery in violation of R. C. 2911.01.  The first count of aggravated murder charged that Reed had caused Burdsall's death while escaping; the second count charged that he had caused the death of Burdsall while fleeing immediately after attempting to commit an aggravated robbery; and the third count charged that he had purposely caused the death of Burdsall with prior calculation and design.  On July 22, 1978, Reed was arrested in Cleveland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was tried to a jury beginning on October 16, 1978.  At trial, David Hamler, a Cincinnati police officer, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that at approximately midnight on July 14, 1978, while off duty, he drove to a King Kwik store to make a purchase.  As he drove into the parking lot at the side of the store, he noticed a late 1960's Chevrolet parked in the lot with a man seated behind the steering wheel.  The officer then parked his car in the front lot, exited his vehicle and approached the front door of the store.  He then noticed a man, whom he identified as Wayne Reed, at a pay phone next to the front window of the store.  He testified that Reed was holding the telephone receiver and was acting as if he was talking into it, but that he was, in fact, peering into the store at a clerk who was counting money.  Hamler stated that Reed was not actually talking on the phone because the mouthpiece was away from his mouth and he was talking too quietly to be heard.  He testified that there was no indication that Reed was carrying a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamler went into the store, identified himself to the clerk, and asked the clerk to call the police department because he believed a robbery was in progress.  The clerk made the call and Hamler spoke to a police officer.  Shortly thereafter Officer Robert Plum arrived in a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  marked police car.  As Plum arrived, Reed hung up the phone, walked around the corner of the building, and got into the Chevrolet which immediately drove off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Burdsall then pulled up in a marked police car, and after a brief conversation with Hamler, drove off in pursuit of the Chevrolet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Mellon testified that he and Burdsall pursued the Chevrolet out of the lot and stopped it; that he and Burdsall got out of the police car with Burdsall having drawn his gun; that they walked up to the Chevrolet and Burdsall ordered the occupants out of the car; and that the driver then got out of the car, turned around, and proceeded to shoot three times at Burdsall and twice at Mellon.  Mellon identified the driver as Wayne Reed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only evidence offered by the prosecution of prior calculation and design, excepting evidence regarding the shooting itself, was a statement Reed made to a person who had been in an auto body repair class with him approximately a month before Burdsall's death that &quot;if a cop got in his way [during a robbery] he would blow him away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the trial the prosecution called Barbara Brown, Reed's fiancee, as a witness.  After the court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  refused to declare her a hostile witness, the prosecutor questioned her regarding conversations she had with Reed following the shooting.  When her answers conflicted with those made to a police officer shortly after the shooting, the prosecutor moved the court to allow him to use the statements to refresh her recollection on the ground that he had been surprised by the conflicting testimony.  The court permitted the prosecutor to read the statements to Brown who then had an opportunity to explain them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 1, 1978, the jury found Reed guilty as charged on all counts of the indictment.  On January 18, 1979, the court sentenced Reed to death on each of the three counts of aggravated murder which were to be served concurrently, to seven to twenty-five years each for the felonies of attempted murder and aggravated robbery to be served consecutively with each other and the death sentences, and to two to five years for the escape to be served consecutively with the other sentences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Reed argued (1) that the death sentences should be commuted to life sentences because the Ohio death penalty had been held unconstitutional; (2) that the trial court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had erred in allowing Officer Hamler to state that he believed a robbery was occurring; (3) that the court had erred in allowing the prosecutor to read Barbara Brown's prior statements into the record; (4) that the trial court had erred in allowing the conviction of defendant on the three counts of aggravated murder; (5) that the guilty verdicts were contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence; and (6) that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences on the felonies underlying the two aggravated murder convictions based on those felonies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reduced the death sentences to life imprisonment and reversed the imposition of sentences on all three aggravated murder convictions, remanding the case to the trial court with instructions to choose one aggravated murder offense upon which sentencing should be ordered.  The court affirmed the trial court in all other respects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed to this court, reasserting the assignments which the Court of Appeals held to be without merit.  The state cross-appealed the reversal and remand of the imposition of the sentences on the three counts of aggravated murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the allowance of a motion and cross-motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Judgment accordingly</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant, who was convicted of three counts of aggravated murder under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01, attempted murder under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.02, escape under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.34, and aggravated robbery under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01, appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which reduced his death sentences to life imprisonment and remanded for resentencing. The State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant killed a police officer who pursued and stopped him after he peered in the window of a store. On appeal, the court considered whether there was evidence of prior calculation and design, an element of aggravated murder. The court held that general statements that defendant made a month earlier were insufficient to show prior calculation and design. The court also held that the act of peering into a store window at a clerk counting money did not constitute an attempt to commit a theft offense, which was an essential element of aggravated robbery, without a showing of a purpose to deprive the store owner of property. The court also found that the officer did not have control over defendant, so the evidence may have shown the misdemeanor of resisting arrest, but not the felony of escape. The court noted that the evidence clearly supported a finding of murder and that murder was a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder. The court exercised its authority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.79(D) and Ohio R. Crim. P. 33(A)(4) to modify the verdict to convict defendant of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed defendant's convictions for aggravated robbery and escape, reduced the conviction of three counts of aggravated murder to one count of murder, and affirmed the conviction for attempted murder. The court modified the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal by Clint L. Byrd, appellant herein, from the denial of his complaint in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">quo warranto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and mandamus by the Court of Appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts, in essence, giving rise to this appeal, are as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the general election conducted on November 6, 1979, Byrd and William C. Wetzel were candidates, together with six others, for the Norton City School District Board of Education -- two members to be elected.  The election results showed, in part, that Jean L. Behr received 1,671 votes, Wetzel received 1,397 votes, and Byrd received 1,259 votes.  Since only two candidates were to be elected, the board of elections declared Behr and Wetzel the winners, and, on November 20, 1979, issued certificates of election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 19, 1979, Byrd went to the board of elections to file his financial report and while there decided to review the computer print-out of the election results.  Byrd became concerned about the accuracy of the print-out results in that he had only received eight votes in his own precinct, which he felt was incorrect.  Upon contacting the deputy director of the board of elections, the ballots in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Byrd's home precinct were examined and it was determined that there had indeed been an error in tallying the votes, occasioned by an improper code number being key-punched into the board of elections computer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon an informal hand count of the votes in the precinct in question, the vote totals were as follows: Behr, 1,604, Byrd, 1,411, and Wetzel, 1,371. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Byrd thereafter brought a complaint in the Court of Appeals seeking, upon the basis of the total votes as determined by the hand count, a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to withdraw the certificate of election issued to Wetzel and issue such certificate to Byrd, and further, by an action in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">quo warranto,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenging Wetzel's right to hold office.  The court denied the complaint. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Judgment affirmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant candidate challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which denied his complaint for mandamus seeking to compel appellee board of elections to withdraw the certificate of election issued to the declared winner and issue such a certificate to the candidate and in quo warranto challenging the declared winner's right to hold office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The candidate was one of several candidates for two positions on the board of education. The election results showed that two other persons received more votes than the candidate and the board of elections declared them the winners. Thereafter, it was discovered that there had been an error in the tallying of the votes in the candidate's home precinct and, pursuant to an informal tally, the candidate had more votes than the declared winner. He brought a complaint seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to withdraw the certification of election issued to the declared winner and issue a certificate to the candidate. He further challenged the declared winner's right to hold office. The lower court denied the relief requested and the court affirmed. It found that subsequent to the election, the candidate could have either sought a recount or filed an election contest had he reviewed the election results within 15 days after they were declared, rather than six weeks later. By his failure to act within the prescribed statutory periods provided by law, the court concluded that he forfeited his right to relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court, which denied defendant's request for an order to compel the board of elections to declare him the winner and his action in quo warranto challenging the declared winner's right to hold office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By letter dated September 15, 1978, Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio (hereinafter &quot;Blue Cross&quot;) filed a request with the Department of Insurance for a rate increase for its non-group subscriber contracts.  Hearings on the increase were conducted for eight days in October and November of 1978, pursuant to R. C. 1739.051(D). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing officer, finding that Blue Cross had failed to demonstrate a total good faith effort to contain costs, determined that the proposed rate increase was only partially lawful, fair and reasonable.  As a result, he recommended that the proposal be reduced by 20 percent.  On December 1, 1978, the Superintendent of Insurance issued an order in accordance with the hearing officer's report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blue Cross appealed the order to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.  On February 21, 1979, the court granted Blue Cross' motion for final judgment apparently based on the decision of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Blue Cross of Northwest Ohio </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Jump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (January 25, 1979, Case No. 78AP-450), unreported.  In that case, the Court of Appeals had held that if any good faith effort&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was shown, the entire requested rate increase had to be granted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 18, 1979, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Court of Common Pleas on the basis of that earlier decision. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant superintendent of insurance sought review of the decision from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which affirmed a decision granting final judgment to appellee insurer in its action to overturn a decision of a hearing officer that granted the insurer only a partial rate increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The insurer filed for a rate increase, and a hearing officer granted a partial increase on the basis that proposed increase was only partially lawful, fair, and reasonable in that the insurer had not provided a good faith effort to establish the entire increase. The insurer sought judicial review of the decision, and the trial court granted judgment in favor of the insurer. The appellate court affirmed the decision, and the superintendent challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and held that an all or nothing increase was not required. The superintendent had the authority pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1739.051 to grant partial rate increases based on a finding of partial good faith, which did not involve an unlawful delegation of authority. The statute provided sufficient guidance and standards, and judicial review was available in a meaningful way. The evidence showed that the insurer did not meet the required good faith effort standard in all areas. The superintendent's determination did not apply new standards in violation of the insurer's due process rights and was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the insurer that reversed a determination by the superintendent that provided that the insurer was only entitled to a partial rate increase.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mable McCruter, appellee herein, was discharged by her employer, White-Westinghouse Corporation, and filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits.  The claim was disallowed by the Administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services.  Upon reconsideration, the administrator affirmed his earlier decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellee timely appealed that decision, and a hearing was held before a referee of the Board of Review.  The referee affirmed the administrator's decision.  According to a certificate of mailing signed by Kathy Watson, the referee's decision was mailed to the appellee on April 13, 1978. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 2, 1978, the appellee filed an application to institute further appeal from the decision of the referee with the Board of Review.  The Board of Review held a hearing to determine whether the appellee's application was timely filed.  At that hearing the appellee testified that she called the Bureau of Employment Services on April 27, 1978, to inquire about the status of her case.  It was not until the next day, April 28, 1978, that she received a copy of the referee's decision.  There was no evidence, other than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the certificate of mailing, as to when the referee's decision was mailed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Review dismissed the appellee's application to institute further appeal.  It found that the application was filed more than 14 days after the decision was mailed, contrary to the requirement of R. C. 4141.28(L). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That decision was appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County.  The Court of Common Pleas affirmed the decision of the Board of Review. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed.  In reversing, the court held that the certificate of mailing is not dispositive of claims relating to the adequacy of notice to the appellee. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 6, 1978, a verified complaint was filed against James Olin in the Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division by Martin Nagle, the Attendance Officer of the Richland County Public Schools.  The complaint alleged that James Olin was in violation of the Ohio compulsory education law ( R. C. 3321.38) in that he failed to send his child, Jennifer Olin, a child of compulsory school age, to a school which conforms to minimum standards prescribed by the State Board of Education.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Knox County (Ohio), which confirmed a decision finding him guilty of a violation of the state compulsory education law for failing to send his daughter to a school that conformed to minimum standards prescribed by the state board of education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant was found guilty of failing to send his child to a state-approved school. He appealed and the appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. He appealed again, arguing that his prosecution was discriminatory, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The court held that defendant failed to prove that the fact that he held nonconforming religious beliefs in any way motivated the State to charge him. Defendant contended that the State had to permit him to send his child to an Amish school as an incident of his right to freely exercise his religion and his right to direct the upbringing and education of his child. The court observed that certain aspects of the board's minimum standards came into direct conflict with defendant's religious beliefs and interfered with the free exercise of his religion. The court held that, until the board adopted minimum standards which went no further than necessary to assure the State's legitimate interests in the education of children in private elementary schools, the balance was weighted in favor of a First Amendment claim to religious freedom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, James H. Holmes, was separated from his employment with appellee, Union Gospel Press, on February 17, 1978.  Appellant filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits with the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 29, 1978, a &quot;determination of application for benefit rights&quot; was mailed by the bureau to appellant informing him that his claim for benefits was disallowed because Union Gospel had not elected to be covered by the Ohio unemployment insurance laws.  Appellant requested reconsideration, and it is undisputed that on April 14, 1978, the administrator of the bureau mailed his decision on reconsideration to appellant's last known post office address.  It appears from the record that appellant did not receive the decision in the mail but learned of it after contacting the unemployment office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 3, 1978, appellant filed a notice of appeal with the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 1, 1978, the appellee, James M. Pachay, was arrested on a warrant issued by the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Lake County charging him with non-support in violation of R. C. 2919.21, a misdemeanor of the first degree.  The appellee appeared for arraignment, entered a plea of not guilty and was released on bond.

The appellant, state of Ohio, conceded that the appellee was not brought to trial within the time limits of R. C. 2945.71, but contested the motion to dismiss on the sole ground that R.

The right of an accused to a speedy trial was recognized by the constitutions of Ohio and the United States. The court noted that throughout the long history of litigation that involved the application of the speedy trial statutes, it had repeatedly announced that the trial courts were to strictly enforce the legislative mandates evident in the speedy trial statutes. Strict enforcement of the speedy trial statutes was grounded in the conclusion that they implemented the constitutional guarantee of a public speedy trial. The court chose to enforce the mandate of the present speedy trial statutes in the belief that &sect; 2945.71 represented a rational effort to enforce the constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael H. Willcox is an officer of the Kettering Police Department.  At approximately 3:00 a.m. on September 23, 1978, Willcox, while on duty in his marked patrol car, was proceeding northbound on South Smithville Road in Kettering.  He observed a pickup truck in his rear view mirror, overtaking him at a high rate of speed.  The officer pulled into a center leftturn lane, allowing the pickup to go past him.  Willcox estimated its speed to be in excess of 50 miles per hour at that time, more than 15 miles per hour over the posted speed limit.  As the officer gave chase, he observed the truck weaving across three lanes of the five-lane roadway, and once even hitting the curb.  At one point during the chase, the drive of the truck fell over to his right, disappearing from the officer's view for &quot;a second or two,&quot; then reappearing as he sat back up.  Willcox then determined to stop the pickup, and turned on the cruiser emergency lights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the vehicles came to an intersection, the pickup slowed very rapidly and made a left turn, running a traffic light in the process.  Willcox followed, and turned on the cruiser's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  siren.  The chase continued for three more blocks, at which point the truck suddenly came to a stop in the middle of the westbound lane on Watervliet Avenue at its intersection with Mondail Avenue.  This intersection is within the corporate limits of Dayton.  The record does not disclose where the vehicles entered Dayton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the officer walked toward the pickup, the defendant, Jeffrey L. Hollen, got out of the truck and staggered for a moment before catching ahold of the side of the truck.  The defendant was unable to produce his driver's license, and failed the field sobriety tests administered to him by the officer.  Willcox took the defendant into custody, and charged him with one count of failure to drive in a single lane, and one count of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.  At a trial to the bench in the Kettering Municipal Court, the defendant was convicted and sentenced on both counts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions, holding the extraterritorial warrantless arrest of the defendant in Dayton by a Kettering police officer to be illegal, and the evidence obtained by such an arrest inadmissible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Kettering police officer noticed defendant speeding and driving erratically. He attempted to stop defendant and a chase ensued. The chase ended in Dayton and defendant failed the field sobriety tests. Defendant was convicted of failure to drive in a single lane and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The court reversed the decision of the appellate court and found that the record was insufficient as to the factual of issue of whether the arresting process commenced while the Kettering police officer and defendant were still in Kettering. Therefore, the court assumed that defendant's arrest in Dayton was not authorized. However, the court determined that the fruits of defendant's arrest, based on probable cause but unauthorized, were not suppressible solely because of the fact of the arrest in Dayton by a Kettering police officer. The court reasoned that defendant was not immune from prosecution merely because of the fact that his arrest was unlawful or unauthorized. The court found that the issue was whether inadmissible evidence was used to convict defendant and that defendant's conviction was not the result of the use of inadmissible evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instant cause arose from a complaint filed in the Court of Common Pleas by Sidney Stromberg, appellant herein, as a taxpayer and resident of the village of Bratenahl, challenging the dissolution and merger on July 1, 1970, of the Bratenahl School District with the Cleveland School District and the constitutionality of R. C. 3311.29, and praying for injunctive relief with respect to the order of merger and the transfer of property and funds.  The transfer of the property, assets and management of Bratenahl School District has been completed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dissolution of the Bratenahl School District and its merger on July 1, 1970, has had an extensive and protracted history of litigation in this court and in the federal courts.  The controversy involved the efforts of the Bratenahl School District to preserve its independent identity despite its failure to maintain a school system consisting of grades one through twelve, inclusive, as required by R. C. 3311.29. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">State, ex rel. Bd. of Edn., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. State Bd. of Edn</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 173, certiorari denied, 439 U.S. 865, the Bratenahl board of education challenged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the state's final order of dissolution.  In upholding the validity of the order, the majority opinion concluded, at page 178, &quot;that the Bratenahl Local School District was properly dissolved on July 1, 1970, by the state board.&quot; Seeking to stop this dissolution, the board of education then filed a complaint in prohibition and mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.  Citing the above decision of this court, the Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">sua sponte,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by finding that the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Bratenahl</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.

(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 189. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing the issues in terms of denials of equal protection and due process under the Constitution of the United States, the Bratenahl board of education, joined by individual taxpayers and students, then asserted the same issues in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  The District Court dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Court that the Ohio litigation fully and completely disposed of all claims, and affirmed the dismissal. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Wilt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">.

Bd. of Elections,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 61 Ohio St. 2d 298, decided March 12, 1980.  While this case involved the eligibility of a resident and elector of the village of Bratenahl to be a candidate for the Cuyahoga County Board of Education, the initial question raised was whether the Bratenahl Local School District had been dissolved.  This court stated, at page 299, as follows: &quot;A review of these cases shows that the status of the Bratenahl School District has been established and the same was dissolved on July 1, 1970, and the issue is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; Further, on page 300, it was noted that &quot;[i]n </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Wilt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Bd. of Edn., supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the federal circuit court also found this issue to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; The candidate argued that the Bratenahl controversy was still alive because the constitutionality of R. C. 3311.29 was under attack in the instant case, then pending in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.  This court stated that this rationale for qualifying the Bratenahl issue as viable is tenuous at best, and that an allegation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of unconstitutionality of a statute in a case pending in a lower court is not justification for overturning a determination twice made by this court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellees herein, State Board of Education and Cleveland Board of Education, filed motions to dismiss based upon the earlier decisions of this court that the judgment in the action between the State Board of Education and the Bratenahl board of education was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as to appellant's complaint.

The taxpayer argued that as a taxpayer he had a private right, independent of the local board of education, to relitigate the same public issue determined against the local school board. Upon review, the Court determined that this could be true where cause of action were not the same or where the taxpayer had a different private right not shared in common with the public. However, the judgment against the local school board with binding and conclusive as res judicata on all residents, citizens, and taxpayers with respect to matters adjudicated which were of general and public interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases were initiated by the state of Ohio, appellant herein, which filed separate complaints in Chardon Municipal Court, charging the appellees, Kirt S.

C. 1533.161 prohibits, in part, the throwing or casting of the &quot;rays of a spotlight or other artificial light from any vehicle into any field, woodland, or forest for the purpose of locating a wild animal.&quot; The complaints alleged that, on November 26, 1978, while in Geauga County, the appellees cast the rays of a spotlight from a motor vehicle into a woodland for the purpose of locating deer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before trial the appellees filed motions to dismiss, asserting that the portion of R. C. 1533.161, under which they were charged, is unconstitutional.  There was no evidence taken by the trial court, nor were any stipulations of fact entered into by the parties.  However, the trial court did have before it the materials constituting the legislative history of the statute in question, including the Legislative Service Commission summaries of Am. Sub. S.B.

The appellate court affirmed the judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. The court found that there was a reasonable basis for the general assembly to determine that the elimination of all spotlighting of wild game from vehicles would be in the best interests and furtherance of the protection of the wild animals of the State, and that it was within the province of the general assembly to enact laws for the protection of wild game.

<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;The Tuscarawas County prosecutor's reaction to the seizure of a stolen stereo set and several other items at a New Philadelphia apartment by Jerry Dupler, Dover councilman and a private eye, is somewhat surprising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Prosecutor Ron Collins indicated there would not be any prosecution because of 'a lack of criminal intent.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Private investigators, under Ohio law, must inform authorities 12 hours in advance of participation in a case.  The prosecutor revealed he had been contacted about a search warrant the night Dupler, acting in behalf of Brad Dinolfo, made the seizure.  However, the prosecutor said he didn't think police had 'sufficient justification' for a warrant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;The prosecutor's office, we are certain, prosecutes numerous cases wherein 'criminal intent' is not evident.  J. C. Shew, an assistant prosecutor, added that their office isn't concerned that Dupler, employed by Cloverleaf Security, had not informed police of his intentions.  Nor is the prosecutor's office concerned over the fact that Dupler did not have a search warrant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;It seems to us that Dupler, if he is qualified as a licensed private investigator, ignored Ohio law twice -- by not giving authorities the proper notification and then by making a seizure without a search warrant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;It is proper to ask, in view of the circumstances, what the intent was behind Dupler's actions.  It also is proper to ask if the prosecutor's office is politically motivated in its unconcern. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;If Jerry Dupler is going to continue his work as a private eye the prosecutor's office should at least make certain he refrains in the future from ignoring Ohio statutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The record indicates that appellant notified Dover and New Philadelphia police on March 25, 1975, of his involvement in the case and his intent to recover a stolen stereo from a local apartment.  Police declined to assist Dupler because they lacked a search warrant.  Dupler and his client evidently received the consent of a man at the apartment to conduct a search, although it was never determined whether this individual actually was a resident of the premises.  Dupler and his client recovered the stereo and other property which they turned over to police at the scene. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Articles appearing in the April 4 and April 8, 1975, editions of The Times-Reporter described the reactions of the New Philadelphia police chief and the local prosecutor's office to Dupler's unorthodox tactics in this matter, and the prosecutor's decision not to charge Dupler with violating state law in his method of intervention.  Yockey's subsequent editorial criticized this decision not to prosecute.  Appellant's defamation suit ensued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment which was overruled.  At trial, plaintiff presented evidence that defendant failed to comply with R. C. 2739.13&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and 2739.14, in printing an editorial retraction submitted by plaintiff in August 1975.  At the close of plaintiff's case-in-chief and at the close of all evidence, defendant moved for a directed verdict in his favor, on the basis that plaintiff had not met his burden of proving that the allegedly libelous comments were made with actual malice.  Both such motions were effectively overruled.  The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $ 149,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed and entered judgment for defendant.  It found that the trial court erred in not granting defendant's motions for summary judgment and directed verdict, because there was no evidence presented that Yockey knew, at the time of publication, that his comments were false or, in fact, entertained serious doubts as to their truth.  The appellate court also found that R. C. 2739.13 and 2739.14, the so-called &quot;retraction statutes,&quot; were unconstitutional as infringing upon defendant's First Amendment rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Plaintiff public official appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Tuscarawas County (Ohio), reversing the trial court's denial of defendant newspaper's motions for summary judgment and for directed verdict in the official's libel action and finding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2739.13 and 2739.14, the &quot;retraction statutes,&quot; unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The newspaper printed an editorial alleging that the official, a private investigator, city councilman, and mayoral candidate, had ignored Ohio law by failing to inform police that he was going to seize certain property and seizing the property without a warrant. The official had, in fact, notified police, and there had allegedly been consent for the search. The court held that, under the &quot;actual malice&quot; standard, the official failed to show that the newspaper acted with reckless disregard of the falsity of the publication. The editor relied on prior articles, and it was insufficient for the official to show that the editor's interpretation was false without showing the editor's awareness of the high probability of falsity. The editor had no reason to doubt the accuracy of statutory interpretations and drew one of several permissible legal conclusions from sketchy facts. The trial court committed prejudicial error by admitting evidence of the newspaper's failure to retract in conformance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2739.13 and 2739.14. Sections 2739.13 and 2739.14 were irrelevant to the issue of malice, and the appellate court erred in determining their constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment finding that the newspaper was entitled to summary judgment, but reversed the finding that the &quot;retraction statutes&quot; were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 8, 1969, appellee, Fred W. Felske (claimant), suffered an injury to his back during the course of his employment with the city of Columbus, Health Department.  Felske's claim for medical expenses relative to his injury was allowed and paid by the Bureau of Workers' Compensation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the next six years, claimant neither applied for nor received compensation pursuant to R. C. 4123.56, 4123.57 or 4123.58, even though it is stipulated that he had several periods of temporary total disability during this time relative to the injury, for which the claimant requested and was paid sick-leave benefits by his employer in an amount equal to the wages he would have received had he worked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 18, 1977, claimant filed with appellant Industrial Commission an application for determination of the percentage of permanent partial disability.  A subsequent commission order refused this application on the basis that, in the absence of payment of compensation, the commission lacked jurisdiction under R. C. 4123.52 to consider this claim after six years from the date of injury.  The order was affirmed by the Court of Common&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pleas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals, however, found the construction of R. C. 4123.52 adopted by the commission to be unconstitutional, as applied to the instant situation, in that it denied appellee equal protection of the law.  In order to avoid an unconstitutional application, that court &quot;liberally construed&quot; this statute so as to equate &quot;payment of compensation for total disability&quot; with the payment of sick-leave benefits in an amount equal to wages.  The Court of Appeals, therefore, reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded the cause for a determination of whether claimant sustained sufficient periods of temporary total disability as a result of his injury, for which he was paid sick-leave benefits, in order to invoke the continuing jurisdiction of the commission for &quot;ten years from the date of the last payment of compensation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant Workers Compensation Commission challenged an order of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which found the Commission's construction of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.52 to be unconstitutional as applied to appellee worker, reversing the trial court's judgment. It remanded for a determination of whether the worker had sufficient periods of temporary total disability from his injury to invoke the Commission's continuing jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The worker was allowed medical expenses for a work injury. During the next six years, he did not apply for compensation although he had several periods of temporary total disability from the injury, for which his employer paid him sick-leave benefits. The worker applied for permanent partial disability but the commission found it lacked jurisdiction. The court held that the Commission properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the application after six years from the date of injury. However, this construction of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.52, as applied to the worker, violated equal protection because it classified workers on the basis of whether they received disability compensation within six years of the injury. A worker who was paid compensation could apply for modification any time within 10 years after the last payment. A worker who was only reimbursed for medical expenses was foreclosed from seeking additional compensation six years after his injury. It was arbitrary to determine a worker's entitlement to invoke the Commission's continuing jurisdiction on the basis of whether he received remuneration for that disability from his employer or from the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the judgment, as modified, and remanded the cause to the Commission for consideration of the worker's application for determination of the percentage of permanent partial disability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 25, 1980, the Governor of Ohio signed into law Am. Sub. S. B. No. 13 which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> created a new judicial seat on the Fifth District Court of Appeals (&quot;new seat&quot;).  On July 31, Judge David D. Dowd, Jr., resigned his position as a Fifth District Court of Appeals judge (&quot;unexpired seat&quot;).  At the November 4 general election, a candidate will be elected to fill the new seat, as well as a candidate to fill the term of the unexpired seat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 6, Irene Smart filed her petitions with the Stark County Board of Elections for the new seat.  On the same day, Donald R. Ramsayer filed his petitions as an independent candidate for the unexpired seat.  On August 13, the board of elections approved and certified Smart and four other candidates for the new seat, but rejected Ramsayer's petitions.  The justification for the rejection of Ramsayer's petitions was R. C. 3513.31, which provides the procedure for filling the vacancy for the unexpired seat.  That section permits committees of political parties to select candidates to run in the general election to fill the unexpired term of the person who has resigned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, Ramsayer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed suit in United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, seeking an order that he be placed on the ballot for the unexpired seat.  (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ramsayer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Celebrezze, Jr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. [case No. C-2-80-732].) On September 9, Smart withdrew her candidacy for the new seat, which the board of elections unanimously voted to accept on September 12.  On September 22, District Court Judge Robert M. Duncan issued his decision in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ramsayer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Celebrezze, Jr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (unreported).  Judge Duncan held R. C. 3513.31&nbsp;unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded Ramsayer from running for the unexpired seat as an independent candidate.  Accordingly, Ramsayer's name was ordered to be placed on the ballot for the unexpired seat.  On September 23, the board of elections certified Ramsayer as a candidate for the unexpired seat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 25, Smart, a Democrat, filed petitions of candidacy as an independent for the unexpired seat.  On the same day, several electors brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County seeking injunctive relief to keep Smart off the ballot.  On September 26, the board of elections voted unanimously to place Smart on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ballot for the unexpired seat.  On October 9, Judge Gary McKinley, respondent herein, visiting judge on the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, issued a permanent restraining order enjoining the Secretary of State and the board of elections from printing the name of Smart on the ballot for the unexpired seat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 9, Smart and the board of elections filed this original action seeking, in effect, an order to place Smart on the ballot for the unexpired seat.  On October 15, relators' motion to suspend the injunction pending disposition of this action was sustained. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Candidates were to be elected to fill a new seat and an unexpired seat.

Petitioner later withdrew her candidacy and sought candidacy as an independent for the unexpired seat. The judge enjoined the board from printing petitioner's name, claiming that she did not timely file. However, in the case brought by the independent candidate, the federal district court had held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3515.31, insofar as it forbade the placing of independents on the ballot, was unconstitutional. The judge held that at the least the 65-day limitation contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3513.30, the statute regarding candidate withdrawal, had to be used. The court prohibited the injunction. The period of limitation was not clear. The office holder vacated the unexpired office 40 days before the election. Thus, the 65-day period did not apply. The problem of the applicable and pertinent time limitations for the filing of an independent candidacy was to be determined by the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 11, 1977, Robert and Bonnie Peebles filed a complaint against Betty Ann Clement, her daughter Kimberly, and defendants' bank, alleging that Betty was indebted to them in excess of $ 4,000, as a result of her failure to account for funds collected while she was employed by them as resident manager of the Bonnie Villa Apartments in Fairborn, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conjunction with the complaint, Robert Peebles filed an affidavit of attachment and an attachment bond of $ 8,000 with the Clerk of Courts of Greene County.  In the affidavit, Peebles stated that he believed that Betty Ann Clement was about to remove her property out of the court's jurisdiction with intent to defraud the plaintiffs, that she was about to convert the property into money, and that she had concealed, assigned, removed, or disposed of property or was about to do so in order to defraud the plaintiffs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 12, 1977, orders of attachment were issued attaching various bank accounts, an automobile, household goods, and other personal effects of Betty and Kimberly Clement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 25, 1977, Betty Ann Clement filed an answer and counterclaim, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and on April 29, 1977, the Peebles filed an amended complaint increasing their demand to $ 15,164.45. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 9, 1978, Betty Ann Clement moved the court to dismiss the order of attachment arguing, in part, that Ohio's attachment procedure is unconstitutional.  The Court of Common Pleas granted the motion, finding that the Ohio Attachment Before Judgment Statutes are unconstitutional, and as a consequence the court ordered that the attachment be dissolved. </SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed but limited its holding to the facts of this case. Creditor sought further review and the court affirmed, holding that prejudgment attachment statutes must at a minimum: (1) require plaintiff to furnish an appropriate bond or other security to compensate a defendant in the event of wrongful seizure; (2) require that an affidavit be filed alleging personal knowledge of specific facts forming a basis for prejudgment seizure; (3) require that a judicial officer pass upon the sufficiency of the facts alleged in the affidavit; (4) provide for dissolution of the seizure upon the posting of a bond by defendant; and (5) provide an immediate right of hearing to the defendant in which plaintiff must prove that the seizure was warranted.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs-appellants, Mr. and Mrs. Charles T. Carroll, served as foster parents for five or six children from Richland County Childrens Services prior to 1976.  Aware of the Ohio Youth Commission's (OYC) need for foster homes, they sought and received approval to act as foster parents for adolescents placed with them by OYC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1976, appellants purchased a 13-room house in Washington Township for use as a foster home.  The house is situated in an area zoned for agricultural and single-family residential use.  In order to accommodate the foster children, as well as their own children, the Carrolls made certain structural modifications, including the installation of a fire-alarm system and septic tank, the remodeling of a kitchen and bathroom, and the conversion of the third floor into a dormitory facility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their first year as foster parents for OYC, the Carrolls had an average of seven foster children living with them at any one time.  The youths stayed at the Carroll home for periods ranging from six months to one year; consequently, a total of 17 foster children lived with the Carrolls during that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  year, all of them within the ages of 15 to 17. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts show that the Carrolls enter into a separate contract for each child placed in their home by the OYC, and that each child remains a ward of OYC.  The Carrolls are given an initial allowance of $ 100 per child, and are paid $ 11.50 per child per day by OYC.  In addition, OYC pays for all medical and dental care for the foster children, and reimburses appellants for the operation of their automobile.  The Carrolls testified that they supplement these allowances with money of their own in order to give their foster children what they consider to be a satisfactory living environment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1976, the zoning board determined that appellants' use of their property did not comply with township zoning resolutions.  Appellants sought, but were denied, both a use variance and a rezoning of their property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants then instituted this action in the Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment that they were in compliance with the township zoning resolutions or, in the alternative, that the zoning resolutions, as applied to them, were confiscatory and in violation of their right to due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">In an action commenced by plaintiffs, owners of a house used as a foster home, against defendant Zoning Commission of Washington Township, Ohio, seeking a declaratory judgment that they were in compliance with the Township zoning resolutions, or that the resolutions, as applied to them, were confiscatory, the Court of Appeals (Ohio) affirmed a trial court's judgment for the Commission. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The owners had purchased a 13-room house in the Township for use as a foster home. The house was situated in an area zoned for single-family residential use. The owners made certain structural modifications to the house in order to accommodate the foster children. The owners had an average of seven foster children living with them at any one time. The Township zoning board determined that the owners' use of their property did not comply with the zoning resolution. The owners were denied both a use variance and a rezoning of their property. The trial court enjoined the owners from using the house as a foster home. The court of appeals affirmed. The court, in turn, affirmed the court of appeals' judgment. The court found that the court of appeals did not err in finding that the foster home did not qualify as &quot;one family residential dwelling unit&quot; which the Township zoning resolution required. The court stated that a comprehensive township zoning plan which excluded a foster home from an area zoned for residential use was not per se unconstitutional, and that such a zoning plan was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellee herein, Siffrin Residential Association (Siffrin), is an Ohio non-profit corporation formed to promote the development of a residential, rather than an institutional, type of living environment for certain mentally retarded persons of Stark County, pursuant to the provisions of R. C. 5123.18, which provides for the licensing, inspection and operation of &quot;residential facilities.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Ohio for a number of years has by law provided for the licensing of facilities for the care of mentally retarded persons.  Such licensure provision was contained in R. C. 5123.18.  In 1977, the General Assembly enacted a new R. C. 5123.18 which became effective on October 31, 1977.  The new section was included within Am. Sub. S. B. No. 71. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">The portions of R. C. 5123.18 as enacted which are germane to this discussion are as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(A) As used in this section and section 5123.19 of the Revised Code: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) 'Residential facility' means a home or facility in which a person with a developmental disability resides, except a home subject to Chapter 3721 of the Revised Code or the home of a relative or legal guardian in which a person with a developmental disability resides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(2) 'Developmental disability' means a disability that originated before the attainment of eighteen years of age and can be expected to continue indefinitely, constitutes a substantial handicap to the person's ability to function normally in society, and is attributable to mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, or any other condition found to be closely related to mental retardation because such condition results in similar impairment of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior or requires similar treatment and services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(3) 'Family home' means a residential facility that provides room and board, personal care, habilitation services, and supervision in a family setting for not more than eight persons with developmental disabilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(4) 'Group home' means a residential facility that provides room and board, personal care, habilitation services, and supervision in a family setting for at least nine but not more than sixteen persons with developmental disabilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(B) Every person desiring to operate a residential facility shall apply for licensure of the facility to the chief of the division of mental retardation and developmental disabilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(D) Any person may operate a licensed family home as a permitted use in any residential district or zone, including any single-family residential district or zone, of any political subdivision.  Family homes may be required to comply with area, height, yard, and architectural compatibility requirements that are uniformly imposed upon all single-family residences within the district or zone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(E) Any person may operate a licensed group home as a permitted use in any multiple-family residential district or zone of any political subdivision, except that a political subdivision that has enacted a zoning ordinance or resolution establishing planned unit development districts may exclude group homes from such districts, and a political subdivision that has enacted a zoning ordinance or resolution may regulate group homes in multiple-family residential districts or zones as a conditionally permitted use or special exception, in either case, under reasonable and specific standards and conditions set out in the zoning ordinance or resolution to: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) Require the architectural design and site layout of the home and the location, nature, and height of any walls, screens, and fences to be compatible with adjoining land uses and the residential character of the neighborhood; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(2) Require compliance with yard, parking, and sign regulation; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(3) Limit excessive concentration of homes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(F) This section does not prohibit a political subdivision from applying to residential facilities nondiscriminatory regulations requiring compliance with health, fire, and safety regulations and building standards and regulations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(G) Divisions (D) and (E) of this section are not applicable to municipal corporations that had in effect on June 15, 1977, an ordinance specifically permitting in residential zones licensed residential facilities by means of permitted uses, conditional uses, or special exception, so long as such ordinance remains in effect without any substantive modification.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In November 1977, Siffrin purchased a residence at 1532 Yale Avenue, N.W., Canton, for the proposed use as a &quot;residential facility&quot; to house eight or fewer &quot;developmentally disabled&quot; female adults.  This site is in an area zoned R-2 within Chapter 1137 of the Canton City Ordinances, which zoning classification restricts the sites to one and two-family dwellings. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;The sections of Chapter 1137 of the Canton city zoning ordinance which are pertinent to this discussion are as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1137.02 Permitted Uses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Principal permitted uses are as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(a) Any use permitted in the R-1 District. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(b) Two-family dwellings.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Within the zoning ordinances of Canton we find the following definitions: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1123.24 Dwelling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;'Dwelling' means any building or portion thereof, which is designed for or used for residential purposes; including one and two-family and multi-family, but not including a tent, tourist cabin, trailer, trailer coach, hotels, motels, boarding houses or lodging houses.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1123.25 Dwelling unit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;'Dwelling unit' means a group of rooms arranged, maintained or designed to be occupied by a single-family (see definition of family), and consists of a complete bathroom, complete kitchen or kitchenette; and facilities for living, sleeping and eating.  All of the facilities are to be located in contiguous rooms and used exclusively by such family and by any authorized persons occupying such dwelling unit with the family.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1123.27 Dwelling, Two-family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;'Two-family dwelling' means a building designed for or used exclusively for residence purposes by two families living independently of each other.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;1123.30 Family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;'Family' means one or more persons occupying a dwelling unit and living as a single housekeeping unit, whether or not related to each other by birth or marriage, as distinguished from a group occupying a boarding house, lodging house, motel, hotel, fraternity or sorority house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellants, Alex J. and Mary L. Garcia, are owners of a residence located adjacent to the proposed facility, in which residence they have lived for approximately 25 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1978, Siffrin made application to the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, pursuant to R. C. 5123.18, for licensure of the home.  The department, pursuant to law, issued a notice to the Canton Planning Commission, Canton Board of Zoning Appeals and the Clerk of Canton City Council, prior to the publication of the required legal notice.  Letters of objection to the proposed location were filed by Mr. Garcia and another neighbor.  Subsequently, a petition was signed by some 50 residents in the neighborhood, objecting to the location of this facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canton Zoning Department also filed a letter of objection, stating that the proposed use was neither a permitted use nor a conditional use in a R-2 district, and that the home as proposed could only qualify as a &quot;boarding house&quot; or &quot;rooming house,&quot; a conditional use in a R-4 residential district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation reviewed the objections, including that of the city of Canton, and determined that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  zoning restrictions imposed by the odinance were superseded by the effect of R. C. 5123.81 and, more specifically, subsection (D) thereof, which, in pertinent part, states as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any person may operate a licensed family home as a permitted use in any residential district or zone, including any single-family residential district or zone, of any political subdivision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This present cause was thereafter instituted on April 21, 1978, by the filing of the complaint by the Garcias, in the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County (case No. 78-450), seeking to enjoin Siffrin from establishing a &quot;family home&quot; at 1532 Yale Avenue, and requesting that R. C. 5123.18(D) be declared unconstitutional.  Appellants also requested that Drs. Moritz and Cannon of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation be enjoined from licensing the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Canton filed a complaint against the same defendants, also seeking to enjoin the licensing and establishment of this &quot;family home,&quot; and to have R. C. 5123.18(D) declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Ohio Legal Rights Service, moved and was granted leave to intervene as a party-defendant in case No. 78-450.  The cases were consolidated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and after a hearing, a preliminary injunction was granted to the plaintiffs enjoining the director from issuing a license for this operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon trial of this matter, evidence was adduced showing that Siffrin is a corporate entity controlled by a board of directors; that the corporation has at least one other &quot;residential facility&quot; in operation; and that the overall operations of this proposed facility, as well as the currently operating facility, are under the control of a director.  The staff that was to be brought into this proposed operation, in addition to the director, would be a married couple who would reside on the premises, two other women working full-time, and other special purpose training staff as needed to carry out the &quot;habilitation services&quot; and &quot;personal care&quot; as provided by statute and regulations.  &quot;Habilitation,&quot; as defined in R. C. 5123.68(G), &quot;means the process by which the staff of the institution assists the resident to acquire and maintain those life skills which enable him to cope more effectively with the demands of his own person and of his environment and to raise the level of his physical, mental, social, and vocational efficiency.  Habilitation includes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but is not limited to programs of formal, structured education and training * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director and an admissions committee screen the applicants for the home, and individual month-to-month contracts are entered into with either the individual, member of the family or guardian, or the state of Ohio if the person was institutionalized.  The amount charged for the services to be given the individual varies with the physical or educational needs or requirements of the individual.  The clients are persons with one or more &quot;developmental disabilities&quot;; all are characterized by deficiencies in adaptive behavior, in socialization, and in life skills, and some have both neurological and organic disabilities or damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget for this facitlity would be approximately $ 61,000 &quot;broken down * * * [into] direct care, indirect staff cost for secretarial, administrative, administrative non-personnel cost, telephone, travel, things of this nature, food, mortgage, utilities, depreciation, insurance, things like this.&quot; There is a rather complex funding of residents, including federal and state funds for room and board reimbursement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, on August 18, 1978, Judge DeHoff, of the Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Common Pleas of Stark County, issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Among the findings of fact of the trial court are the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;20.  Under the definitions contained in Chapter 1123 of the Canton City Ordinance, &quot;family&quot; means one or more persons occupying a dwelling unit and living as a single housekeeping unit, whether or not related to each other by birth or marriage, and who do not pay consideration for living there and who do not have an &quot;operator&quot; running the dwelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;21.  Ohio Revised Code Section 5123.18 defines &quot;family home&quot; as a residential facility that provides room and board, personal care, habilitation services, and supervision in a family setting for not more than eight persons with developmental disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;22.  Ohio Revised Code Section 5123.18(B) provides that persons desiring to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">operate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a family home residential facility must apply for a license. [Emphasis </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;23.  The proposed Siffrin Residential Association for the Developmentally Disabled of Stark county &quot;family home&quot; will house up to eight female adults, two full-time houseparents and a part-time relief staff employed by the Siffrin Association for the Develpmentally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Disabled of Stark County and will be administered by a full-time director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;24.  The proposed Siffrin Residential Association for the Develpmentally Disabled of Stark County &quot;family home&quot; will operate when at full capacity, on a budget of $ 65,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;26.  Location of the proposed &quot;family home&quot; at 1532 Yale Avenue N. W., Canton, Stark County, Ohio, immediately adjacent to the residence of Alex J. Garcia and Mary Garcia, will cause a diminution of the Garcias' property value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;27.  Location of a group home housing eight mentally retarded adult men at 150 South Rose Avenue, Akron, Ohio, resulted in a thirty-five (35) percent tax valuation reduction to the immediate neighboring property owned by Charles Zindle and Charlotte Zindle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conclusions of law of the trial court included the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.  The defendant's, Siffrin Residential Association for the Developmentally Disabled of Stark County, proposed use of the premises located at 1532 Yale Avenue N. W., Canton, Stark county, Ohio, as a &quot;family home&quot; is not a &quot;family&quot; within the meaning of Canton's Zoning Ordinances, effective February 14, 1977, and is not a permitted or conditional use in an R-2 zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 71, subsections (D) and (E), Ohio Revised Code Section 5123.18(D), (E), are not &quot;general&quot; laws of the State of Ohio within the meaning of Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4.  Canton's Zoning Ordinances are enacted pursuant to the constitutional grant of powers of local self-government, Article XVIII, Section 3; are not subject to the &quot;conflict&quot; provision of Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution; and are not superseded by Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 71, subsections (D) and (E), Ohio Revised Code Section 5123.18(D), (E).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5.  Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 71, subsections (D), (E) and (G), Ohio Revised Code Section 5123.18(D), (E), (G) are not uniform in their operation throughout the State of Ohio and are void as special laws prohibited by Article II, Section 26 of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6.  Amended Substitute Senate Bill No. 71, subsections (D) and (E), Ohio Revised Code Section 5123.18(D), (E), are unconstitutional and in violation of the due process clauses of Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that they are arbitrary and capricious.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Judgment was accordingly entered for the Garcias and the city of Canton.  Siffrin, Drs. Moritz and Cannon, and the Ohio Legal Rights Service thereafter appealed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas to the Court of Appeals.  The members of that court rendered their opinion and judgment on March 1979, reversing the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals found that the Siffrin operation would be in compliance with the Canton ordinance, in that the facility and its residents could be considered a &quot;family&quot; under the ordinance because they would be &quot;occupying a dwelling unit and living as a single housekeeping unit.&quot; Further, the court found that the trial court erred in finding that the establishment of the Siffrin home will occasion a diminution in the value of the Garcias' adjacent property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals further found that R. C. 5123.18(D) and (E) are general laws of the state of Ohio within the meaning of Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the Court of Appeals held that the Canton zoning ordinance, being an exercise of the police power pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, is subject to the conflict provision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of that section, and held that R. C. 5123.18 was not a &quot;special&quot; law, even though under subdivision (G) it excludes certain cities from the zoning overriding features of (D) and (E), and that such statute did have a uniform operation throughout the state, and was therefore not contrary to Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  &quot;The Siffrin Residential Association's proposed use of the residence at 1532 Yale Ave. N.W., Canton, Ohio, as a &quot;family home,&quot; defined in O.R.C. Section 5123.18(A)(3), is not a &quot;family&quot; use as defined in the Canton city ordinance and consequently is not a permitted use in an R-2 zoned district.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  &quot; Ohio Revised Code Sections 5123.18(D) and (E) are not &quot;general laws&quot; of the state of Ohio withing the meaning of Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  &quot;Canton's zoning ordinances are enacted pursuant to the constitutional grant of powers of local self-government, Article XVIII, Section 3; are not subject to the &quot;conflict&quot; provision of Article XVIII, Section 3; and are not superseded by Ohio Revised Code Sections 5123.18(D) and (E).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  &quot; Ohio Revised Code Sections 5123.18(D), (E) and (G) are void as special laws prohibited by Article&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  II, Section 26 of the Ohio Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  &quot; Ohio Revised Code Sections 5123.18(D) and (E) are unconstitutional and in violation of the due process clauses of Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  &quot; Ohio Revised Code Sections 5123.18(D) and (E) create an arbitrary and discriminatory classification of persons and are unconstitutional under Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  &quot;Appellants Garcias are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent operation of the Siffrin Residential Association's &quot;family home&quot; at 1532 Yale Avenue, N.W., Canton, Ohio pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 713.3.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  &quot;Application of the city of Canton's zoning ordinance to prohibit the proposed use of the Siffrin Residential Association's &quot;family home&quot; in an R-2 district is a constitutional exercise of the city's police powers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Plaintiffs, neighbors and a city, appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Stark County (Ohio) that reversed a trial court's decision and ruled that defendant property owner's proposed use of a residence as a facility and home for several developmentally disabled adults was not contrary to Canton, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance ch. 1137.02 (ordinance) and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.18, which permitted such a use, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The property owner (owner) purchased a home in an area that was restricted to one- and two-family dwellings under the ordinance and sought to operate a group home for several developmentally disabled adults. The neighbors and the city opposed the use, arguing that it did not conform to the ordinance and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.18, which permitted the operation of such a facility in any zone, was unconstitutional. The trial court rendered judgment for the city and neighbors. The appellate court reversed, finding that the facility fell within the ordinance and that &sect; 5123.18 was constitutional. On appeal, the court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional and that, because the persons housed in the home would require individual and particularized care, it was clear that the home was not intended to create a family atmosphere within the meaning of &quot;family use&quot; as used in the ordinance. The court then declared &sect; 5123.18&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court ruled that the statute impermissibly restricted the city's police power and impermissibly classified cities in its attempt to create a deadline by which no ordinance could be enacted to restrict the creation of such homes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cities Service Oil Company, appellee herein, applied to Joseph Orteca, Building Commissioner of the city of Warrensville Heights (&quot;city&quot;), for a building permit.  Appellee seeks to tear down the existing automotive service station on its property in that city, located at the southwest corner of Northfield Road and Clarkwood Parkway, and to replace it with a self-service gasoline station and Quik-Mart facility.  The city planning commission unanimously voted to refuse the permit, a decision which was affirmed by city council on September 21, 1976. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1976, the General Assembly enacted R. C. 3741.141&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> permitting the operation of self-service automotive stations within the state.  The statute became effective on January 1, 1977.  On November 3, 1976, the Warrensville Heights city council passed ordinance No. 1976-150 forbidding self-service gasoline stations in the city.  In February of 1977, appellee filed a second application for a building permit, accompanied by a set of plans approved by the state, as required by the building commissioner's regulations.  Orteca neither approved nor refused this second application, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but informed appellee by telephone that no permit would be issued since the city planning commission and council had rejected the first application. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;R. C. 3741.141 provides: &quot;Franchised dealers shall be allowed the option as to whether they wish to offer full-service, self-service on one island, or complete self-service in the conduct of their business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee's parcel of land is in an area zoned Class U-3, apartment house use.  The city had issued a special use permit to Flo-An, Inc., in 1963, for the parcel in question.  There was a transfer of ownership of the parcel to appellee soon thereafter and, on April 14, 1964, the city issued a building permit to appellee to allow the construction of the present service station facilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, 1977, appellee brought an action in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County seeking to require Orteca to issue a building permit to appellee.  On July 20, 1978, the Court of Appeals issued an order granting a limited writ of mandamus directing Orteca and the city to process appellee's building permit according to a procedure outlined by the court. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pursuant to that order, hearings were held before the city&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  planning commission and council regarding appellee's application.  Subsequently, appellee was informed that a new special use permit would be required and was also notified of non-compliance of appellee's plans with city ordinances.  Council's granting of the special use permit was conditioned on appellee's compliance with certain enumerated areas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellee objected to several of the conditions.  By letter of October 19, 1978, Orteca informed appellee that the building permit application had been denied. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

The company's application was denied. The appellate court then issued a writ of mandamus ordering the commissioner to issue the permit. The appellate court also found Warrensville Heights, Ohio, Ordinance No. 1976-150 unconstitutional and void ab initio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The company sought a building permit to tear down an existing automotive service station on its property and to erect a self-service station and grocery store. The company's parcel of land was zoned for apartment house use. The previous owner had received a special use permit from the city. The city refused the company's first two permit requests. In response to the appellate court's limited writ, a hearing was held and the company was informed that a new special use permit would be required and that its plans were not in compliance with Ordinance No. 1976-150. On review, the court held that (1) the writ of mandamus was not available to control the discretion of public officials, and that the appellate court erred in ordering the city and commissioner to perform the discretionary act of issuing a building permit for a use not permitted by the applicable zoning ordinance, (2) the appellate court erred in estopping the city and commissioner from asserting the personal nature of a special use permit, and (3) where Ordinance No. 1976-150 was in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3741.141, the ordinance was void and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment insofar as the company had not established a clear legal right to a building permit. The court held that the city could validly require the company to procure a new special use permit as a condition precedent to issuance of a building permit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 8, 1976, the Public Utilities Commission issued an opinion and order in case No. 74-761-TP-AIR which approved, among other things, the substitution by the Ohio Bell Telephone Company (Ohio Bell) of measured rate local business service for flat rate service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 17, 1978, a complaint was filed requesting reclassification of elementary and secondary schools as residential.  On May 15, 1978, Ohio Bell and the complainants entered into a stipulation, agreement, and recommendation wherein the schools agreed to dismiss their complaint and Ohio Bell agreed to modify the measured rate service as it applied to them by placing a ceiling on the amount they could be charged under the measured rate system in recognition of their unique needs.  On May 25, 1978, the commission found the stipulation, agreement, and recommendation to be reasonable and approved a tariff giving the schools this special treatment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, numerous complaints were filed regarding the adequacy and sufficiency of the classification system used by Ohio Bell to determine which customers received measured rate service, including one filed June 8, 1978, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the County Commissioners' Association of Ohio, appellants herein, on behalf of the association and the state's county governments (case No. 78-940-TP-CSS).  Due to the large number of complaints filed, the commission, on its own motion, on December 14, 1978, initiated an investigation into the classification system (case No. 78-1487-TP-COI). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous parties intervened, including the appellants.  After taking testimony, in February 1979, the commission ordered, on July 18, 1979, that the investigation be dismissed and no new classifications be created.  Because the special treatment of schools was the product of an approved stipulation, the commission further ordered that the situation be reviewed in a separately docketed proceeding.  A number of parties, including appellants, did not argue that the schools should not be given special treatment, but rather that the counties should receive the same treatment as the schools.  The commission refused to make such an order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing had been held on appellants' complaint on August 1, 1978, prior to the initiation of the commission's investigative case.  The notice regarding the investigative case stated as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ORDERED, That&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon written request of the parties of record in any other case seeking reclassification under Ohio Bell's existing tariff, notice be taken of the portions of the transcript in said cases shown to be relevant to the subject matter of the instant investigation, and the same be adopted into this proceeding.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing in the investigative case the County Commissioners' Association requested that the record from this complaint case be adopted into the investigative case.  It was noted that Ohio Bell requested that the record from the investigative case be adopted into the record of all pending complaint proceedings.  The hearing examiner granted the association's request.  In the complaint case, the commission administratively noticed the record of the investigative case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 28, 1979, the commission entered its findings and order in the complaint case, which incorporated the conclusion of the investigative case and ordered that the matter be dismissed without altering the classification as urged by the appellants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants appealed both decisions to this court, arguing that the differentiation between schools and county governments is contrary to statute and in violation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the guarantees of equal protection and due process of law contained in the Ohio and United States Constitutions.  In addition, appellants argue that the disposition of their complaint (case No. 78-940-TP-CSS) is invalid because (1) the length of time taken to decide the case was unreasonably long, (2) the order did not contain sufficient findings of fact, and (3) it was the result of administratively noticing the record of the investigative case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant association of county commissioners sought review of a decision by appellee Public Utilities Commission (Ohio), which refused the association's request that the Commission grant counties the same special telephone rate ceiling that it previously had approved for elementary and secondary schools. The association contended that the rate differentiation was contrary to statute and that it violated equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">After the Commission approved a tariff giving elementary and secondary schools a special rate ceiling for telephone rates, the association requested the same treatment for county governments. The Commission denied the request and found that the facts before the Commission formed a reasonable basis for distinguishing between counties and schools. In its ruling, the court found that the schools were given special treatment because of their unique status, their unique needs, their inability to pass on costs, and their financial plight. Although there were similarities between the counties and the schools, the differences justified the differential in treatment on both statutory and constitutional grounds. Both the counties and the schools had financial problems, but the counties could handle those problems better without experiencing a drop in essential services, so the schools' need for special treatment was unique. Because of that uniqueness, the court held that the Commission's refusal to order the same rate treatment for the counties was not unlawful, unreasonable, or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 14, 1976, complaints were issued against defendants-appellants, Larry C. Flynt, Jimmy R. Flynt and Althea Leasure Flynt, for allegedly pandering obscenity in violation of R. C. 2907.32(A)(2), complicity in violation of R. C. 2923.03(A)(2) and personal accountability for organizational conduct in violation of R. C. 2901.24(A)(1).  The complaints alleged that the defendants, as officers, agents or employees of Hustler magazine, caused, or permitted, the exhibition or dissemination of materials known to be obscene, to wit, the July and August, 1976, issues of Hustler magazine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaints on the basis that they were discriminately prosecuted, in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court granted an evidentiary hearing on the motion, whereupon the following facts were elicited, primarily from Bruce A. Taylor, the assistant law director for the city of Cleveland.  Taylor had been in charge of the city's obscenity prosecution when these complaints were issued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was testified that since April of 1973 the city of Cleveland had initiated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between 500 and 550 obscenity prosecutions.  The materials selected for prosecution were largely determined in accordance with instructions given by Taylor to police officers, although the officers were given considerable latitude to exercise their own discretion.  The instructions provided that applicable Supreme Court decisions proscribed the sale of &quot;obscenity which is hard-core.&quot; &quot;Hard-core&quot; was understood to encompass &quot;actually instead of simulated acts of sex.&quot; The officers were further instructed to seize the &quot;most explicit of the material available.&quot; Enforcement therefore concentrated on &quot;adult book-stores and theaters.&quot; There was also testimony that certain materials which may not have contained &quot;actual sexual contact&quot; were, nevertheless, seized and prosecuted.  It was conceded by Taylor, that &quot;[w]e had never prosecuted a magazine like Hustler.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further testimony revealed that the police department received complaints about the July 1976 issue of Hustler, and, in particular, a cartoon depicting sexual activity between prominent political figures and the Statue of Liberty.  An investigation ensued, whereupon a copy of the issue was brought to Taylor, who subsequently decided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to initiate action against the magazine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor asserted that Hustler was prosecuted as a test case.  Other magazines of a similar nature had been under investigation for eight months without being prosecuted.  He conceded that such an extended investigation was unusual.  When questioned why he did not prosecute these magazines, Taylor stated that he was &quot;waiting for this case.&quot; When he was asked whether further prosecutions would follow, should he receive a favorable decision in this case, Taylor responded, &quot;I don't know.  That decision I can't make alone either&quot; but &quot;[i]t's being discussed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the basis of this testimony and the testimony of a Cleveland police officer working obscenity cases, the trial judge determined that the defendants were prosecuted discriminatorily, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and dismissed the complaints.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the defendants failed to sustain their burden of proof. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of appellants' motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellants, a city and senior citizens, sought judicial review of an order of appellee Public Utility Commission (Ohio), which granted a rate increase to intervenor electric company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The city and the senior citizens opposed the electric company's application to raise utility rates. The Commission granted the electric company's increase, including a nuclear plant, attorney's fees, declining block rates, a construction work in progress (CWIP), charitable contributions, and advertising costs. The city and the senior citizens sought judicial review. The court affirmed the Commission's decision except in so far as institutional and promotional advertising and charitable contributions were included in the electric company's rate increase. The finding that the nuclear plant was used and useful was not against the weight of the evidence or unsupported by the record. Likewise, the Commission exercised sound judgment in including attorney's fees in the rate increase. As to the CWIP, the Commission properly granted an allowance in accord with constitutional guidelines respecting its authority. Nevertheless, the court reversed the Commission's decision to the extent that it included promotional and institutional advertising costs, which primarily benefitted the electric company, and charitable contributions, which were an unnecessary expense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Geauga County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard L. Rarick was appointed Building Service Superintendent of Geauga County in 1963.  His wife, Erma M. Rarick, was appointed Assistant Building Service Superintendent in 1965. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter dated January 5, 1977, the Board of Geauga County Commissioners notified the Department of Administrative Services that they were designating a number of positions, including the ones occupied by the Raricks, as unclassified pursuant to R. C. 124.11(A)(9).  The department approved of the designations.  It is unclear whether these positions had been considered at one time to be in the classified service.  It does not appear that the Raricks were ever appointed on the basis of the results of competitive examinations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1977, the Raricks were terminated from their employment.  No reason for the terminations was given; the procedures required in R. C. Chapter 124 to terminate employees in the classified service were not used. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Raricks appealed their terminations to the State Personnel Board of Review, and hearing was held on August 19, 1977.  At the hearing it was established (1) that the superintendent made recommendations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regarding the hiring and firing of employees, which the county commissioners always followed; (2) that he purchased supplies on blanket purchase orders; (3) that he had contracted snow removal duties to himself and others subject to approval by the commissioners; (4) that the Raricks owned their own cleaning equipment which they acquired from a monthly allowance given them by the commissioners; (5) that, in addition to doing maintenance work themselves, the Raricks supervised others in such work; and (6) that the assistant filled the superintendent's position during his absence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing examiner determined that these duties placed the Raricks in both a fiduciary and administrative relationship with the county commissioners and, as a consequence, he recommended that their appeals be dismissed because the board does not have jurisdiction over appeals of removals from positions in the unclassified service.  The board disaffirmed the report and ordered that the Raricks be reinstated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioners appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Geauga County which held that the Raricks' assigned and actual duties placed them in an administrative and fiduciary relationship with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commissioners.  Consequently, the court held that the order of the board was not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and that the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On separate appeal by the Raricks, the Court of Appeals reversed in each case, finding that, although the positions held by the Raricks are positions of trust, they did not involve the special confidence and trust necessary to place their positions in a fiduciary or administrative relationship with the appointing authority. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs-appellants, police officers and firefighters employed by the city of Cincinnati, instituted actions in the Court of Common Pleas challenging Cincinnati Ordinance No. 258-1977, which was enacted June 29, 1977.  Appellants' motion to consolidate the actions was granted by the trial court.  Appellants contended, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the ordinance, which seeks to regulate the residency of city employees, contravened certain provisions of the Ohio Constitution, and that its enactment exceeded the power conferred upon city council by the Cincinnati Charter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court subsequently granted appellants' motion for summary judgment, holding that the ordinance had a retroactive effect upon those city employees who were employed prior to the date of its passage.  The court, however, rejected appellants' claim that enactment of the ordinance was an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> act of the city council, holding that the Cincinnati Charter did not forbid the enactment of a valid residency ordinance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal and cross-appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed that portion of the trial court's judgment which upheld the council's power to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enact a valid residency ordinance, but reversed that portion which declared the subject ordinance to be unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Plaintiffs, police officers and firefighters employed by the city of Cincinnati, filed actions challenging Cincinnati, Ohio, Ordinance No. 258-1977. The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County affirmed that portion of the trial court's judgment which upheld the power of defendants, the city of Cincinnati and others, to enact a valid residency ordinance, but reversed that portion which declared the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The ordinance purported to amend Cincinnati, Ohio, Admin. Code art. XVII, &sect; 1, which imposed a residency requirement on city employees. Plaintiffs contended that the ordinance had a retroactive effect upon their constitutional right to travel. The court disagreed because there was no constitutional right to be employed by a municipality while living elsewhere. Prior to enactment of the ordinance, city employees were permitted to reside where they wished within the county, but the court found that this &quot;right&quot; was not vested such that its subsequent impairment violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court further found that the ordinance was drafted to avoid the problem of retroactivity where it did not require current employees divest themselves of property or to change their residence, but simply provided that if an employee desired to change his residence, he had to move into, or remain within, the city. Thus, the court concluded that the ordinance regulated future conduct and was prospective in operation. The court found that the Cincinnati charter allowed the council to pass laws relating to municipal service so long as they did not conflict with provisions of state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The state of Ohio challenged the decisions of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton and Cuyahoga Counties (Ohio) which had determined that Ohio Rev.

The court consolidated the actions for consideration upon appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Several individuals were indicted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2923.04, an organized crime statute that made it illegal to facilitate any services to a crime syndicate, defined therein as five or more persons engaged in certain broadly described activities. The indictments in two separate actions were either dismissed at trial or upon appeal, when both courts found &sect; 2923.04&nbsp;unconstitutional for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the statute lacked ascertainable standards of guilt. On further appeal, the court found that &sect; 2923.04 did not expressly limit the scienter requirement to illegal activities and could be used to wrongfully punish lawful conduct. The court found that &sect; 2923.04 did not specify with clarity the prohibited conduct so that a reasonable person would be given fair notice of its violation, and that the definitions of the statute's terms were imprecise. The court noted that the legislature's language gave much discretion to prosecutors who could use &sect; 2923.04 to turn minor offenses into first degree felonies. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the judgments of the courts of appeals, which had found for the individuals indicted under the organized crime statute and held that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness because it did not give adequate notice of the prohibited conduct to reasonable individuals. The court rejected appellant state's suggestion that the word &quot;illegal&quot; could be read into the statute's scienter requirement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalman Gerzeny, appellee herein, owns approximately 28 acres of land in Richfield Township which has at all relevant times been located in an &quot;R-1, Rural Residential&quot; zoning district. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is undisputed that appellee has significantly improved the appearance of his property since first acquiring it in 1967.  From a near swamp appellee has developed his property into a private park or playground, suitable for picnicking and other recreational activities.  Appellee has constructed a manmade lake suitable for swimming and fishing, a shelter pavilion, and a large &quot;barn.&quot; Appellee has used his property in the past for family reunions and other family activities.  Since 1973, appellee has authorized several organizational groups to use his property for meetings or picnics on a cost-free basis.  Appellee has at no time resided on the property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1977, appellee filed with the township zoning inspector an &quot;Application for Zoning Certificate&quot; to use his property as a &quot;privately owned park with related facilities.&quot; Such a certificate has always been required by the zoning resolution in connection with use of R-1 property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a private park.  The inspector refused to grant the certificate on the grounds that the proposed use required a conditional use permit which could only be issued by the Richfield Township Board of Zoning Appeals (hereinafter &quot;board&quot;). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee appealed to the board.  Following a public hearing, the board refused appellee a conditional zoning certificate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter Gerzeny appealed the board's denial to the Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R. C. Chapter 2506.  The court affirmed the denial of the conditional use permit.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the cause for further proceedings. </SPAN></P>

It was located in a residentially zoned area. He sought a conditional use permit, but the zoning board denied his request because Richfield Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 402-(2)(B) required a 100-acre minimum. The trial court affirmed that decision but the intermediate court reversed, on the ground that the inclusion of a minimum acreage requirement for the issuance of a conditional use permit for private parks deprived the property owner of equal protection because no minimum acreage was requisite to issuance of a permit for governmentally owned parks. On appeal, the court reversed because use of public parks or recreational grounds in a residential area for the common benefit of all the people of a zoning district was not commensurate with the use of lands by a private corporation for its exclusive profit in a manner forbidden by the zoning regulations. The court noted that if a zoning board was authorized to issue special permits for a named use it could not issue a permit if a specific requirement of the zoning ordinance would be violated thereby.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant herein, Union Oil Company of California, owns an approximate one acre parcel of real property situated in the city of Worthington.  The Union Oil property is zoned to permit single-family residential use.  In December 1976, Union Oil filed an action, pursuant to R. C. Chapter 2721, in which it sought a judgment declaring the existing zoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied to its property, declaring that Union Oil had a clear legal right to use its property for commercial purposes, enjoining the city of Worthington from interfering on the basis of zoning with the construction of a gasoline service station or car wash on the property, and ordering &quot;such further relief as the court deems just and proper.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 28, 1978, following trial to the court without a jury, the court entered judgment finding the existing zoning of the Union Oil property to be unconstitutional, and ordering that the &quot;property in question should be, and it hereby is, rezoned to C-3 * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals sustained the court's determination that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to Union Oil's property, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  neither party having assigned that finding as error.

The Court had to decide what nature of relief, a trial court could properly order in connection with a determination of unconstitutionality of a zoning ordinance in a declaratory judgment action. The trial court should have given notice to the zoning authority that, within a reasonable time, it could re-zone the property. Further notice should have been given that, if the property was not rezoned with in the time period, the trial court would authorize the property owner to proceed with the proposed use if, on the basis of the evidence before it, the trial court found the proposed use to be reasonable.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Dorian was employed as a school psychologist by the Euclid Board of Education on June 21, 1965.  She continued to be employed in that capacity through the 1973-74 school year and she had received a continuing contract pursuant to R. C. 3319.11 on April 12, 1971. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian was certified as both a high school French teacher and a school psychologist pursuant to R. C. 3319.22.  Her certification as a French teacher expired in August 1968. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1974, Dr. Spartoco DiBiasio, the Superintendent of the Euclid School District, recommended to the Euclid Board of Education that it reduce the number of school psychologists from three to two because of declining enrollment and a lack of funds.  The lack of funds was due, at least in part, to the decline in enrollment, state funding being predicated on school population.  DiBiasio further recommended the transfer of Dorian, the school psychologist with the least seniority, to the position of French teacher. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the superintendent's recommendation, the board reduced funding for school psychologist positions to account for two rather than three psychologists and reclassified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dorian as a French teacher.  Dorian was informed of the change orally and in a written letter dated April 2, 1974, which was in response to a letter she had written asserting a grievance.  The April 2nd letter, written by Robert Wightman, assistant superintendent of the district, notified Dorian that the board believed that she was able to teach French and that she should proceed to renew her certificate to teach that subject.  The letter indicated that personnel adjustments had been made necessary by decreased enrollment and class size policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Dorian's grievance, the board reaffirmed the reduction in school psychologists on July 15, 1974.  By letter dated August 21, 1974, Dorian refused to accept the French teaching assignment and withdrew her grievance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorian brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County alleging a breach of contract and asking for reinstatement with full pay at the salary level of a school psychologist.  The court concluded that because the board had not followed the procedures required under R. C. 3319.16, for terminating a teacher on a continuing contract, the board had breached its contract with Dorian.  The court ordered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that she be reinstated with full back pay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the trial court could have reasonably concluded from the evidence that the act of not paying Dorian was a termination rather than a suspension.  The court determined that failure to follow the procedure enumerated in R. C. 3319.16 constituted a breach of contract if the action of the board was a termination of a continuing contract. </SPAN></P>

The court stated that the suspension was reasonable due to the decreased enrollment and was procedurally valid under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.17. The court stated that the suspension procedure under &sect; 3319.17, which permitted the board to make reasonable reductions and provided for preference to teachers on continuing contract, was not unconstitutional.

One appellate court agreed, while the second determined that the deputies were not covered by the statute. The court found that the statute was ambiguous and applied principles of statutory construction. It ruled that members of police and fire agencies who worked for employers as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4111.01(D) were not entitled to overtime compensation. Such a construction avoided any conflict with other existing laws on compensation and work hours. Also, nothing in the court's construction violated either the due process or the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The deputies had not asserted any property interest protected by due process. Also, there was no violation of equal protection because there was a rational basis for treating police and fire protection personnel differently under the overtime statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two causes presented in this appeal were consolidated by the Court of Appeals to resolve identical issues of law.  Each cause was initially brought in the Court of Claims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Moss</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, plaintiff-appellants, Lenore and Abraham Moss, allege that Mrs. Moss fractured her ankle stepping into a hole at West Branch State Park, Ravenna, Ohio.  Plaintiffs further allege that the hole was caused by the combined negligence of the state and other private parties.  Plaintiffs also assert that they made certain purchases at the park, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gasoline (for plaintiffs' boat) and refreshments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">O'Neal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, plaintiff-appellant, Bobbie O'Neal, as administratrix of the estate of Diedre O'Neal, sues in wrongful death for the drowning of the decedent at Punderson State Park, Geauga County.  Plaintiff alleges that the decedent's death was caused by the negligence of the defendants, various departments of the state and Edward Skipper, manager of the area.  As in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Moss</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, plaintiff O'Neal asserts an expenditure by the aggrieved party at the state facility, to wit, the rental of a canoe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Claims dismissed the claims against the state for failure to state a claim for relief because the state was immune from liability pursuant to R. C. 1533.181.  Since only non-state parties remained, the court reasoned that it lacked jurisdiction as to them, and accordingly dismissed both cases in their entirety.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The two causes presented in the appeal were consolidated by the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) to resolve identical issues of law. Appellants, an administratrix and a couple, sought review of two decisions that affirmed two decisions of the trial court that dismissed the a administratrix and couple's wrongful death and negligence claims, respectively, against appellee Ohio Department of Natural Resources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">In one case, the administratrix filed a wrongful death action for the drowning of the decedent at a state park. In the other case, the couple filed a negligence action when the wife broke her leg at another state park. Both parties indicated that they made purchases at the state park. The trial court dismissed the claims. The appellate court affirmed. The administratrix and the couple appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the state-owned lands were premises within Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1533.18 and 1533.181, which granted the owner, the lessor, or the occupier of the premises immunity from suit by a recreational user. The court found that the parties who did not pay a fee, but made other purchases, such as the decedent and the wife, were recreational users. The court held that the decedent and the wife's purchases did not qualify as a fee. The court opined that the recreational immunity did not deny equal protection. The court noted that there was a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest in encouraging the owners of premises suitable for recreational pursuits to open their land to public use without worrying about liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the decision that the Department was not liable for the wrongful death of the decedent or for the injury to the wife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 23, 1978, Jacqueline Blevins was arrested and charged with soliciting in violation of city of Cleveland Ordinance No. 619.09.  Section 619.09(b)(1) requires that, upon conviction of a first offense, &quot;[a]t least 10 days' imprisonment and a fine of $ 200.00 are mandatory * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blevins' case was assigned to Judge Salvatore R. Calandra (hereinafter appellee) of the Cleveland Municipal Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blevins entered a plea of not guilty and filed a motion to dismiss.  The city of Cleveland (hereinafter appellant) filed a memorandum in opposition to Blevins' motion and demanded that the mandatory ten-days' imprisonment be imposed upon conviction.  Thereafter, appellee held the mandatory sentence provision, subsection (b)(1), to be unconstitutional as constituting cruel and unusual punishment.  Thereupon, Blevins withdrew her plea of not guilty and entered a plea of no contest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 22, 1979, Blevins was found guilty of violating Section 619.09 as a first offender, and, upon consideration of the probation report, was sentenced to one-year's probation, 60 days and costs, the days and costs suspended.  Appellee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereby failed to impose the mandatory ten-days' imprisonment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals, seeking a writ ordering appellee to impose the mandatory ten-days' imprisonment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 2, 1979, the Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint, declaring that appellant had an adequate remedy at law and that failure to sentence according to law that was declared unconstitutional was a discretionary matter and not a legal duty and, therefore, not within the scope of mandamus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court on appeal as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The City appealed an order of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which dismissed its complaint for a writ of mandamus ordering respondent trial judge to impose a mandatory 10-day sentence upon defendant after her conviction for solicitation in violation of Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 619.09. The City argued that it did not have an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant was charged with solicitation in violation of &sect; 619.09. She pled not guilty and moved to dismiss; the City opposed the motion and demanded that the mandatory 10-day imprisonment be imposed upon conviction under &sect; 619.09(b)(1). The trial court held that &sect; 619.09(b)(1) was unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant withdrew her plea of not guilty and pled no contest. She was convicted as a first offender and sentenced to probation. The City sought a writ of mandamus compelling the trial judge to impose sentence. The appellate court dismissed on the ground that the City had an adequate remedy at law. On appeal, the court looked to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67(A), which provided that a prosecutor could appeal, with leave, any decision of a trial court in a criminal case except the final verdict. The court thus held that the City had an adequate remedy at law through discretionary appeal and failed to pursue it; until leave to appeal was sought and denied, mandamus was not an available remedy. Also, the trial judge's failure to impose sentence was not a breach of a legal duty because he did not ignore the mandatory provision but found it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the order denying the City's request for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greater Cincinnati Junior Chamber of Commerce (the &quot;Jaycees&quot;) is an organization with the stated purpose of promoting civic welfare and of educating its members in civic duty and responsibility and in leadership.  In order to finance these activities, the Jaycees solicit contributions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to financial difficulties, the Jaycees entered into a contract with R. E. Holloway, who, as Holloway Productions (hereinafter &quot;Holloway&quot;), was to provide and promote a children's variety show to be held in the Cincinnati area on December 16, 1974, guaranteeing the Jaycees a minimum profit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 24, 1974, the Cincinnati Charitable Solicitations Commission denied Holloway's application for licenses as a professional promoter and solicitor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The denial was based on the failure of Holloway to be registered and bonded pursuant to R. C. Chapter 1716, and on the fact that the cost of solicitation in Holloway's contract with the Jaycees exceeded limits placed on such costs in the city's charitable solicitations ordinance, Chapter 821 of the Cincinnati Municipal Code (hereinafter &quot;ordinance&quot;).  The commission also cited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  previous violations of the ordinance by Holloway.  The commission further found that Holloway had failed to use the proper trustee bank account in handling the proceeds of a circus it had promoted earlier that year in Cincinnati. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holloway did not pursue its right of appeal to the city manager provided for in the ordinance, but elected to join with the Jaycees and file an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County against the Attorney General, the city of Cincinnati, and the members of the commission, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and void. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney General filed a counterclaim, not relevant to the instant action, which has been separated from this case and is still pending in the Court of Common Pleas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing testimony and receiving briefs, the trial court, in a letter to counsel dated September 7, 1977, found the ordinance to be unconstitutional due to the vagueness of the definition of charitable organization, and the discriminatory effect of the ordinance against professional promoters.  The court further declared that the ordinance set forth no guidelines for its administration.  On October&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4, 1977, the court journalized its entry and made permanent the injunction sought by the plaintiffs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal by defendants, the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ordinance, with the exception of its use of character and reputation as criteria for granting registration and licenses, is a constitutionally valid use of the city's police power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The civic organization hired the production company to provide and promote a children's variety show. The Cincinnati Charitable Solicitations Commission (commission) denied the production company's application for licensure as a professional promoter. The denial was based primarily on the fact that the cost of the solicitation in the production company's contract with the civic organization exceeded the city's charitable solicitations ordinance. Appellants brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellants but the appellate court reversed the decision and held that the ordinance was a proper exercise of the city's police power. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance did not violate any provisions of the Unites States or Ohio Constitutions by legislatively distinguishing between charitable solicitations performed by a non-affiliated solicitor in the community or those performed by parties affiliated with the charity. The court further held that use of the word &quot;charitable&quot; in the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this original action, relator, David W. Swetland, d.b.a. Park Investment Co., seeks a writ of mandamus directing respondents, Commissioner of Tax Equalization and Auditor of Cuyahoga County, &quot;to rescind and withdraw any and all guidelines, forms and applications prepared and circulated by them which in any way whatsoever give or tend to give legal effect to R. C. 323.152(B) and to instruct all of their subordinates responsible for real property tax assessment, levy and collection in the State of Ohio that R. C. 323.152(B) is constitutionally invalid.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R. C. 323.152(B) was enacted by the 113th Ohio General Assembly as a part of Am. Sub. H. B. No. 204.  It provides, in relevant part, that: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Real property taxes on a homestead shall be reduced for each year for which the owner obtains a certificate of reduction from the county auditor under section 323.154 of the Revised Code.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because R. C. 319.301(B) specifically speaks in terms of authorizing a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ten-percent &quot;reduction&quot; in taxes on all real property in this state, the effect of R. C. 323.152(B) is to provide a further &quot;reduction&quot; in real estate taxes of two and one-half percent for &quot;homesteads,&quot; as that term is defined in R. C. 323.151(A). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The provisions of R.

The homestead shall include so much of the land surrounding it, not exceeding one acre, as is reasonably necessary for the use of the dwelling or unit as a home.  An owner includes a vendee in possession under a purchase agreement or a land contract, a mortgagor, one or more joint tenants with right of survivorship, and tenants in common.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The relator argued that Ohio Const. art.

The court held that &sect; 323.152(B), which rolled back or partially exempted real property taxes on &quot;homesteads&quot; as defined within &sect; 323.151(A), was not in violation of Ohio Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause arises from the dismissal of a complaint for expungement filed on June 19, 1978, by appellee, Albert Darrell Barker, in the Court of Common Pleas of Portage County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his complaint, appellee averred that he was convicted on January 20 and April 10, 1956, for armed robbery in two counties in West Virginia.  The complaint indicated that the offenses for which he was convicted occurred at the same general location and time span.  It stated further that on July 20, 1960, appellee was discharged from parole by the West Virginia authorities, whereafter he apparently began his residence in Ohio. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;The record, which is not fully developed because the action was dismissed in its preliminary stages, fails to establish either the date when appellee commenced his residence in this state, or the duration of that residency.  Appellee has averred in his complaint for expungement that at the time this action was filed, he was a resident of Portage County, Ohio.  We note further that appellee's assertion before this court that his residency commenced after he was discharged from parole in 1960, has not been challenged by appellants.  Furthermore, appellants' motion to dismiss this cause in the trial court concedes that &quot;[t]he only connections the plaintiff has to * * * Ohio, is his residence in Streetsboro, Ohio.&quot; Accordingly, we conclude for purposes of deciding the questions of law presented that appellee has established a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">bona fide</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> residence in Ohio.  The extent to which appellee would have to establish this fact and other matters concerning his entitlement to expungement, as a prerequisite to the exercise of the Court of Common Pleas' discretion under R.

Appellee argued further that such court possessed a &quot;greater interest&quot; in this cause than in any other, and also had &quot;the right to seal the records as they relate to Ohio.&quot; The trial court, upon determining that the statutory provisions of R.

Therefore, notwithstanding the inability of Ohio courts to order extraterritorial authorities to physically expunge such records of conviction located without this state, Ohio sentencing courts have jurisdiction to &quot;expunge convictions from other states as they apply to their use in Ohio.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 4, 1976, the city of Parma passed ordinance No. 83-73, which provides that all city employees who are members of reserve components of the armed forces are entitled to 31 days of leave of absence each calendar year for field training or active duty.  Further, the ordinance provides that &quot;[i]f a city employee's military pay or compensation during such period of leave of absence is less than his city pay would have been for such period, he shall be paid by the city the difference in money between the city pay and his military pay for such period.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 15, 1977, appellees, Northern Ohio Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and five members of the Parma Police Department, filed an action against the city, its mayor and its council president (appellants herein), and the state Attorney General, seeking declaratory relief and money damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action challenged the validity of the Parma ordinance and the authority of the city, a non-chartered municipality, to adopt such an ordinance which is alleged to be at variance with R. C. 5923.05. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees, under the purview of R. C. 5923.05, allege that they are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entitled to a leave of absence from their respective duties without loss of pay for such time as they are in the military service on field training or active duty for periods not to exceed 31 days in any calendar year.  In essence, appellees maintain that, by virtue of R. C. 5923.05, which permits municipal employees a military leave of absence without loss of pay, they are entitled to their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">full salaries</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during such leave, notwithstanding the ordinance, which provides that the city should pay only the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">difference</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> between the city pay and the military pay for such periods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 4, 1977, the city responded by filing a motion to dismiss appellees' complaint, alleging that the statute and ordinance are not in conflict and, alternatively, that the city has the authority to adopt conflicting legislation under its Home Rule power, Section 3 of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees filed an answer brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss, and the city filed a reply brief.  On August 1, 1977, the trial court held that the ordinance &quot;is not unconstitutional, nor is it in conflict with Ohio Revised Code Section 5923.05.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 11, 1977, appellees timely filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals.  On February 8, 1979, the appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded this matter to that court for disposition of appellees' money damages claim, which was never ruled on by the trial court. </SPAN></P>

At issue was the validity of the ordinance, which was alleged to be at variance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5923.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellees, a patrolmen's benevolent association and police officers, challenged the ordinance, which provided that city employees who were members of the armed forces reserves were entitled to 31 days of leave, but that an employee would only be paid its city salary to the extent that a shortfall existed between the employee's military and city pay. Section 5923.05 provided for the same amount of leave but without any loss of pay. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The statute and the ordinance were directly in conflict and not capable of a reasonable construction that would harmonize the two. Municipal power was derived from the Ohio Constitution and not from a charter. The city, a non-chartered municipality, had authority, pursuant to its Home Rule powers, to enact an ordinance that conflicted with the general laws of Ohio when the ordinance was limited to a matter of substantive local self-government. The ability to determine the salaries to be paid to city employees was a fundamental exercise of substantive local self-government power.</SPAN></P>

The board had determined that the appellee's nominating petition was invalid and had removed his name from the ballot for the reason that, as a resident of the village of Bratenahl, appellee would be ineligible to serve as a member of the county board of education if elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 5, 1979, the Court of Appeals granted the writ of mandamus and ordered the board of elections to place appellee's name on the ballot as a candidate for the Cuyahoga County Board of Education at the November 6, 1979, election.

The employee argued that because the court's statement was not in a syllabus, the language was of no effect. He insisted that the controversy was alive because the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.29, the statute empowering the state board to dissolve the school district, was under attack in a pending case. The court reversed the grant of the writ. The determination that the school district was dissolved was a sine qua non underpinning to the court's syllabus in the prior case. An allegation of unconstitutionality of a statute in a case pending in a lower court was not justification for overturning a the court's prior determination.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 14, 1977, Blue Cross of Northwest Ohio (hereinafter &quot;Blue Cross&quot;) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filed with the Department of Insurance a request for an average rate increase of 35.9 percent for its non-group subscribers, effective March 1, 1978.  On November 29 and 30, and December 1 and 2, 1977, the department held public hearings on the merits of this request, as authorized by R. C. 1739.051(D).  Similar hearings were held in February 1977, which resulted in a rate increase for Blue Cross, effective April 30, 1977.  At the close of the November-December hearings, the hearing officer concluded that Blue Cross was not in complete compliance with R. C. 1739.01(M) and Department of Insurance Rule 3901-1-28 (Ohio Adm. Code 3901-1-28), and recommended that the average rate increase be limited to 25 percent.  Pursuant to his authority under R. C. 1739.051(D) to disapprove Blue Cross' rate request if, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blue Cross failed to &quot;show by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence * * * [that it was] exerting a good faith effort to control costs,&quot; the Superintendent of Insurance, by final order dated January 6, 1978, rejected the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing officer's recommendation and denied the entire proposed rate increase. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;A Blue Cross plan is a hospital service association and thus regulated under R.C. Chapter 1739, and not under R.C. Title 39 as are commercial insurance companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As provided for in R. C. 1739.051(D), Blue Cross appealed this order to the Court of Common Pleas.  The court found Blue Cross to be in substantial compliance with the relevant provisions of R. C. Chapter 1739 and Rule 3901-1-28 &quot;since it * * * demonstrated by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that it has made [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] a good faith effort to control costs * * * charged to it by member health care facilities, including hospitals.&quot; Therefore, pursuant to R. C. 119.12, the Court of Common Pleas vacated the superintendent's order, and ordered an average 30 percent increase in Blue Cross' non-group rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals sustained the trial court's finding, but adjusted the approved rate increase upward to an average 35.9 percent (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blue Cross' entire request).  Alternatively, the Court of Appeals ruled that the discretion given the superintendent by the statute and rule was unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant, Ohio Superintendent of Insurance, maintained that appellee insurer's proposed rate increase should have been disapproved for failure to comply with requirements of Ohio Rev.

The statute also required use of financial incentives and disincentives. In fact, the court reasoned that appellee's compliance with &sect; 1739.01(M) depended primarily on use of financial incentives and disincentives. Appellee argued that &sect; 17393.01(M) was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The court disagreed because the legislature provided as much guidance as was practical.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 31, 1972, the Lancaster Colony Corporation and its five subsidiaries, appellants herein, filed a declaration of estimated corporation franchise tax for the 1972 report year and remitted $ 66,368.22 to the Treasurer of State.  On or about March 27, 1972, appellants filed requests for extension of time for filing their corporation franchise tax and, at the same time, remitted an additional $ 66,335.21 to the Treasurer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about May 30, 1972, appellants filed a combined corporation franchise tax report for the 1972 report year and computed their franchise tax on the &quot;net income&quot; rather than the &quot;net worth&quot; method, since the net income method resulted in a greater tax liability, as required by the 1971 amendment to R.C. 5733.05. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants applied for and received a refund of $ 4,116.47, plus interest, because their estimated payments were greater than their reported liability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 30, 1975, the Tax Commissioner, appellee herein, assessed appellants an additional $ 9,349.57, including penalty and interest, for their franchise tax for the 1972 report year.  On May 29, 1975, pursuant to R.C. 5733.11, appellants paid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the assessment and contemporaneously filed an application for review and correction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the Tax Commissioner issued a final determination on appellants' application, this court held, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Lakengren </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Kosydar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 199, that the 1971 amendment to R.C. 5733.05, which requires a corporation to calculate its franchise tax by the &quot;net income&quot; method rather than the &quot;net worth&quot; method if it results in a greater tax liability, is unconstitutional as applied to a corporation whose accounting year ended prior to the effective date of the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Lakengren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision, appellants, on February 6, 1976, filed an amended application for review and correction, requesting the commissioner to reduce their combined 1972 franchise tax liability by $ 104,201.73, the difference between the amount they had paid under the &quot;net income&quot; method, including the $ 9,349.57 assessment, and the amount they alleged they should have paid according to the &quot;net worth&quot; method, plus interest.  On the same date, pursuant to R.C. 5733.12, they filed an application for a refund of $ 104,201.73. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 5, 1977, the commissioner issued a certificate of final determination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regarding the application for review and correction.  The commissioner, relying upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Lakengren,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> determined that appellants' franchise tax should have been calculated on the &quot;net worth&quot; basis.  Accordingly, he allowed a refund of the $ 9,349.57 assessment of April 30, 1975, and promptly issued a certificate of final determination regarding the application for refund of $ 9,349.57.  However, the commissioner also determined, on April 5, 1977, that he lacked jurisdiction to consider the application for refund for the remaining $ 94,852.16, remitted to the Treasurer in 1972, because it was not filed within three years of the payment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to R.C. 5717.02, appellants timely appealed both orders to the Board of Tax Appeals.  The board determined that, when an application for review and correction is filed, pursuant to R.C. 5733.11, only the assessment itself may be challenged in that proceeding and, thus, that the commissioner properly determined that he lacked jurisdiction to consider a refund of the $ 94,852.16 since the application was not filed within three years of payment.  The final orders of the commissioner were affirmed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellee tax commissioner assessed appellants, a corporation and its five subsidiaries (taxpayers), a penalty for their franchise tax. The taxpayers filed an application for review and correction. The tax commissioner held that he lacked jurisdiction to consider the application because it was not filed within three years of the payment. The Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) confirmed that decision. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">In challenging the tax commissioner's refusal to issue them a refund on the ground that the refund application was untimely, the taxpayers asserted that because the tax commissioner recognized an overpayment of the April 30, 1975, assessment for the 1972 report year, he had a mandatory duty to refund the entire overpayment of the franchise tax for the 1972 report year, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.11, regardless of the date of payment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the tax commissioner did not have a mandatory duty to issue a refund of the entire overpayment, pursuant to &sect; 5733.11. According to the court, the mandates as to the amount and procedure of a refund were determined pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.12. The court further held that the three year time period ran separately from each remittance, and thus, because the 1972 remittances were made more than three years prior to the application for a refund, the refund application was not timely. The court emphasized that the three-year limitation of &sect; 5733.12 began to run anew against each illegal and erroneous payment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant, Laura Daniels, was indicted on two counts of endangering children in violation of R. C. 2919.22(A) and one count of involuntary manslaughter in violation of R. C. 2903.04.  These charges stemmed from appellant's alleged delinquent care of her twin sons.  Evidence indicated that the two boys were malnourished from birth, causing the death of one of the twins.  The other twin survived but was severely undernourished and suffered from multiple bodily lesions.  Testimony also established that the appellant was a chronic alcoholic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, appellant moved to dismiss the charges under R. C. 2919.22(A), contending that this statutory section was unconstitutional.

On review, the court affirmed, finding that defendant made no claim that her actual conduct toward her children could not be regulated under &sect; 2919.22(A), and that her overbreadth challenge was invalid. According to the court, defendant did not fall within the overbreadth exception to the standing requirements because the freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life was not protected by the First Amendment's rights of association. In addition, the court noted that &sect; 2919.22(A) did not regulate expression or the right of assembly in any respect, but governed conduct that endangered children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Board of Tax Appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These appeals arise from a consolidated decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA) wherein the board reversed sales tax assessments levied by appellant herein, the Tax Commissioner, against appellees, Kay Lenart, William M. Caserta, and Glenn R. Tidrick.  The appeals were heard before this court on the same day and, because they involve common issues of fact and law, are consolidated for disposition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cases Nos. 79-291 and 79-292, Lenart and Caserta were informed by notice of tax assessment that they were personally liable, under the authority R. C. 5739.33, for unpaid sales taxes, penalties, and delinquency charges.  This liability allegedly resulted from the failure of American Airmotive, Inc. (Airmotive), the corporation with which appellees were associated, to remit sales taxes to the state of Ohio.  Subsequent to a hearing on these assessments, appellant concluded that Caserta was subject to liability for unpaid sales taxes during the period from March 12, 1970 6, July 6, 1973.  CAserta had held the position of Vice-President for Airmotive from March of 1970 until his resignation from that office in July or August of 1973.  Appellant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entry noted further that Lenart's liability also arose under the provisions of R. C. 5739.33, and involved unpaid sales taxes occurring from March 12, 1970, to October 26, 1972, and from May 20, 1973, to July 15, 1973.  The record demonstrates that Lenart served as the Secretary-Treasurer of Airmotive in 1970 and 1971, and then as Secretary of the corporation from 1971 until July of 1973. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees filed substantially identical notices of appeal with the BTA, challenging the determination of appellant and specifying, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that they were not personally liable for the sales tax assessments because all corporate &quot;sales tax return filings and payments were current&quot; prior to their resignations as corporate officers.  When appellees' causes came before the BTA for disposition, appellant objected to the admission of evidence relative to whether appellees' responsibilities as corporate officers placed them within the purview of R. C. 5739.33, contending that appellees' failure to raise that issue in their notices of appeal, as required by R. C. 5717.02, rendered the BTA without jurisdiction to consider it.  Citing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Abex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Kosydar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 13, 298 N.E. 2d&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  584, the BTA overruled appellant's objection.  The BTA reversed appellant's orders, finding that appellees' corporate responsibilities were insufficient to render them personally liable for the assessments in question. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 79-295, appellant issued three sales tax assessments against appellee, Glenn Tidrick, wherein Tidrick was held personally liable, pursuant to R. C. 5739.33, for unremitted sales taxes, penalties, and delinquencies owed by Airmotive and occurring between October 26, 1972, and December 5, 1974.  Subsequent to a hearing held before appellant, Tidrick's liability was upheld on the basis of his involvement as a corporate employee and officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record demonstrates that Tidrick was initially employed by Airmotive in May of 1972 as an accountant.  In November he was appointed Treasurer of the corporation, an office which he held until April of 1973.  On July 19, 1974, he was appointed Vice-President and Treasurer of Airmotive and was elected to the corporation's Board of Directors.  On December 5, 1974, Tidrick resigned his offices with the corporation, but remained as an employee.  In March of 1975, the corporation went into receivership. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tidrick appealed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the BTA from appellant's orders, alleging that appellant erred in finding him liable for the corporation's unpaid sales taxes because he at no time had the control of, supervision over, or responsibility for, filing sales tax returns or making the payments, within the meaning of R. C. 5739.33 or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Weiss </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Porterfield</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 117, 271 N.E. 2d 792. The BTA found that Tidrick did not come within R. C. 5739.33 and reversed the assessments levied by appellant. </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 5739.33. The Commissioner challenged the jurisdiction of the BTA to absolve the officers from tax liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Three officers were informed by two separate tax assessments notices that they were personally liable for unpaid corporate sales taxes, penalties, and delinquency charges. When the first cause came before the BTA for disposition, the Commissioner objected to the admission of evidence relative to whether the officers' responsibilities placed them within the purview of &sect; 5739.33, contending that their failure to raise that issue in their notice of appeal, as required by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5717.02, rendered the BTA without jurisdiction to consider it. In the second action, the Commission contended that one of the officers, the corporate treasurer, had direct responsibility for filing the taxes. The BTA overruled the Commissioner's objections and assessments, finding that each of the officers' responsibilities were insufficient to render them personally liable. On appeal, the court reversed both rulings because the BTA's decision was predicated upon a finding that was not presented in the notice of appeal, the treasurer admitted that he was aware of the corporation's statutory duty to remit all sales tax proceeds, and that he signed the checks when payments was remitted to the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claimant-appellee, Henry Salzl (hereinafter claimant), began working as a paper cutter for Gibson Greeting Cards, Inc. (hereinafter Gibson), in October 1958.  He worked for Gibson for a period of nearly 18 years until he was forced to retire at the age of 65 because of the company's mandatory retirement policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 1970, Gibson offered its employees a profit sharing plan which was financed through company contributions, although the employee was permitted to augment the plan with his or her voluntary contributions.  The claimant never made any voluntary contributions.  In 1970, Gibson adopted a pension plan which was also funded by the employer.  The terms of the pension plan called for mandatory retirement at age 65, and the plan took effect January 1, 1970.  The employees of Gibson were given notice of the contents of the plan through publication and distribution of a pension plan handbook.  This was the only notice they had since the company unilaterally adopted the plan, and the employees had no voice in the decision.  The funds in the profit sharing plan were used to finance a portion of the pension plan when&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the latter became effective. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the pension plan became effective, the employees had the option of resigning their position and withdrawing their profit sharing funds, or allowing the funds that were in the profit sharing plan to be transferred to the pension fund.  The claimant chose to allow his profit sharing funds to become incorporated into the pension plan.  In 1970, claimant's balance of funds in the profit sharing plan was $ 5,731.07.  When he terminated his employment with Gibson, the fund had appreciated to $ 7,600.  Instead of receiving a lump sum payment, claimant chose to receive a monthly pension of $ 187.95. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it had not been for Gibson's mandatory retirement policy, claimant would have continued his employment.  His request to continue working was denied.  After leaving Gibson, claimant actively sought employment elsewhere.  He was unsuccessful.  He then applied for unemployment compensation benefits.  Such benefits were initially denied by the administrator and were again denied on reconsideration.  On July 15, 1976, a hearing was held before a referee, and he ruled that claimant had not quit his job without just cause in connection with his work, under R. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C. 4141.29(D)(a), and therefore was entitled to benefits.  Upon further appeal, the Board of Review (appellant herein), following a hearing, determined that claimant was discharged for just cause in connection with his work and suspended his benefit rights.  This decision was summarily affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County.  The Court of Appeals reversed and held that the claimant was entitled to unemployment benefits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Summit County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">May Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court of appeals held, contrary to the Bureau and the common pleas court, that the claimant was entitled to unemployment benefits after being forced to leave his employment because of his employer's mandatory retirement policy. Upon certification for review and final determination, the court upheld the court of appeals' decision, finding it consistent with the Unemployment Compensation Act's intent. The court found a rational basis for distinguishing between an employee who leaves work pursuant to a pension and retirement plan that was negotiated by his union and accepted as part of his contract and an employee, such as the claimant, who is forced to leave his employment because of a unilaterally enacted pension program calling for mandatory retirement at age 65. The distinction provided the basis for the court's holding that the claimant was entitled to employment benefits, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause originated as an administrative licensing proceeding before the Division of Wildlife, Ohio Department of Natural Resources.  That division, in accordance with R. C. 1533.342 established a &quot;limited entry&quot; program for regulating the issuance of commercial fishing licenses on Lake Erie and elsewhere within Ohio.  Under this program the number of commercial fishermen was limited to control the size of the annual fish harvest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This licensing system was instituted by the promulgation of Section 1501:31-3-03 of the Ohio Administrative Code, which, as it stood in 1977, governed the proceedings in this cause.  Subsection (A) of Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-03, as a grandfather provision for this program, provided that those entities possessing a commercial fishing license in 1975 would be issued licenses in 1976 and thereafter if certain requirements were followed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issuance of new licenses was governed by subsection (B) of that regulation, which is the center of controversy in this cause. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-03(A) at the time this cause arose in 1977 provided, in its pertinent part, as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Except as provided in Division (B) of this rule, only those persons holding commercial fishing licenses in 1975, except trotline licenses, will be licensed to fish in 1976 and thereafter, provided they have made proper application and paid the required fees by March first of each year, and have complied with the necessary provisions in Chapters 1531 and 1533 of the Revised Code and division of wildlife orders in previous fishing seasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellees, Gerald Smith and Carl H. Smith, Jr., the applicants herein, fell within the grandfather provisions of this program and submitted a renewal application to the Division of Wildlife for a commercial fishing license for the year 1977.  The applicants, however, failed to comply with Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-03 (A) and thus lost their continued licensing status under the grandfather clause.  The applicants were thereafter treated as new license seekers and were placed at the top of a waiting list for such licenses.  No new licenses were granted in 1977. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicants challenged the adjudicative hearing that resulted in the denial of their application in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County, pursuant to R. C. 119.12.  That court affirmed the adjudicative order of the Division of Wildlife in all respects.  Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld that portion of the administrative decision which denied the applicants their preferential licensing status under Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-03 (A).  This determination is not now before this court.  However, the Court of Appeals also held that Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-03 (B) was impermissibly vague because it failed to establish&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  specific procedures for granting or denying licenses to new commercial fishing applicants.  Based upon this conclusion, the court further determined that the decision to deny the application in this cause was arbitrary and capricious.  The court went on to order the issuance of a new 1977 license to the applicants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 1501:31-3-03(B) failed to establish specific procedures for granting or denying licenses. The applicants alleged that the regulation gave unfettered discretion to the chief of the wildlife division in granting the licenses. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 1501:31-3-03(B) was valid because of extensive guidelines set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.342. The court found that the regulation when read in conjunction with &sect; 1533.342 revealed a legislative scheme adequate to safeguard against administrative capriciousness. Further, the court indicated that the applicants did not raise the issue regarding the limit on the number of new licenses issued, and therefore the Division of Wildlife was not required to demonstrate its compliance with the factors contained in &sect; 1533.342. The court concluded that Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 1501:31-3-03(B) was not impermissibly vague. The court determined that the Division of Wildlife's denial of a new license was not arbitrary under &sect; 1533.342.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl and Karen Heller, relators herein, are the natural parents of Johnny Steven Heller, born January 15, 1976.  Shortly after Johnny's birth, the Hancock County Children's Services Board filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Hancock County, Juvenile Division, seeking permanent custody of the child because he allegedly lacked proper care and support due to the physical condition of both the mother and father.  Pursuant to R. C. 215.352 and 120.33, the court determined that the Hellers were indigent and appointed counsel to represent them.  On October 23, 1978, the court issued an order which permanently terminated Earl and Karen Heller's parental rights to Johnny. </SPAN></P>

The writ of mandamus issued. The court held that the refusal to supply a transcript and to provide counsel constituted a trespass on the rights of similarly situated citizens in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The court found that there was no plain and adequate remedy at law available to parents in the case at bar. The court also found that the parents could not effectively appeal without a transcript and counsel. The court further found that if the parents continued pro se without benefit of a transcript, any appeal wold have been ineffectively presented. The court determined that the stipulated facts showed that the parents were indigent. The court ruled that neither the exclusion of frivolous appeals nor the desire to settle the child's fate quickly could justify depriving the indigent parents of the right to appeal when appellate review, as of right, was available to other parents in cases involving the involuntary, permanent termination of parental rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meeting at a laundromat in Zanesville on the evening of July 18, 1977, complainant, Christa G., age 13, and two female friends, both age 14, appellant, Gary D. Price, age 23, and a male friend of his decided to go for a ride.  The group purchased a six-pack of beer, traveled to a trailer where each consumed certain amounts of beer, and then left to purchase additional quantities of beer.  Next, the group picked up a second male friend of appellant and proceeded to Mount Sterling, where all went for a swim in a pond.  While in the pond, appellant asked Christa if she wanted to engage in sexual intercourse.  Upon her refusal, appellant threatened to drown her if she did not take a walk with him.  Christa then returned to the car with one of her female friends.  Shortly thereafter, appellant returned to the car, pulled Christa from the back seat to an area nearby behind some bushes, forced her to the ground, removed her pants, and raped her.  At this point, both Christa's female friends ran to assist her.  The group then returned to Zanesville where the three females were released.  Christa went home and told her family&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the incident.  The family went immediately to the sheriff's office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted for the offenses of rape, pursuant to R. C. 2907.02, and kidnapping, pursuant to R. C. 2905.01; and was separately indicted for the offense of corruption of a minor, pursuant to R. C. 2907.04. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon trial to a jury, appellant was convicted of both rape and kidnapping, with the jury finding further that the complainant was not released unharmed in a safe place.  The remaining charge was dismissed.  Thereupon, the trial court imposed identical concurrent sentences of from six to twenty-five years.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed both the rape and kidnapping convictions. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant challenged the intermediate appellate court judgment that affirmed his rape and kidnapping convictions. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of the victim's friend as a spontaneous exclamation. On appeal, the court determined that the testimony was properly admitted because it concerned events immediately following the alleged rape and consisted of the victim's statement to her friend that defendant had just raped her. Defendant also contended that he could not be convicted of both rape and kidnapping on the basis of identical evidence because the crimes were not committed separately. The court determined that the rape and kidnapping were neither committed separately nor with separate animus. The force by which defendant removed the victim from the car to engage in sexual conduct was indistinguishable from the force by which he used to restrain the victim of her liberty as required under the kidnapping statute. The court concluded that since the restraint of movement of the victim was merely incidental to the separate underlying crime of rape, there was no separate animus sufficient to sustain the kidnapping conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instant cause arises from a judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming a trial court determination that appellant, General Electric Company, is not entitled to recover interest on real estate taxes illegally or erroneously collected from it, and invested for a period of time by appellees, the Hamilton County auditor and treasurer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are undisputed.  For calendar years 1969, and 1971 through 1973, appellant was assessed and paid taxes on its real property located in Hamilton County on the erroneous basis of 1969 instead of 1962 year reproduction costs.  During the tax years involved herein, the tax valuation of most other real estate in Hamilton County was based on 1962 reproduction costs.  This distinction resulted in substantially and disproportionately higher real estate taxes to appellant than to other taxpayers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving adverse rulings on its administrative complaints, General Electric appealed to the Court of Appeals, alleging the discriminatory effect of appellees' method of valuation of General Electric's real property.  That court found violations of both the Equal Protection Clause and Section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2, Article XII, of the Ohio Constitution, requiring taxation to be uniform.  On remand, the board of revision recomputed the tax years involved and ordered a refund to appellant of $ 648,876.80, which amount represented those taxes illegally or erroneously collected.  Appellant demanded interest which the county had collected from investment of the erroneously collected taxes, or interest at the prevailing legal rate, but the county refused to pay.  Appellant then instituted this action in the Court of Common Pleas for recovery of the demanded interest.  It is noted that all parties agreed by stipulation to the amounts of assessments, investments and the interest involved. </SPAN></P>

In the absence of statutory authority, the tax collector, in his role as trustee of public funds, could not disburse any such funds beyond the bounds of his statutorily created trust.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Paul Tomasic, is a bingo operator for a bingo game conducted at the Lorain Catholic High School in Lorain, Ohio, on behalf of the Lorain Catholic High School Booster Club.  The game is fully licensed by the state of Ohio, pursuant to R. C. 2915.08, and is operated for a charitable organization as defined in R. C. 2915.01(H). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 30, 1978, appellant was arrested for paying out approximately $1,700 in prize money in violation of Ordinance 719.03(a) of the Lorain Codified Ordinances which prohibits the paying out of more than $1,200 in prizes during any single bingo session.  He plead &quot;not guilty&quot; and, on February 10, 1978, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the ordinance unconstitutionally conflicted with R. C. 2915.09(B)(5).

The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, holding that there was no restriction under Ohio Rev.

The court noted that in determining whether an ordinance was in conflict, the test was whether the ordinance permitted that which the statute forbade and prohibited and vice versa. The court reasoned that allowing ordinances to be enacted throughout the state reducing maximum pay outs would destroy a uniform application of the state statutory scheme and create a potential for emasculating a charitable organization's ability to conduct a lawful bingo operation. Such a construction of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.09(B)(5) would have rendered its language meaningless. Thus, the ordinance was unconstitutionally in conflict with state law.</SPAN></P>

After riding around in two groups using both McGowan's and Fenrick's cars, they all resumed their excursion in McGowan's car, during which time Ogletree allegedly forced Fenrick to submit to oral sex in the back seat of the moving auto.  Fenrick testified that she committed the act only because Gardner and the juvenile were pointing guns at her.  Soon thereafter police apprehended and arrested the occupants of the car on suspicion that gunshots had been fired therefrom.  A .38 caliber revolver was found in Gardner's pants pocket, and a .32 caliber gun was found under a blanket on the rear floor of the auto.  At the scene of the arrest, Fenrick told the police that she and Coar had been kidnapped. </SPAN></P>

The court determined that the evidence that the complainant had a reputation as a prostitute was not sufficiently probative of consent to outweigh the State's legitimate interests in excluding the testimony. Likewise, the defense attempts to impeach the credibility of the complainant by the reputation evidence and evidence of a specific solicitation were correctly prohibited by the trial court. Also, the admission of collateral evidence was correctly admitted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59. The evidence showed that handguns were used, that the victims were required to commit the same act, and that this occurred in the same residence from which the complainant was allegedly abducted the next day. Being so closely related in nature, time, and place to the offense charged, the evidence was relevant as tending to prove an intent to commit forcible rape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 22, 1974, by amended complaint, plaintiffs-appellees instituted a class action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.  The action was commenced on behalf of a plaintiff class comprised of an estimated 40,000 participants in either the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) or the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), who retired prior to October 16, 1972.  On that date, R. C. 145.56 and 3307.71 were amended so as to subject PERS and STRS retirement benefits to the state income tax levied by R. C. 5747.02. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees sought a declaratory judgment that the amendments to these sections, as applied to the plaintiff class, violated the provisions of Section 28, Article II of the Constitution of Ohio.  Appellees further demanded that an injunction issue restraining collection of the tax upon retirement benefits received by the plaintiff class, and that taxes previously paid on such benefits be refunded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Tax Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, lack of jurisdiction over the person, and for failure to state a claim.  The trial court granted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant's motion and dismissed the complaint.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.  This court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Herrick </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Kosydar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 128. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon remand, the trial court declared the amendments to R. C. 145.56 and 3307.71&nbsp;unconstitutional to the extent that they were found to operate retrospectively.  In addition, the court enjoined the levy and collection of the state income tax upon retirement benefits vesting prior to October 16, 1972, and ordered appellant to compute the amount of taxes wrongfully collected in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals, with one judge dissenting, affirmed those parts of the lower court's judgment which struck down the amendments to the statutes and enjoined the levy and collection of the state income tax upon retirement benefits received by the plaintiff class.  However, the court reversed that portion of the judgment which ordered appellant to compute the amount of taxes theretofore collected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The causes are now before this court pursuant to the allowance of defendant's motion to certify the record in No. 78-1020, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and of plaintiffs' motion to certify the record in No. 78-1047.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Cross-appeals were taken from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which affirmed the lower court's judgment that found amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 145.56, 3307.71 invalid and enjoined the levy and collection of the state income tax upon plaintiff retirees' benefits, while reversing a portion of the judgment that ordered defendant tax commissioner to compute the amount of taxes theretofore collected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The retirees contended that they had a vested right to receive their retirement benefits exempt from the state income tax. Prior to the date of the challenged amendments, the retirees' benefits were by statute exempted from all state taxes. The court held, however, that a tax upon income realized after the effective date of the amendments was not retrospective in nature.Moreover, the vesting provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 145.561, 3307.711 prohibited only a reduction in the rate of payment, not the imposition of a tax.Accordingly, the court concluded that the imposition of the state income tax upon retirement benefits that were vested prior to the effective date of the amendments did not impair a vested right of the retirees, nor did it constitute a retroactive tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leland Sammons, appellant herein, was charged in the Hamilton County Municipal Court with three violations of R. C. 2919.22(A), endangering children.  At his trial, it was adduced that on August 9, 1977, appellant's wife &quot;disciplined&quot; three of their sons, aged nine, ten and eleven, by applying heated scissors to their backsides.  Appellant was asleep in the same room at the time, but apparently was awakened by the noises of the second child being harmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the children's testimony, appellant asked his wife what was burning, and when he discovered what she was doing, he told her to stop, but then began laughing.  Appellant's wife then branded the third child while appellant looked on, taking no action to restrain her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and his wife did nothing to care for the burns until the children complained of pain several days later.  At that time, an unspecified ointment was applied to the burns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after the boys had run away from home and had been found by police were their burns treated by a physician.  One of the examining physicians testified that each of the boys had sustained &quot;moderately severe&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  burns which had penetrated all three layers of the skin.  The other physician testified that, in his opinion, the burns required immediate medical attention for the risk of infection was substantial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury found appellant guilty as charged and judgment was entered upon the verdicts.  Appellant appealed the judgment, contending, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that R. C. 2919.22(A) is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  The Court of Appeals rejected his contention and affirmed the judgment. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The trial court convicted defendant of three violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.22(A), endangering children, after he watched his wife brand their children and did nothing to intervene. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, defendant claimed that &sect; 2919.22(A) was void for vagueness and overbreadth under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.22 provided, in part, that no person, being the parent of a child under eighteen, was to create a substantial risk to the health or safety of such child by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. To have stood by and done nothing to prevent the torturous branding of one's children, and then continue to stand by and do nothing to see that the wounds inflicted were properly medically treated, met no standard, however abysmally low. Whatever the color of the collar, a generally acceptable standard of societal attention to the needs and care of offspring was not difficult of either determination or application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 1, 1977, appellant, Richard E. Cross, was arrested on a charge of aggravated arson and detained in the Belmont County jail where he remained in lieu of bond while awaiting trial.  On December 23, 1977, he left the jail without authorization.  Appellant made his escape through a hole in a fire door that had been made by two other prisoners.  Appellant's reasons for leaving the jail were that &quot;[i]t was so cold in there, you couldn't stand it,&quot; &quot;[i]t was colder in there than it was outside,&quot; &quot;[t]hey did not have no heat,&quot; the jail &quot;hardly had any water,&quot; and because &quot;I didn't have no lawyer; didn't know anything about my case.&quot; Generally it can be said that the appellant felt that his health, safety and legal interests were being neglected by prison officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant fled to Mexico but returned to California and turned himself in to authorities on January 13, 1978.  Appellant waived extradition and was returned to the Belmont County Jail.  He was charged with violating R. C. 2921.34. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;R. C. 2921.34 reads: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(A) No person, knowing he is under detention or being reckless in that regard, shall purposely break or attempt to break such detention, or purposely fail to return to detention, either following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited period, or at the time required when serving a sentence in intermittent confinement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(B) Irregularity in bringing about or maintaining detention, or lack of jurisdiction of the committing or detaining authority, is not a defense to a charge under this section if the detention is pursuant to judicial order or in a detention facility.  In the case of any other detention, irregularity or lack of jurisdiction is an affirmative defense only if either of the following occurs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) The escape involved no substantial risk of harm to the person or property of another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(2) The detaining authority knew or should have known there was no legal basis or authority for the detention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(C) Whoever violates this section is guilty of escape, a felony of the fourth degree.  Sentence of confinement imposed for escape shall be served consecutively to any other sentence of confinement imposed on such offender.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On June 6 and 7, 1978, a jury trial was held on the escape charge, and appellant's counsel attempted to introduce and proffer certain grand jury reports and other evidence of alleged inhumane conditions at the Belmont County jail as a basis for asserting the affirmative defense of &quot;necessity&quot; or &quot;duress.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;The terms &quot;necessity&quot; and &quot;duress&quot; are distinct, yet are often used interchangeably and are often indistinguishable.  They share in common the fact that they provide an excuse, justification or affirmative defense to a criminal charge.  Running throughout their meanings is the theme that imminent, immediate danger or threat of danger prevents the actor from exercising his own will, and that there is no alternate path to take.  Therefore, the actor is forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">As evidence of the interchangeability, the defense has been variously termed as: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coercion, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Syck </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> (1973), 130 Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant argued that the jury should have been instructed concerning the common-law defense of necessity and that the phrase &quot;in the case of any other detention,&quot; found in Ohio Rev.

Reviewing defendant's allegations on the jail conditions, the court found no specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack, or substantial bodily impairment in the defendant's immediate future. At most, the evidence revealed that defendant had a common cold. The court held that undesirable prison conditions were not sufficient to justify an escape or make one necessary. The defendant made no complaints to the authorities about the conditions, that he had ample time and means to resort to the legal system, and that he had not immediately turned himself in after his escape. Because escape was not the only viable choice available to defendant, he was not entitled to present evidence on the defense of necessity. Section 2921.34 was sufficiently clear and unambiguous in defining the prohibited activity and not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Board of Tax Appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dayton Power &amp; Light Company (D P &amp; L) is an Ohio corporation with its general business offices located in Dayton.  It is an investor-owned utility distributing electricity and gas in West Central Ohio and steam in downtown Dayton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an Ohio utility, the company is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio as well as the general regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's service area consists of about 6,000 square miles encompassing approximately 1,300,000 residents.  In order to operate its steam and electric generating plants the company consumes a considerable amount of coal from outside sources because it owns no coal mines itself.  During the year 1977 the company purchased coal for its Ohio generating plants from Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia.  The company received shipments of 7,335,640 tons of coal, of which 2,108,040 tons came from Ohio mines and 5,227,600 tons came from mines in Kentucky and West Virginia.  During that same year the company burned over 6,494,553 tons of coal for which it paid in excess of $150,000,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purchase&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of such vast quantities of coal for both immediate use and in order to maintain a normal 60-70 day stockpile at each of its generating stations, represents the company's most significant single category of operating expense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D P &amp; L owns two coal-fired electric generating stations known as the F. M. Tait and O. H. Hutchings Stations located in Montgomery County, as well as two coal-fired steam production plants situated in downtown Dayton.  Due to strict federal environmental regulations the company has become increasingly aware of sulphur oxide emissions emanating from its coal-fired generating stations.  The emissions are created by the oxidation of sulphur in the coal during the combustion process, and the higher the sulphur content, the greater the proscribed emission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of these sulphur emission restrictions, the company has been forced to burn coal having a low sulphur content.  Specifically, the coal burned at the company's Tait and Hutchings Stations cannot exceed 0.7 percent sulphur, based on 12,000 BTUs per pound.  Likewise, the restriction of sulphur output imposed upon the Dayton Steam plant is 1.0 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D P &amp; L, pursuant to R. C. 5751.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assessed an Ohio Coal Use Tax of $70,672.65 on the coal consumed in generating electricity and producing steam between the dates of December 14 to December 31, 1977.  On March 1, 1978, the Tax Commissioner denied the company's objections to the tax and an appeal was perfected to the Board of Tax Appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the board, D P &amp; L challenged the constitutionality of the coal tax by asserting that it imposed a discriminatory tax on interstate commerce and impermissibly burdened such commerce in violation of Section 8, Clause 3, of Article I of the United States Constitution.  No objection was raised concerning the actual calculations of the tax assessed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board affirmed the assessment and concluded that because it was merely an administrative agency, limited in its statutory authority, it lacked jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of the statutory scheme. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant corporation challenged a decision by the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which found that appellee tax commissioner (commissioner) properly assessed coal use tax against the corporation pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5751.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The corporation was an Ohio utility company and was assessed a coal use tax by the commissioner. The corporation challenged the decision contending that the assessment of the tax violated the Commerce Clause. The court found that based on a review of the rate structure embodied in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5751.02, the economic reality of Ohio's coal industry, and the geographic location of low sulfur coal in that part of the country, a discriminatory effect was imposed upon interstate commerce by the application of the tax. The court found that those who bought the local product were rewarded in the form of a lower tax rate, while those who did not buy the local product had to suffer the burden of a higher tax rate. Therefore, the court found that the Ohio Coal Consumption Tax, as imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5751.02, was in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly in Section 1 of Am. Sub. H. B. No. 230 enacted R. C. 4905.70, effective October 9, 1977.  That section required the Public Utilities Commission (commission) to promulgate a rule compelling each electric light company to offer &quot;demand&quot; or &quot;load&quot; metering to those residential customers whose homes are primarily heated by electricity and to provide rate tariffs reflecting the lower cost of service during off-peak periods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission adopted Rule 4901:1-10-01, Ohio Adm. Code, which complied with the mandate of R. C. 4905.70.  Subsequently, by entry of February 8, 1978, the commission ordered &quot;municipally owned and operated electric light companies and not-for-profit electric light companies&quot; to file tariffs in accordance with the rule, or show cause why they should be exempted from its requirements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 6, 1978, appellant city of Columbus filed a response, asserting that the commission's assumption of jurisdiction over municipal electric light companies was proscribed by the Constitution of Ohio.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Ohio Rev.

The Commission adopted a rule, Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4901:1-10-01, which complied with the mandate of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.70. The City and Association claimed that &sect; 4905.70 conflicted with Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 4905.70 contravened Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4 to the extent that it purported to apply to municipal electric light companies. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.70 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4901: 1-10-01 imposed a direct and substantial restriction upon the City and Association's operation of municipal electric light companies. By attempting to subject the rate structures of the companies to control of the Commission, the general assembly overstepped the line drawn by the Ohio Constitution. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.70 (1977) could not, in balancing the interests of the State and of local communities, be supported as an exercise of a valid state police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Columbus, appellee and cross-appellant herein, intends to construct a 90 megawatt refuse and coal fired electric generating plant, a &quot;major utility facility&quot; as that term is defined in R. C. 4906.01(B)(1). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio Power Siting Commission and its individual members, appellants and cross-appellees herein, upon learning of appellee's intentions, notified appellee's mayor by letter, dated December 30, 1975, that the commission possessed jurisdiction over the intended construction pursuant to R. C. Chapter 4906.  The letter further stated that appellee must, by rule, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> file a Letter of Intent with the commission at least two years prior to the anticipated commencement of construction, and at least one year before construction begins appellee must file an application for a certificate with the commission identifying the need for, and environmental impact of, the intended facility, pursuant to R. C. 4906.06. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Appellants' regulation PSC-5-01(A) requires those who must obtain a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to file a Letter of Intent with the commission at least one year prior to the anticipated submission of an application for said certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellee filed neither a Letter of Intent nor the application for a certificate with the commission.  Instead, appellee initiated a declaratory judgment action on May 12, 1976, in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, seeking to have R. C. 4906.01, 4906.03, 4906.04, 4906.06, 4906.10, 4906.13 and 4906.15 declared unconstitutional.  Appellee essentially alleged in its complaint that these statutes unlawfully infringe upon a municipality's &quot;home rule&quot; powers, as provided for in Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7 of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, by requiring municipalities to obtain commission approval for construction of a major utility facility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants denied the allegations of unconstitutionality in their answer and further sought by counterclaim, a writ of mandamus and, or, a mandatory injunction requiring appellee to comply with R. C. Chapter 4906.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In answer to appellants' counterclaim, appellee admitted its failure to file a Letter of Intent and application for a certificate, but justified the failure on the basis that the municipality's home rule authority relieved appellants of these obligations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held the statutes unconstitutional.  On appeal, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court of Appeals for Franklin County found only those provisions in the statutes unconstitutional which entitled the commission to determine questions of necessity, public interest and convenience in deciding whether to issue a certificate.  Those statutory provisions relevant to the environmental impact of proposed facilities were upheld, however, as an appropriate exercise of legislative regulatory power over matters of state-wide concern.  The court also denied appellants' request for injunctive relief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants have appealed to this court from that portion of the judgment below which held in favor of appellee.  Appellee has cross-appealed as to the other issues. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant power siting commission sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which found certain provisions of the relevant statutes unconstitutional. Appellee city had initiated this declaratory judgment action in the court of common pleas seeking to have Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The power siting commission had requested that the court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the city to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4906. The issue in this cause involved the legislature's inherent constitutional authority to exercise the police power and the city's constitutional right to construct, own, and operate a public utility. The city argued that the home rule authority conferred by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4 prevented the commission from reviewing the proposed construction with regard to the matters specified in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4906.10(A). The court held that to permit the power siting commission to determine the city's need for a utility, as well as the public service to be provided by, and convenience of, the facility constituted a direct and substantial interference with the city's home rule authority under Section 4 of Article XVIII. Accordingly, the court held that these portions of the questioned statutes were facially unconstitutional. However, the court would not issue a writ of mandamus because the state failed to establish that its environmental interests could not be adequately protected by the city's compliance with other state statutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed an order of the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision revaluing appellants' property pursuant to R. C. 5715.19. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic facts herein are that on May 14, 1973, the appellants, William and Patricia Meyer, in an &quot;arm's-length&quot; transaction, purchased two parcels of residential real property located in Gates Mills, the purchase price being $ 120,000.  The value of the property on the tax duplicate at the time of the sale was $ 43,410, such value having been established by the county auditor at the 1970 sexennial reappraisal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 18, 1974, the Board of Education of the Mayfield City School District filed a complaint with the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision, pursuant to R. C. 5715.19, requesting that the assessed value of the Meyer property for the tax year 1973 be increased in accordance with the $ 120,000 purchase price for the property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board of revision, on June 11, 1974, issued its decision increasing the assessed value of the property to $ 120,000.  Upon authority of R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The property owners argued that it was basically unfair for the Board to adopt the purchase price method of evaluating their property for tax purposes while not requiring the auditor to revalue other surrounding properties on the same basis. On appeal, the court disagreed. The owners did not show that the common level of assessment in the county was not applied to their real property for tax purposes, and therefore, they failed to show a violation of the uniform rule of Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. The Board of Tax Appeals' rules that were used to assess the prior value of their property and surrounding properties were a summary of considerations used to approximate an arm's-length sale where no such sale had taken place. Where there was an open market sale of the property, the purchase price was the best evidence of the value of the property and reasonably superseded any evidence based solely upon an appraisal by Board of Tax Appeals' rules. The record simply failed to establish either an intentional, systematic undervaluation of property in the county or a systematic or deliberate attempt by state officials to discriminate against the owners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County as a declaratory judgment action on April 5, 1976, seeking to have the Ohio system of financing public elementary and secondary education declared unconstitutional under the Ohio Constitution.  The trial court decided that the cause was a proper class action, and the following constitute the parties plaintiff: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A) The Board of Education of the City School District of the City of Cincinnati; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was commenced on December 6, 1976, and consisted of 78 days of testimony, including the testimony of approximately 77 witnesses and the introduction of approximately 2,400 exhibits.  The record consists of 7,530 pages of transcript. </SPAN></P>

Therefore, the school districts were being provided, in an equal manner, sufficient funds to properly educate and operate their programs. Further, the court held that the Assembly was under a statutory duty to provide efficient school systems throughout the State.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 22, 1976, Kenneth Phipps, the defendant-appellee herein, was convicted of the charge of importuning under R. C. 2907.07(B). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence admitted at trial discloses that, on October 27, 1976, the defendant stopped his car at a downtown corner in Cincinnati and said to the only individual standing on a nearby sidewalk, a male adult, &quot;Hop in, let's go have sex.&quot; The stranger looked into the back seat and Phipps retorted: &quot;You look paranoid, come on in, I want to suck your dick.&quot; After the person got in the car, Phipps made the specific proposal again, along with some other conversation.  At this point, the stranger identified himself as a police officer and arrested the defendant.  At trial, the officer testified that he was offended by the defendant's remarks.  Upon this evidence, Phipps was convicted by the Hamilton County Municipal Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, defendant's conviction was reversed.  The Court of Appeals found R. C. 2907.07(B) to be in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as an overbroad restriction on speech.  The court held that Phipps' solicitation was protected speech, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that the prosecution had not established a sufficiently compelling state interest to justify the regulation of this speech activity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals also held the importuning statute to be unconstitutionally vague, as denying the defendant the due process rights secured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment. </SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that &sect; 2907.07(B) was not void for vagueness. There were sufficient definitions in the statute to give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited. The court further found that &sect; 2907.07(B) swept too broadly, and the state's interest in protecting unwilling hearers and a person's right to be &quot;let alone&quot; was not sufficiently compelling to warrant an infringement on otherwise protected speech. However, &sect; 2907.07(B) could be narrowly construed to proscribe only the &quot;fighting&quot; words category of unprotected speech. Therefore, defendant could be punished under &sect; 2907.07(B) if the solicitation inflicted injury, even if only emotional, or was likely to provoke the average person to an immediate breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal by Atlas Crankshaft Corporation, appellant, from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, appellee, affirming a final order of the Tax Commissioner, denying an application by appellant for a refund of corporate franchise taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio corporate franchise tax law, R. C. Chapter 5733, was substantially revised by legislation (Am. Sub. H. B. No. 475) adopted effective December 20, 1971.  Before this amendment, the 1972 franchise tax of a calendar year corporation would have been based on its net worth as of January 1, 1972.  Under the new law, the net income earned by such a corporation during the 12-month period from January through December 1971, if resulting in more taxes than net worth at January 1, 1972, would be the basis for computing 1972 franchise tax liability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant is an Indiana corporation licensed to do business in Ohio.  It is a major manufacturer of crankshafts and related items at its facilities in Fostoria, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, a calendar year taxpayer, maintains its financial books and records in accord with generally accepted accounting principles.  It computes its depreciation using the straight-line&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  method for its general books of account, but depreciates these same assets on the double-declining balance method for federal income tax purposes.  Appellant carried the difference between these two methods of depreciation on its books as surplus.  This difference, as of December 31, 1970, was $ 1,564,113. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant determined that its tax under the net income method was greater than under the net worth method and filed its 1972 franchise tax return using the former, pursuant to R. C. 5733.05.  After having done so, appellant filed an amended return claiming that it should be allowed to deduct the surplus figure from net income and thereby qualify for a greater refund.  Appellant's application was denied. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant taxpayer, a corporation, sought review of a decision of appellee Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) denying an application by the corporation for a refund of corporate franchise taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The corporation determined that its tax using the net income method was greater than its tax using the net worth method, and filed its 1972 franchise tax return using the former, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.05. The corporation then filed an amended return claiming that it was entitled to deduct a surplus from net income and thereby qualify for a greater refund. The application was denied. The corporation claimed that the amendment of &sect; 5733.05, effective December 20, 1971, insofar as it increased the franchise tax obligation of a corporation for that portion of an accounting year already passed, was void as a retroactive law in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court held that the amendment, by which the net income of a corporation was made an alternative basis for computing the corporate franchise tax, was not unconstitutional as a retroactive law, as applied to a corporate taxpayer whose accounting year was not yet closed at the time the amendment became effective. Since the tax year in question was not closed at the effective date of the statute, it was not unconstitutional to require the corporation to file its tax return pursuant to the amended &sect; 5733.05.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Marie Dudukovich, was employed by appellant, Lorain Metropolitan Housing Authority (LMHA), as an inspector of housing.  On April 29, 1977, the board of directors of appellant, at a regular meeting, resolved to terminate the employment of appellee.  Appellant listed five reasons for its dismissal of Dudukovich, which can be summarized as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Unsatisfactory performance of inspection; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) non-cooperation on eviction case bordering on insubordination; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) failure to show up for an inspection appointment with a tenant; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) miscalculation of rent owed by tenant; and </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) errors in work performance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee appealed her dismissal to the board of directors of LMHA, and a hearing was held before that body on May 23, 1977, during which appellant was represented by counsel.  The evidence presented at this hearing to support the charges against Dudukovich consisted of the unsworn testimony of the executive director of LMHA and a number of exhibits, all of which was offered without objection from appellee's counsel.  At the conclusion of this hearing, appellant affirmed its dismissal of Dudukovich. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;Although the record contains no explicit affirmance by the board of its dismissal of appellee herein, it is undisputed that an affirmance resulted from the May 23, 1977, hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellee subsequently appealed the May 23 decision of the board to the Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County by filing a notice of appeal with that court on May 31, 1977, and by sending a copy of said notice to appellant by certified mail on May 28, 1977. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reviewing the record compiled at the hearing, the Court of Common Pleas reversed the board's decision and ordered that appellee be reinstated in her position of inspector.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Plaintiff employee appealed her dismissal from the employ of defendant municipal housing authority. The trial court reversed the housing authority's decision and ordered that the employee be reinstated to her position. The Court of Appeals for Lorain County (Ohio) affirmed and the housing authority appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The housing authority challenged the trial court's assumption of jurisdiction and contended that the employee did not properly file a notice of appeal from an agency decision. The court considered the issue of whether the employee sufficiently complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.04 by mailing a copy of her notice of appeal to the housing authority. The court found that since there was evidence in the record that the housing authority did eventually receive the mailed copy of the notice, the question remained whether it received the notice within the 10 day time limit prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.07(B). The court held that because a copy of the notice of appeal was sent by certified mail to a destination within the same city five days prior to the expiration of the statutory time limit and the housing authority presented no evidence of late delivery, a presumption of timely delivery controlled and the trial court correctly assumed jurisdiction. The court further held that the trial court acted within its scope of review in reversing the decision of the housing authority to dismiss the employee and did not abuse its discretion in finding as it did.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal by the Office of Consumers' Counsel arises from a March 31, 1978, opinion and order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (commission) granting approximately $ 28.7 million in rate relief to the Columbus &amp; Southern Ohio Electric Company (company).  Both the company and the city of Columbus have also appealed from that order.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">C&amp;SOE </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">. Pub. Util.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbus &amp; Southern Ohio Electric Company provides electric service to some 431,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in all or parts of 25 central and southern Ohio counties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 30, 1977, the company filed with the commission a notice of its intent to submit an application for permanent rate increases, pursuant to R. C. 4909.18. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 23, 1977, the Council of the city of Columbus enacted Ordinance No. 881-77, which would have extended the rates then being charged by the company for an additional two-year period.  On June 23, 1977, the company rejected those rates established under Ordinance No. 881-77. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, on June 30, 1977, filed, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pursuant to R. C. 4909.34, a complaint and appeal from Ordinance No. 881-77, and submitted, concurrently, an application for an increase of $ 45,491,000 in rates for its jurisdictional customers outside Columbus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having previously set the test year as the 1977 calendar year, the commission, on August 24, 1977, found the application and complaint to be in conformance with its Standard Filing Requirements, set the date certain as June 30, 1977, and accepted the application for filing as of that date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 30, 1977, a written report on the results of the commission's staff investigation of the matters set forth in the company's application and complaint was filed with the commission.  Objections were timely filed to the staff report, including those of appellant, Office of Consumers' Counsel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public hearing was commenced on January 19, 1978, encompassing 24 hearing days and the testimony of over 30 expert witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission issued its opinion and order on March 31, 1978, granting $ 28,628,000 in rate increases to the company and substituting a new tariff schedule for Ordinance No. 881-77. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Office of Consumers' Counsel filed an application for rehearing on May&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1, 1978, which was denied by the commission on May 30. </SPAN></P>

The city and the electric company also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The parties' main dispute was over the allowance of construction work in progress (CWIP) in the rate base under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.15(A)(1). On appeal, the court affirmed as to the inclusion of the CWIP in the rate base, but reversed as to the failure to offset working capital by customer deposits. The court held that the Commission's discretion under &sect; 4909.15 to authorize a reasonable allowance for CWIP in a utility's rate base was a lawful delegation of the state's police power. But the Commission erred by failing to deduct customer deposits from the rate base under &sect; 4909.05(I) and (J), or, alternatively, by failing to offset working capital with customer deposits. The rationale for an offset was to permit investors to earn a return only on that property for which they supplied funds, not on funds contributed by customers, and customer deposits were relatively constant and available for investment as working capital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause arises from an original action in mandamus, filed in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, wherein Riverside Methodist Hospital, appellee herein, seeks to compel William T.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Wilson, appellant herein, was indicted by the grand jury on two counts of aggravated burglary under R. C. 2911.11(A)(3).  He pleaded guilty to both counts.  At his sentencing hearing, however, appellant requested that he be sentenced under the burglary statute,&nbsp;R. C. 2911.12, because of an alleged duplication between R.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio corporate franchise tax law, R. C. Chapter 5733, was substantially revised by legislation (Am. Sub. II. B. No. 475) adopted effective December 20, 1971.  Prior to this amendment, the franchise tax for a calendar year corporation was based on its net worth as of January 1 of each year.  Under the new law, the net income earned by such a corporation during the calendar year became an alternative basis (whichever results in higher taxes) for computing franchise tax liability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burke International Research Corporation (hereinafter Burke) is an Ohio corporation subject to this tax.  Pursuant to the revised law, it paid its 1972 franchise tax on the net income basis reflecting its operations for calendar year 1971, its annual accounting period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burke filed a claim for refund with the Tax Commissioner for the difference between the tax paid by it under the net income basis ($4,904) and the lesser amount payable under the net worth alternative ($2,683), the only measure of taxation prior to December 20, 1971.  Burke's claim for refund was denied by the commissioner.  Because Burke's taxable year ended after December 20, 1971, the commissioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  concluded that this court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Lakengren </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Kosydar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 199, did not apply and that Burke was not otherwise entitled to the requested refund.  The Board of Tax Appeals refrained from approaching the constitutional issues raised by Burke and affirmed the commissioner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon appeal as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant corporation sought review of a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed the decision of appellee Tax Commissioner denying the corporation a refund of part of the franchise taxes it paid for the year 1972 based on its net income for the calendar year 1971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">An amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.05, which became effective as of December 20, 1991, permitted the &quot;net income&quot; of a corporation to be used as an alternative basis for calculating that corporation's annual franchise tax. Prior to this enactment, the method of calculation was a corporation's &quot;net worth.&quot; The corporation in question had an accounting year which closed after the effective date of the amendment to &sect; 5733.05. It argued that it was entitled to a refund of the difference between the franchise tax collected for 1972, which was based on its net income in 1971, and the lower amount that would have been collected under the net worth method. It contended that, as applied in the present case, &sect; 5733.05 was a retroactive law violative of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. On appeal, the court noted that when an accounting year was open for a taxpayer, it was also open for a taxing authority. Therefore, the court held that the amendment to &sect; 5733.05 was not unconstitutional as a prohibited retroactive law as applied to a corporation whose fiscal year was not closed as of December 20, 1971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the Board's decision, which affirmed the Tax Commissioner's denial of the corporation's request for a refund of part of its 1972 franchise taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1965, plaintiff-appellee, Jay B. Bernardini, graduated from high school and entered Slippery Rock State College in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania.  During that same year he declared &quot;Education&quot; to be his major course of study and thereafter attended college continuously until January of 1967.  In that same year he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was honorably discharged on April 19, 1971, and returned to the pursuit of his college degree at Slippery Rock in September of 1971.  He graduated in August of 1974 with a Bachelor's Degree in Education. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, he applied for and received a teaching certificate from the Ohio State Board of Education.  In September of 1974 he was hired by the appellant, Board of Education for the Conneaut Area City School District, and commenced his duties as a teacher.  When he was hired the appellant placed him at the first step (level &quot;O&quot;) of its salary schedule. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 12, 1976, appellee filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Ashtabula County seeking a declaratory judgment that he was entitled to a category on the salary schedule which would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  credit him with his four years of military service.  He later filed a motion for summary judgment contending that he was entitled to the military service credit pursuant to the statutory language found in R. C. 3317.13 and 3317.14.  The appellant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment asserting that appellee was not entitled to the relief requested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 6, 1977, the trial court granted appellant's cross-motion for summary judgment.  In his opinion, the trial judge concluded that the military service credit, provided for in R. C. 3317.13, applied only to individuals who had both graduated from college and received their certification as teachers prior to entering the military. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 27, 1978, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered final judgment for appellee on his motion for summary judgment. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal by the state of Ohio, appellant, from a decision of the Court of Appeals, reversing the convictions of William Alvin Frost, appellee herein, who was indicted on 9 counts of selling securities without a license, in violation of R. C. 1707.44(A), and on 12 counts of selling unregistered securities in violation of R. C. 1707.44(C). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee is the president of Consumer Companies of America, Inc. (hereinafter CCA).  CCA, a corporation, was formed in 1971, at which time 1,000 shares of stock were authorized and issued, 250 to appellee.  The initial issue of shares was exempt from compliance with the Ohio Securities Act, pursuant to R. C. 1707.03(O). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During 1975 and 1976, appellee sold, either for himself or others, stock in CCA.  The stock sold was part of the original shares issued to appellee and three other persons.  All the stock was sold to persons listed as &quot;representatives&quot; of CCA.  None of the shares were sold to outsiders.  Appellee never registered any of the shares nor was he ever licensed as a salesman or broker of securities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, in essence, claimed that he had violated neither R. C. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1707.44(A) nor 1707.44(C), since the transactions were within the exemption contained in R. C. 1707.03(B).  R. C. 1707.03(B) states that the sale of securities by a bona fide owner, who is neither the issuer nor a dealer, is exempt if the sale is made in good faith and not done to avoid R. C. 1707.01 through 1707.45, and is not made in the course of repeated and successive transactions of a similar character. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, R. C. 1707.45 states that the &quot;burden of proof&quot; is on the party claiming the benefit of the exemption.  In accordance with R. C. 1707.45, the trial court instructed the jury that the appellee had the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in order to establish the exemption defense.  Appellee was convicted on 14 of the counts charged, and judgment was entered on the verdicts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause, stating that the trial court erroneously placed the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence upon the appellee contrary to R. C. 2901.05(A), which stated: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">the burden of proof</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> is upon the prosecution</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense is upon the accused.&quot; (Emphasis added.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate court held that the jury should have been instructed that the appellee had only the burden of going forward with evidence of a nature and quality sufficient to raise the exemption defense, citing this court's decisions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Robinson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 103, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Humphries</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 95.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 15, 1977, defendant, Herman Hoffman, was arrested by the city of Wooster police and charged in the Wayne County Municipal Court with &quot;recklessly caus[ing] inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another, by making unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture, or display, or communicating unwarranted and grossly abusive language to any person, contrary to Section 2917.11 of the Revised Code,&quot; a minor misdemeanor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record indicates that the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, for the following reason: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * due to prior holding of this court and our court of appeals that Wooster Ordinance is unconstitutional and language of statute is exactly the same.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No evidence was received by the trial court and no stipulations were offered and received. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals, in its opinion, refers to &quot;alleged facts for purposes of the motion to dismiss * * *.&quot; It appears from the record that the defendant stated the facts orally in his motion to dismiss.  Allegedly, the defendant was using profanity and making verbal threats over Channel 19 of his CB radio.  The Court of Appeals quotes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'* * * god damn assholes' and 'any son of a bitch that wants to do something about it, to come on down 30 at the Loudonville Exit.' There were words exchanged with other CB operators in the area.  The defendant also said 'that if any one wanted to shut him up, to come on down if they had guts enough'; and 'the cops are afraid to do anything to Wooster CB operators.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals found that the trial court had applied its decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Wooster </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Thompson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (July 6, 1977, No. 1478), unreported, and, further, agreed with the trial court's action in finding R.

On appeal by the State, the appellate court affirmed, holding that &sect; 2917.11 was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad on its face and certifying the record of the case for review and final determination of the constitutionality of the statute. On further appeal, the court held that a person could not be punished under &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) for &quot;recklessly causing inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another,&quot; by making an &quot;offensively coarse utterance,&quot; or &quot;communicating unwarranted and grossly abusive language to any person,&quot; unless the words spoken were likely, by their very utterance, to inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant wife sought damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle by appellee husband. The wife was a passenger in the motor vehicle operated by her husband at the time of the accident.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The wife sued her husband for personal injuries that she sustained in an automobile accident, alleging that her injuries resulted from his negligent driving. The trial court granted summary judgment to the husband on the ground that he was immune from suit by his spouse. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the husband. On appeal, the court upheld the court of appeals' decision, as clear precedent supported it. The interspousal immunity doctrine reasonably related to the legitimate state interest of fostering marital harmony and preventing fraud and collusion. The doctrine was different than the &quot;guest statute,&quot; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, which had been declared unconstitutional. It reflected the higher state concern for regulating marriage and the greater potential for fraud stemming from the marital relationship where an insured spouse stood to benefit personally from losing a lawsuit instituted by his spouse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Renalist, Inc., through its owner-manager, John L. Knight, and its branch-office managers, Ralph McLaughlin and Robert E. Watling, was involved in the business of both collecting and selling information concerning rental properties.  Once the information was collected by the corporation it was sold in the form of an agreement called a &quot;policy&quot; to prospective tenants for a fee and good for three months from the date of purchase. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective April 8, 1977, while the defendants were engaged in the foregoing activity, R. C. 4735.01 and 4735.99 were amended and newly enacted R.

C. 4735.01, which defines the term &quot;[r]eal estate broker&quot; was amended to include subsection (A)(10) which adds to the definition of broker an individual who: &quot;Collects rental information for purposes of referring prospective tenants to rental units or locations of such units and charges the prospective tenants a fee.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to regulate such activity the General Assembly saw fit to enact a new statute dealing with that subject in the form of R.

All contracts entered into pursuant to this section shall stipulate that any fee charged in excess of ten dollars shall be repaid or refunded to the prospective tenant, upon demand, but no sooner than thirty days after the contract has been entered into and no later than sixty days after the contract has been entered into, if he does not obtain a rental conforming to his specifications through the listing furnished by the licensee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The State challenged the judgments of the Court of Appeals for Summit County (Ohio), which, consolidating four cases for purposes of appeal, reversed defendants' convictions for acting as real estate brokers without a license pursuant to Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the appellate court's decisions had revealed a fundamental failure to adhere to the principles applicable to interpreting legislative acts, and that for that reason the conclusion that the amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.01, which added the definition of &quot;broker&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.01(A)(10), was unconstitutional was arrived at erroneously. The court held that defendants had not demonstrated a clear and palpable abuse of the legislative exercise pursuant to the police power in its enactment of &sect; 4735.01(A)(10). The court ruled that the effect of the decision and procedure followed was to disregard both the presumption of constitutionality to which the statute was entitled and the necessity of proving it to have been unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. The effect of such a procedure was to have inferentially placed an unlawful burden upon the state of Ohio to justify the constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, is incorporated in Delaware and involved primarily in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce.  The company's operations extend from the Anadarko Basin in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas northeasterly across Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and into Michigan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant owns a total of 6,695 miles of natural gas transmission pipeline in the United States of which 294.2 miles, or 4.39 percent, are located in Ohio.  The Ohio pipeline is comprised of four large diameter, high pressure lines with corresponding connections to various high pressure lateral lines which serve Ohio customers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for intrastate sales in Texas and Oklahoma and direct industrial, field and similar sales, appellant sells its natural gas pursuant to long-term contracts to investor or municipally-owned gas distribution systems or to pipeline companies.  Deliveries of natural gas in 1976 went to 132 customers; 126 were located in Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.  Only six such deliveries were made in Ohio to the Ohio Gas Company, the Toledo&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Edison Company, Dayton Power and Light Company, the East Ohio Gas Company, and two sales went to the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these &quot;sales for resale,&quot; the appellant makes direct industrial and commercial sales to three other customers in Ohio: the General Motors Corporation, Johns-Mansville Fiber Glass, Inc., and General Portland Incorporated.  In 1976, these &quot;direct&quot; sales amounted to 1.6 percent of appellant's total volume of gas sold in Ohio and less than .35 percent of its overall gas sales by volume. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a transporter and seller of natural gas in interstate commerce appellant is considered a &quot;natural-gas company&quot; within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act, Section 717a(6), Title 15, U.S. Code, and therefore subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (formerly the Federal Power Commission).  Not only is the appellant subject to federal regulation but its operations in Ohio result in its classification as both a &quot;natural gas company&quot; as defined in R.C. 4905.03 (A) (6) and a &quot;pipe line company&quot; under R.C. 4905.03(A)(7). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past the appellant has consistently followed the statutory procedures.  In 1974, it filed four applications for authority to issue its securities; it filed three in 1975 and four in 1976.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">3&nbsp;Paragraph seven of the commission's findings reads as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Increasing financing requirements have caused the applicant to file increased numbers of applications for authority to issue securities in recent years.  In addition to causing more paperwork for applicant, the requirement can potentially impede the financing plans of applicant by the Commission withholding its authority or causing a delay in the timing of an issue.  There is also a potential for conflict between the requirements Ohio imposes and the requirements imposed by other jurisdictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Due to its increased need for financing, the utility consistently applied to the Commission, pursuant to &sect; 4905.40, for its approval of the issuance of the utility's securities. The utility subsequently claimed that the prior approval statute imposed an undue burden upon interstate commerce in violation of the United States Constitution, so it filed an application for an order relieving it from the obligation to seek Commission approval, but the Commission dismissed the application. On appeal, the court held that because the utility only serviced a few direct customers in Ohio, its compliance with &sect; 4905.40 placed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. The court further held that subjecting the utility to such approval statutes could result in the application of conflicting multistate regulation of the utility's securities. The court also held that the Commission failed to present any overriding local interests that would justify the application of the statutory scheme to the utility.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeals before this court are a consolidation of four cases which originated in Cleveland Municipal Court.  The facts surrounding the convictions are similar and can be summarized as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case, detectives of the Cleveland Police Department entered adult bookstores during normal business hours where the appellants were employed as cashiers or clerks.  The police officers proceeded to the rear of the premises and viewed films in booths with coin-operated projectors of the &quot;peep show&quot; variety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having viewed the films and noted their location in the store, affidavits were drawn up describing in detail the sexual activity that took place on the screen.  The affidavits were presented to a Municipal Court judge who issued search warrants authorizing the seizure of both the films and the projectors.  The items were seized and the appellants arrested and charged with pandering obscenity in violation of R. C. 2907.32(A)(4). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each appellant received a jury trial in Cleveland Municipal Court.  The prosecution in each case consisted primarily of the testimony of the officers who had viewed the films and subsequently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  completed the affidavits.  In addition, each film was admitted in evidence and shown to the jury.  Pre-trial motions to suppress and dismiss were overruled as were motions for acquittal filed during the course of the trials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four appellants were convicted under the statute for pandering obscenity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court in all four cases. </SPAN></P>

The court held that knowledge of the character of the material was sufficient to sustain a conviction under Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause originated with a complaint for a declaratory judgment filed by Charles T. Carroll and his wife, Carole (plaintiff-appellees).  This complaint sought to have determined whether: (1) the additional utilization of their home as an Ohio Youth Commission approved foster home was in compliance with the applicable zoning resolution of Washington Township which permitted only single-family residential use; (2) the prohibition of the operation of this foster home pursuant to the zoning resolution would be unreasonable and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (3) a foster care facility approved by the state was subject to this zoning resolution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court found that the use of the facilities as a foster home was not permitted under the zoning resolution; that the application of this zoning resolution did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights; and that this was neither a state use of the property nor had the state excepted approved foster care facilities from a township's zoning resolutions.  With respect to the counterclaim filed by the Washington Township Zoning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commission, the Board of Trustees of Washington Township and the Washington Township Zoning Inspector, the trial court issued a permanent injunction.  In general, this injunction prohibits the operation of the approved foster care facility at plaintiffs' residence in violation of the zoning resolution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, 1977, plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Court of Appeals.  However, on January 25, 1978, plaintiffs filed a &quot;Motion to Remand Without Surrender of Jurisdiction to the Common Pleas Court * * * to Cure Jurisdictional Defect.&quot; The Court of Appeals subsequently entered a judgment which vacated the trial court's judgment for want of jurisdiction due to the failure to serve the attorney general, as required by R.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 9, 1969, Ronald Sechler (appellee herein) injured his back while employed by the Graber Construction Company.  Appellee's claim for benefits covering medical expenses only was filed on Form C-3 with the Bureau of Workers' Compensation (&quot;the bureau&quot;) on August 8, 1969, and was recognized by the Deputy Administrator on February 1, 1970. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee received treatments throughout the period beginning on July 13, 1969, and ending on August 6, 1975.  James H. Laubach, D. M., D. C., appellee's treating physician throughout the period, was compensated by the bureau for services rendered appellee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Doctor Laubach indicated on several of his fee bills submitted to the bureau's claims section that appellee suffered moderate permanent partial disability as a result of his back injury, appellee did not apply for temporary total, permanent partial, or permanent total disability compensation prior to July 9, 1975.  On December 31, 1975, more than six years after the date of his injury, appellee did file an application for the determination of the percentage of permanent partial disability on Form C-92. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court, and held that R. C. 4123.52, in limiting the jurisdiction of the commission to modify or change a claimant's award for medical benefits for a period of six years from the date of injury, as opposed to ten years from the date of last payment of medical benefits, unconstitutionally effected an unreasonable classification in conflict with Section 26, of Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The industrial commission dismissed his claim for lack of jurisdiction, and the trial court affirmed. However, the appellate court held that an unreasonable classification was created under &sect; 4123.52 in conflict with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, because it limited the commission's jurisdiction to modify a claimant's award for medical benefits for a period of six years from the date of injury, as opposed to 10 years from the date of last payment of medical benefits. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.52 had to be read in conjunction with Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.84, which provided written notice of the injuries had to be filed within two years of an accident. The court held that &sect; 4123.52 acted as a statute of limitations rather than create eligibility requirements.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case arises from the judgment of the Court of Appeals which, on September 29, 1977, affirmed the Court of Common Pleas grant of summary judgment to appellees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record in this cause shows that on July 13, 1972, appellee, as Governor of Ohio and acting with the advice and consent of the Ohio Senate, appointed appellant to the Industrial Commission of Ohio for a term beginning February 15, 1972, and ending August 13, 1977. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 6, 1976, pursuant to the authority vested in him by R. C. 4121.03, appellee caused to be delivered to appellant a &quot;Statement of Causes,&quot; which set forth reasons why appellant should be removed from the commission.  Appellant was charged with (1) inefficiency in office; (2) neglect of duty in office; and (3) malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance in office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to appellee's charges, appellant made a &quot;Demand for Hearing,&quot; which, in applicable part, stated: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * that the purported action of Governor Rhodes herein, on January 6, 1976, is violative of the rights guaranteed Stebbins and other public officers by Section 38 of Article II of the Constitution of Ohio, is unlawful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and is not in accordance with the statutory procedures for removal of public officers who have been appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Ohio as such procedures are set forth in Chapter 3 of the Revised Code of Ohio, specifically but not limited to, Section 3.04 of the Revised Code. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * that the aforesaid purported Order of Removal is illegal, unlawful, void and of no effect; * * * that pursuant to Section 38 of Article II of the Constitution of Ohio and Section 3.04 of the Ohio Revised Code, he is entitled to a hearing in the Senate of Ohio and that he may not be removed from office for cause until after such hearing in the Senate and until the Senate of Ohio acts on such purported removal and does or does not advise and consent thereto by roll call vote, the result of which is spread at large on the Journal of the Ohio Senate.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, appellant commenced in federal district court a declaratory judgment action seeking an order which would find R. C. 4121.03&nbsp;unconstitutional and a preliminary and permanent injunction which would restrain appellee from removing appellant from office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accordance with negotiations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conducted by both parties on the morning of March 4, 1976, appellant's counsel, by letter of the same day, notified Judge Duncan of the district court: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * I have received permission from my client to approve a consent entry, holding in abeyance all further proceedings in the above-captioned case, on the condition that the Governor immediately serve notice upon the Ohio Senate that he is seeking their advice and consent to remove Mr. Stebbins from his office * * * as provided by the provisions of Section 3.04 of the Ohio Revised Code.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consent entry was filed in the federal district court on March 23, 1976, which incorporated appellee's request and stayed the federal action until appellee determined whether to proceed under R. C. 3.04. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 6, 1976, appellee served upon the Senate a &quot;Request for Advice and Consent of the Senate, State of Ohio,&quot; for the removal of appellant from office.  Appellant was charged therein with ten separate and specific causes for removal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By letter dated May 17, 1976, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee notified appellant that hearings would be conducted in the matter of his removal, and that they would be held in a manner which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would afford appellant his right to due process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County for a declaratory judgment that R. C. 3.04 is unconstitutional, and for a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing appellant's removal from office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee were commenced on June 17, 1976.  It is undisputed that appellant was in attendance and was represented by four attorneys.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant appointed public official challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee state governor. The appointed official had filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The senate had voted to remove the appointed official from office after the governor set forth reasons why the appointed official should be removed. The appointed official alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3.04 should have been struck down because it allowed the senate to invade the province of the judicial branch of government by exercising judicial power in contravention of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 32. On appeal, the court held that the appointed official was fully accorded his due process rights. The court found that the power to remove was conferred upon the senate because Ohio Const. art. III, &sect; 21 expressly allowed the conferring of special appointive power upon the senate. The court noted that there was no constitutional infirmity in a provision that an officer whose appointment was made with the advice and consent of the senate could have his removal, for cause, similarly subject to the advice and consent of the senate. Further, the court noted that the power to consent to the removal of an official whose appointment was similarly made in no way constituted the exercise of the judicial power by the general assembly in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 1:30 p. m. on November 1, 1975, Otto H. Baum, as owner-manager of an apartment building located at 215 East University Avenue, Cincinnati, began to collect the November rent from his tenants.  It was his custom to carry large sums of money on his person while he collected rent in order to cash tenants' government checks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Baum approached the third floor apartment rented by appellant, Willie Johnson, appellant and his brother, Bobby Johnson, emerged from a stairway which led from the third floor to the attic, wearing ski masks.  Appellant, holding a .20 gauge, H. &amp; R single-shot sawed-off shotgun and a pair of handcuffs, indicated his intention to rob Baum and ordered him to hand over his wallet.  Baum refused to do so, advanced toward appellant and reached for the barrel of the shotgun.  A struggle for possession of the gun ensued during which the shotgun discharged, damaging a wall.  As appellant regained control of the shotgun, he struck Baum on the left side of his head with the weapon's barrel.  Baum then tore appellant's shirt and appellant again struck him on the left side of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  head with the barrel of the shotgun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Baum slumped to the floor, appellant and his brother placed one end of the handcuffs to Baum's right wrist and the other end of the handcuffs to the stairway railing.  Appellant then removed Otto Baum's wallet, containing approximately $500, from his pocket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and his brother placed their ski masks and the shotgun, which appellant had broken-down, into a paper bag and ran from the apartment building.  The two were seen running from the building by residents Carrie Steward, Dorothy Echoles and by Shirley Echoles, who had called the police after hearing the shotgun blast. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 1:47 p. m., Patrolmen Gary R. Viering and Ralph Ruwan of the Cincinnati Police Department arrived at the 215 East University address, where they found Otto Baum and freed him from the staircase banister.  Attempts to communicate with Mr. Baum were unsuccessful since he was in a semi-conscious to unconscious state.  Baum was bleeding from the head and vomiting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ambulance arrived at approximately 1:55 p. m.  The paramedics proceeded to administer first aid to Baum, and transported him to the emergency room of Cincinnati General Hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  examination by Drs. Ronald Hill and Charles Johnson included an X-ray which revealed that Baum had suffered a skull fracture.  The doctors dressed and sutured the left side of the patient's head and placed him in a recovery room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that evening, Dr. Michael Walus, chief neuro-surgery resident at the hospital, determined that the patient's physical condition was deteriorating.  He was becoming comatose and the right side of his body was nearly paralyzed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An angiogram was taken which revealed the presence of a blood-clot inside the skull and immediate surgery for the removal of the clot was ordered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the operation, in which the blood clot was successfully removed, the patient suffered a severe loss of blood and a brief cardiac arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 2, 1975, electronic monitoring devices used to measure brain activity, indicated brain death, although respiration was continued through artificial means.  On the following four days, further scanning of Mr. Baum's brain showed no activity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 6, 1975, Dr. Walus ordered that the oxygen supply to the respirator be discontinued and, shortly thereafter, Otto Baum was pronounced dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 16, 1975, appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and his brother were indicted by the Hamilton County grand jury on one count of aggravated murder, in violation of R. C. 2903.01(B) with specification as to that count under R. C. 2929.04(A)(7), and one count of aggravated robbery, in violation of R. C. 2911.01(A)(1).  The defendants were separately tried. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his own trial, appellant admitted his participation in the robbery and to his beating of Baum, but denied that he had intended to kill the victim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Walus testified at trial that Otto Baum &quot;died from massive head trauma.&quot; Dr. Robert Ritterhoff, deputy coroner for Hamilton County who examined the body of Mr. Baum, testified that the cause of death was a &quot;massive comminuted broken-up [skull] fracture&quot; resulting from the application of an external force.  Appellant offered no evidence to dispute the testimony of the physicians, except for the fact that Dr. Walus had discontinued the oxygen supply to the artificial respirator on November 6. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 3, 1976, the jury found appellant guilty as charged on both counts of the indictment and as to the specification to the first count. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the mitigation hearing held on June 14, 1976, the requisite psychiatric reports were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  submitted but no further evidence was presented. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determining that none of the mitigating circumstances enumerated in R. C. 2929.04(B) were present in the case, the trial court sentenced appellant to death on the aggravated murder count, and to 7 to 25 years imprisonment on the aggravated robbery charge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences on November 9, 1977. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause came before this court upon appeal as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant sought review of an order from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for aggravated murder, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B), with specifications as to that count under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7), and aggravated robbery, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant claimed that the State failed to prove that defendant purposely caused the death. On review the court found no error. The court noted that the determination of whether defendant had the required culpable mental state was made with a view to the totality of circumstances. The court held that it was a fundamental principle that a person was presumed to intend the natural, reasonable, and probable consequences of his voluntary acts. Defendant claimed that the beating was not the proximate cause of death because the doctor terminated the victim's oxygen supply. However, the court held that one who inflicted injury upon another was criminally responsible for that person's death, regardless of whether different or more skillful medical treatment might have saved his life. There was testimony that the victim's oxygen supply had been terminated after four days of testing showed brain death. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the juvenile court's unbridled discretion to determine which juveniles would be bound over for prosecution as an adult. Defendant was not entitled to death penalty review because his sentence had already been reduced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 7:00 p. m., on December 10, 1975, a robbery occurred at the Freeway Sunoco Station in Kingsville Township, Ashtabula County, during which four men were shot.  Donald Cosner, station employee, John Buchtinec, station owner, and George Andrus, a customer, survived their resultant wounds.  However, John McQuiston, also a customer, died from a gunshot wound to the back of his head. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Carl Faulkner, and two others, Willie Jones and Preston Fayne, Jr., were indicted on January 8, 1976, for one count of aggravated murder in violation of R. C. 2903.01, with specifications as to this count under both R. C. 2929.04(A) (5) and 2929.04(A)(7); three counts of attempted aggravated murder in violation of R. C. 2923.02; and one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R. C. 2911.01.  Appellant entered a plea of not guilty to all charges and was separately tried before a jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony at trial included that given by each of the surviving victims and Preston Fayne, Jr., who stated that appellant was present during the robbery in question and had participated in the crimes alleged.  Appellant testified on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his own behalf and admitted that he had gone with Jones and Fayne to the gas station and committed a robbery, but denied that he had any involvement with a murder or attempted murders.  On May 5, 1976, the jury found appellant guilty as charged on all counts of the indictment.  Subsequently, a psychiatric evaluation of appellant, performed by Dr. Henry J. Lantner, was submitted to the trial court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mitigation hearing was held on July 14, 1976, at which no testimony was elicited and no statement was made by appellant.  Thereupon, appellant was sentenced to death by the trial court on the aggravated murder with specifications count, and to consecutive prison terms of 7 to 25 years on each of the remaining four counts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 28, 1977, the Court of Appeals affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences. </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2911.01, entered by the trial court upon a jury verdict and affirmed by the Court of Appeals for Ashtabula County (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, and aggravated robbery. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defense counsel's request to conduct a recross-examination of a witness. The prosecution's redirect inquired only about matters that were raised by defense counsel upon cross-examination. No new matters were explored in the prosecution's redirect examination. The court also held that the trial court did not err in making a brief restatement of facts not at issue within its charge to the jury, including defendant's judicial admissions of his intention to commit, and commission of, robbery. The court further held that the trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury on the issue of intoxication as a defense. The only evidence in that regard was that defendant's use of drugs and alcohol did not prevent him from remembering the events. The court sustained defendant's argument that the mitigating circumstances found in the Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2929.04(B) were unconstitutionally limited in scope.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 23, 1976, appellant, Charles D. Cotton, was indicted for, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aggravated murder with specifications.  The indictment specifically charged that appellant: (1) uttered, or possessed with intent to utter, a check of another which he knew to have been forged; (2) purposely and with prior calculation and design caused the death of another, with the specification that the offense was committed for the purpose of escaping apprehension for another offense, and with a second specification that the victim of the offense was a law enforcement officer while engaged in his duties; and (3) knowingly caused physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant entered a plea of not guilty to each count on March 10, 1976.  On April 29, 1976, appellant waived his right to a jury trial in open court and the court ordered that the trial be before a three-judge panel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence adduced at trial established that on February 6, 1976, appellant and his wife entered the T &amp; A Thrift Market to buy groceries.  Mrs. Cotton had in her possession a checkbook belonging to Thelma Miller and she removed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one of the checks and signed Thelma Miller's name to it.  The assistant manager previously had received a report that Thelma Miller's checkbook had been stolen and, when Mrs. Cotton presented the check in payment for the groceries, he called the police to ascertain the status of the check.  After waiting for a few moments, Mrs. Cotton presented a Master Charge card bearing Thelma Miller's name to pay for the groceries.  Appellant then took the grocery basket out to his car, unloaded it and returned to the store where his wife was waiting.  Two uniformed police officers, Michael R. Hutchison and Roger W. Casler, then entered the store.  Appellant ran from the store and both officers proceeded after him.  Officer Hutchison slipped and fell inside the store and Officer Casler caught up with appellant outside in the parking lot.  At this point, Officer Casler lost his footing, was hit by appellant and fell, striking his head on the concrete.  He was &quot;dazed&quot; by the fall.  After again catching appellant, Officer Casler did not draw his gun, but appellant took the gun from Officer Casler's holster.  During the scuffle, appellant was able to steady the weapon and fire.  The first shot hit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officer Hutchison in the arm and he said, &quot;I have been shot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scuffle between appellant and Officer Casler continued.  Both went down and Officer Casler remained down.  Two more shots were fired, one going into the back of Officer Casler.  It was stopped by a bullet-proof vest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then ran towards his car and came to Officer Hutchison, who had apparently been felled by his wound.  Appellant stopped, assumed a shooting position, held the gun with both hands and fired the fatal shot down into Officer Hutchison, who was apparently attempting to crawl.  Appellant then left the scene with both officers' guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and his wife, child and nephew were stopped in appellant's car not long after the episode had occurred.  The car was searched and the two police pistols were subsequently discovered: one in Mrs. Cotton's purse and the other in a diaper bag.  No other weapons were found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-judge panel unanimously found appellant guilty of all counts and specifications charged in the indictment.  Following a mitigation hearing, appellant was sentenced to death on the aggravated murder with specifications charge, to 2 to 5 years on the forgery charge and to 5 to 15&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years on the felonious assault charge, all to run consecutively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, 1977, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.  The cause came before this court as a matter of right.  <BR>State v. Cotton, 1977 Ohio App. LEXIS 9541 (Ohio Ct. App., Richland County, Oct. 26, 1977)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant was indicted for aggravated murder under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 after he shot and killed a police officer. At the close of evidence, defendant filed a motion for acquittal on grounds that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable mind could fairly conclude that defendant was guilty of aggravated murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's motion was overruled, defendant was convicted, and the lower appellate court affirmed. Defendant appealed further on grounds that there was no evidence of design or calculation and that one of the judges that heard the case, a probate judge, should have been disqualified from hearing a criminal case. On review, the court affirmed the conviction and held that the circumstances surrounding the firing of the non-fatal shots and the circumstances surrounding the firing of the last shot justified a finding of design which caused death of the officer. Finally, the court held that Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(A)(3) provided that a chief justice or acting chief justice could assign any judge of a court of common pleas or a division thereof temporarily to sit or hold court on any other court of common pleas or division thereof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 3:30 p.m. on May 19, 1975, Harry J. Franks, a money order collector for the U.S.N. Company, entered the Fairmont Cut Rate Store at Fairhill and Petrarca Roads in Cleveland, to collect funds for the money orders sold in the store.  When Franks left roughly 30 minutes later, closing the door behind him, a customer, a store employee and Mrs. Anna Robinson, the proprietor's wife, were in the store and two individuals armed with guns and subsequently identified as Ricky Jackson and the appellant, Ronnie P. Bridgeman, were standing outside the door near the entrance.  Franks carried a briefcase containing $429.12 and 460 money orders with a total face value of $138,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Franks left the store, Ronnie Bridgeman threw acid on his face, hit him with a club and tried to pull the briefcase from his hand.  When Bridgeman failed to get the briefcase, Jackson shot Franks twice.  He then shot Mrs. Robinson (who was by then looking out the window of the door and had seen someone bending over the victim's body) once in the neck.  Bridgeman and Jackson then fled carrying the briefcase. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franks died of the gunshot wounds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he suffered; Mrs. Robinson survived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 16, 1975, appellant was indicted on one count of aggravated robbery, one count of attempted aggravated murder and one count of aggravated murder, with the specifications (1) that the aggravated murder occurred while the appellant was committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery and (2) that the appellant purposely killed Harry Franks and purposely attempted to kill Anna Robinson.  On September 27, 1975, a jury found appellant guilty of aggravated murder committed while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery and of aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated murder.  Following a mitigation hearing, appellant was sentenced to death on the aggravated murder charge and to four to twenty-five years each on the second and third counts of the indictment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences of the trial court.  The cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant shot two people while attempting to steal cash and money orders. Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder committed while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, aggravated robbery, and attempted aggravated murder. The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(a) did not affect the common-law rule that a question was to be determined by the jury when reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to whether each material element of a crime was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the evidence against defendant was not so slight that reasonable minds must have had reasonable doubts as to defendant's guilt; two eyewitnesses saw defendant rob and shoot the two victims. Defendant's challenge to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B), the scheme for determining the existence of mitigating factors, was not considered because his death sentence had already been reduced to life imprisonment after &sect; 2929.04(B) was found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The appellate court decision affirming defendant's convictions and sentences was affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for acquittal because the evidence against him did not leave reasonable doubt in a reasonable mind. Defendant's challenge to the statutory scheme for determining mitigating factors was not considered because his sentence had already been reduced after the statute was found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mentor police arrested the defendant, Herschel Roberts, on January 7, 1975, and charged him with forging a check in the name of Bernard Isaacs, and with receiving stolen property, namely, a number of credit cards belonging to Bernard Isaacs and his wife, Amy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 10, the defendant came before the Mentor Municipal Court for preliminary hearing.  At the hearing, the defendant offered the testimony of Anita Isaacs, the daughter of Bernard Isaacs.  She testified that she had become friends with her classmate's younger sister, who was Roberts' girl friend, and that she had seen Roberts occasionally since June or July of 1974.  On December 23, 1974, she had given the key of her apartment to Roberts' girl friend, and had told her it would be all right if she and Roberts used the apartment while she was away for the next few days.  When she returned on December 30, Roberts said he was having trouble finding a place to stay, so she let Roberts go on using the apartment while she stayed at the home of a friend.  She never spent any time in her apartment with Roberts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having thus described her acquaintance with Roberts, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the witness denied ever having given him her parents' credit cards, and she denied ever having talked to him about giving him the credit cards to help him pay for a television.  Roberts' attorney did not ask to have the witness declared hostile, and he did not ask to examine her as on cross-examination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Municipal Court bound Roberts over to the grand jury which indicted him for receiving stolen property, R. C. 2913.51, and forgery, R. C. 2913.31.  The grand jury also returned a secret indictment against Roberts for receiving stolen property, namely, silverware and appliances belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Isaacs, and for possession of heroin, R. C. 3719.09.  The Court of Common Pleas of Lake County consolidated the proceedings on the two indictments and set the trial for July 17, 1975. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was continued six times, and the trial finally took place on March 4, 1976.  Between November 1975, and February 1976, the trial court issued five subpoenas for four different trial dates to Anita Isaacs at her parents' address.  It is undisputed that the last three subpoenas, showing returns on December 10, 1975, February 3, 1976, and February 25, 1976, respectively, all carried instructions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to &quot;please call before appearing.&quot; The witness never telephoned, nor did she appear at the trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, the prosecutor and the defense attorney both questioned Amy Isaacs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to determine whether Anita Isaacs was available to testify.  Mrs. Isaacs testified that at the end of January 1975, Anita had left home for Tucson.  She said that in April or May, she had received a form from a welfare office in San Francisco stating that Anita had applied for welfare.  Mrs. Isaacs had used the address on the form to locate the social worker who was dealing with Anita.  She had then talked to the social worker by telephone, and had spoken to Anita by telephone that same day.  Later in the summer, Anita had called her parents and had indicated that she was traveling somewhere outside Ohio.  From January 1975 to the date of the trial, neither Anita's parents nor any other relative had received any other communication from Anita. Mrs. Isaacs testified that she did not know what state Anita was in, and that she did not know how to contact Anita. </SPAN></P>

She could not be found for trial, and a transcript of her preliminary hearing testimony was admitted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.49. The court held that burden was on the State to show that the witness was unavailable by reason of her disappearance, and that the common pleas court erred in admitting the testimony. While the basic factual issues were the same at both proceedings, the ultimate factual issues were quite different. At trial, the ultimate issue was defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. At the preliminary hearing, in contrast, the ultimate issue was whether there was probable cause to believe that defendant had committed a crime. Since credibility was not the issue at a preliminary hearing as it was in trial, all the arts of cross-examination which were exerted to impair the credibility of a witness were useless in the preliminary hearing. Therefore, defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated by admission of the recorded testimony.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events giving rise to the instant cause began some time before June 1974, when Mr. and Mrs. Woodrow Ring, officers of Tri-City Geriatric &amp; Health Care Center, Inc. (appellee herein), decided, in part because of a dispute with their landlord as to rents and as to who should pay for improvements required by an adjudication order, to move their nursing home operation from quarters leased from the First Baptist Church of Massillon, to a building in Carroll County on which they had a purchase contract.  Mrs. Ring called the office of the State Department of Health to inquire about applying for a license for the new home on June 15, and on June 30 she submitted a license application.  At about that time she also discussed renovating the new facility with a representative of the Department of Industrial Relations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few weeks later Mrs. Ring moved nine patients into the unlicensed facility. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">1&nbsp;The procedure for licensing a nursing home is set forth in R.C. 3721.07 which provides: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Every person desiring to operate a home as defined in section 3721.01 of the Revised Code shall apply for such a license to the director of health.  The director shall issue a license for the home, if after investigation of the applicant and inspection of the home, the following requirements or conditions are satisfied or complied with: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(A) The applicant has not been convicted of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(B) The applicant is not violating any of the regulations made by the public health council or any order issued by the director of health; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(C) The buildings in which the home is housed have been approved by the department of industrial relations, and the state fire marshal or a township, municipal, or other legally constituted fire department approved by the marshal.  In the standards, and by the state fire marshal, and by section 3721.071 of the Revised Code[;] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(D) The applicant, if it be an individual, or the principal participants, if it be an association or a corporation, is or are suitable financially and morally to operate a home defined in section 3721.01 of the Revised Code; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(E) The applicant is equipped to furnish humane, kind, and adequate treatment and care; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(F) The home does not maintain or contain: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(1) Facilities for the performance of major surgical procedures; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(2) Facilities for providing therapeutic radiation; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(3) An emergency ward; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(4) A clinical laboratory unless it is under the supervision of a clinical pathologist who is a licensed physician in this state; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(5) Facilities for radiological examinations unless such examinations are performed only by a person licensed to practice medicine, surgery, or dentistry in this state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;(G) The home does not accept or treat outpatients except upon the written orders of a physician licensed in this state, maternity cases, boarding children, and does not house transient guests housed for twenty-four hours or less. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;When the director issues a license, the license shall remain in effect until revoked by the director or voided at the request of the applicant; provided, there shall be an annual renewal fee payable during the month of January of each calendar year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;Any applicant who is denied a license may appeal in accordance with sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From July to November 1974, Mrs. Ring increased the number of patients in the new home, made some repairs on the building and began plans for, but not the actual work on, the installation of a $ 27,000 sprinkler system for the new facility.  During that time, according to her testimony, Mrs. Ring was informed by a Mr. Donahue and a Mr. Sanders of the Department of Health that she was operating the home illegally. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also received two letters informing her that she was not to operate a nursing home in the new facility.  (On October 11, 1974, the Department of Industrial Relations sent a letter listing the improvements it would require &quot;before the building can be reopened as a nursing home and approved by this department.&quot; Approximately two weeks later the Department of Health wrote Mrs. Ring stating her application was being processed and notifying her that &quot;no more than two patients or residents may be admitted to your home until a license has been issued by the Director of Health.&quot;) <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">2&nbsp;Mrs. Ring testified that Mr. Donahue and Mr. Hoyt Sanders &quot;appeared on the scene and told me personally that I was operating illegally and that I should seek legal counsel and this is what I did.&quot; When asked by the court when this occurred, she testified that she didn't remember the exact date but that &quot;I was in the hospital ten days and I just got out a while.&quot; Earlier, Mrs. Ring testified that she was in the hospital for ten days at roughly the same time that the welfare patients were moved from the Massillon facility and the patients who remained with her were moved to the new home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After November 1974, Mrs. Ring began to install the sprinkler system and to continue with other renovations.  In February 1975, without having either granted or denied the home a license and, according to the testimony of one of the investigators, some time long after such licenses are usually acted upon, the Director of Health, appellant herein, filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Carroll County to enjoin, pursuant to R.C. 3721.08, the operation of the Tri-City home.  (Approximately ten months later the Department of Industrial Relations issued a final adjudication order against the home which appellee has appealed pursuant to R.C. 3781.031.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the hearing on appellant's motion to enjoin the operation of the home, the parties stipulated that the Tri-City facility was unlicensed and that it was operated as a nursing home within the meaning of R.C. 3721.01.  Ruling that the maxim that &quot;he who seeks equity must do equity&quot; applies to the instant cause, the trial court denied the injunction, directed appellee to make further changes in the home and ordered appellant to issue a license.  The Court of Appeals for Carroll County ruled that &quot;where a statute creates a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  new statutory right of action, equitable principles may not be applicable&quot; but affirmed the trial court's denial of the injunction on the grounds that R.C. 3721.07 (the statute setting forth the requirement that nursing homes be licensed) was unconstitutionally applied in the instant cause.  The appellate court also substituted the common pleas court's order with an order to appellant to either grant or deny appellee's license application within ten days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to an allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant director of health sought review of an order from the Court of Appeals for Carroll County (Ohio), which denied the director's application for an injunction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3721.08 that would have prevented appellee from operating its nursing home facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The nursing home moved its facility into a different building and applied for a license at the new address. Before any new license was issued the director notified the nursing home that it was operating illegally. The director applied for an injunction but the injunction was denied. On review the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3721.08 granted a trial court jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to enjoin the illegal or dangerous operation of a nursing home if the home is operated without a license or if there was a real and present danger to the health or safety of any occupants of the home. The court held that it was not necessary to show both a danger and unlicensed operation. The court found that it was established state law that when a statute granted a specific injunctive remedy to an individual or to the state, the party requesting the injunction did not need to aver and show that great or irreparable injury was about to be done for which he had no adequate remedy at law. The court noted that where an injunction was authorized by a statute and designed to provide a governmental agent with the means to enforce public policy, no balancing of equities was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and held that the statute should have been granted because the statutory conditions existed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator-appellee, Ohio State Bar Association, filed a complaint with the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of Ohio pursuant to Rule VI of the Supreme Court Rules for the Government of the Bar of Ohio, seeking the retirement, removal or suspension from office of respondent-appellant, Judge James J. Mayer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first two paragraphs of the complaint state: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1.  Relator alleges that cause exists to remove Respondent from the office of Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio for the reason Respondent engaged in * * * conduct * * * prejudicial to the administration of justice and for the reason that Respondent engaged in * * * conduct * * * which would bring the judicial office which he holds into disrepute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.  Relator alleges that cause exists to remove Respondent from the office of Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio for the reason that Respondent is suffering from a physical disability and from a mental disability * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After investigation in compliance with Gov. R. VI and R. C. 2701.11, the board reported to the Supreme Court its finding that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;* * * there is substantial credible evidence in support of the misconduct allegations as set forth in paragraph one of the complaint * * *.&quot; Thereafter, the Supreme Court, pursuant to Gov. R. VI and R. C. 2701.11 appointed a five-judge commission to determine the question of retirement, removal or suspension of appellant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission of judges conducted a hearing in the matter and ordered that appellant &quot;* * * be retired for disability as a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio with the right to any emoluments, benefits and compensation allowed by law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant appealed the order of the commission to this court and moved for a stay of the order of the commission pending disposition of the appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The State Bar alleged that cause existed to remove the judge from his office because the judge engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and engaged in conduct which would bring the judicial office into disrepute. The State Bar further alleged that cause existed to remove the judge because the judge was suffering from a physical disability and from a mental disability. The Commission ordered that that the judge be retired for disability. The judge argued that the Commission's order was not supported because evidence showed that the judge did not suffer from any present disability which now prevents his performance of his job. In affirming the Commission's order, the court held that given the judge's physical condition, there was ever-present a latent possibility of recurrence of the mental conditions that precipitated his non-judicious conduct. The judge suffered from manic depressive disorder. Evidence showed that the judge engaged in conduct violative of the Code of Judicial Conduct when his lithium level was not properly maintained, which was an ever-present possibility due to the drug's complication of the judge's intestinal cancer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, 1977, respondent, Judge Paul E.

Walter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).  Respondent ruled that certain statutes concerning the distribution of &quot;basic state aid&quot; to public schools were unconstitutional and therefore void.  Respondent provided that the effect of the order was to be suspended until July 1, 1978, at which time the statutes in question would become inoperative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That judgment has been appealed and is pending in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.  Oral argument has not yet been scheduled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator herein, Franklin B. Walter, Superintendent of Public Instruction, is a defendant-appellant in the above cause.

Walter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filed with the Court of Common Pleas an application for stay pending termination of appellate litigation.  On May 1, 1978, plaintiffs in that case filed a motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to extend time and for an evidentiary hearing on the stay application.  Respondent granted plaintiffs' motion and scheduled May 26, 1978, as the date for the evidentiary hearing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants-appellants then filed a motion for reconsideration, on which oral argument was heard on May 16, 1978.  Respondent indicated his intention to proceed with the evidentiary hearing as scheduled.  At the May 16 hearing, plaintiffs indicated their intention to depose relator Walter and three other non-party witnesses, who are also relators herein (Oliver Ocasek, President Pro Tempore of the Ohio Senate; Vernal G. Riffe, Jr., Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives; and Richard Sheridan, Ohio Legislative Budget Officer).  These depositions were scheduled for May 18, 19, 22 and 23, 1978, and respondent ordered that a convenient place was the office of plaintiffs' counsel in Cincinnati. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators filed with this court on May 17, 1978, complaints in prohibition and motions for alternative writs to prevent respondent from holding an evidentiary hearing on defendants-appellants' application for stay pending termination of appellate litigation in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Board </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lonnie Black (appellant) was arrested on July 25, 1975, and indicted on August 13, 1975, for the attempted aggravated murder and the aggravated robbery of Dr. Margaret Tucker (decedent).  The original two-count indictment was nolled, and the appellant was indicted for aggravated robbery and for aggravated murder with the specification that the offense was committed while the offender was committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 12:30 and 1:00 a. m. on the morning of July 8, 1975, a security guard observed the decedent leaving the Veterans Administration Hospital, where she had been employed for the last ten years.  The guard testified that he recalled that the decedent was carrying a shopping bag, but he did not know its contents nor did he observe a purse in the decedent's possession.  Within approximately ten or fifteen minutes after he had observed the decedent leaving the hospital, apparently for her apartment in the vicinity, the security guard heard what he believed to be three gunshots in rapid succession. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1:38 a. m., on July 8, 1975, while patrolling the East Boulevard area, a Cleveland&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police officer discovered the decedent, with her head lying in a pool of blood, in front of the Western Reserve Historical Society.  Subsequent searches of this area failed to reveal any of the decedent's personal effects, including the shopping bag.  Meanwhile, the decedent was transported to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where an examination revealed two gunshot wounds.  There was an entrance wound on the posterior part of the right shoulder and a corresponding exit wound on the anterior part of the right shoulder.  The other bullet entered the decedent's chin, fractured the jaw, deflected downwards, fractured the hyoid bone, transected the spinal cord and lodged in the neck, leaving the decedent paralyzed.  The decedent died on October 29, 1975, as a result of bronchopneumonia caused by the gunshot wound to the face. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to testimony elicited at trial, the appellant had a conversation with Barbara Hickman, age 21, and her sister, Beverly, age 15.  During this conversation, according to the testimony of the Hickman sisters, the appellant told them that he had to leave town because he had just shot a white woman in the face near the Veterans Administration Hospital when she refused&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to give up her purse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant's stepfather, Richard Harrison, testified that he took the appellant to the bus station on July 8, 1975, at 11:00 p. m., and that appellant bought a ticket to Tennessee.  The appellant was eventually arrested in Springfield, Tennessee, and brought back to Cleveland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant testified on his own behalf at the trial.  He stated that the trip to Tennessee had been planned for several weeks, and he went there with the expectation of seeking employment.  Appellant admitted to having a conversation with the Hickman sisters but denied making any inculpatory statement and denied his involvement in the murder of the deceased.  The defendant also relied upon the alibi that he was visiting with one Adolphus Cureton, a security guard at Parkgate Beverage, at the time of the murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty of aggravated murder with the specification and of aggravated robbery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter and in accordance with R. C. 2929.03, a sentencing hearing was held.  The trial judge, failing to find any mitigating circumstances established by a preponderance of the evidence, imposed the required death penalty for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the aggravated murder charge and a term of years on the aggravated robbery charge.  Appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which affirmed his criminal convictions and sentence. Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder with specifications and aggravated robbery. The death penalty was imposed after the trial court failed to find any mitigating circumstances established by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">A murder victim was seen leaving work carrying a shopping bag. A security guard heard gun shots and the victim was found shot a short distance away, lying in a pool of blood, without any of her personal possessions. During his trial two witnesses testified that defendant had confessed that he had to leave town because he had shot a woman near the victim's place of employment. Defendant appealed and asserted that the State had failed to prove his intent to commit murder, that his confession should not have been admitted into evidence, and that the sentencing hearing was flawed. In affirming the convictions, the court held that the State had to independently prove the corpus delicti in order to admit defendant's extra judicial confession. The record contained evidence of both the criminal act and the criminal agency and defendant's confession was, therefore, properly admitted. The use of a gun was sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to kill. The court reversed the sentence imposed. Defendant did not have the burden of proving the existence of mitigating factors and it was error for the trial court to place that burden on him during the mitigation hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, reversed the death penalty imposed, and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1970 and 1973, appellant, American Modulars Corporation (now merged with United States Steel Corp.), purchased tangible personal property from out-of-state and Ohio vendors for use in two counties which levied, pursuant to R. C. 5739.021 and 5741.021, one-half percent sales and use taxes.  The Ohio purchases were made in counties which did not levy those taxes.  On July 17, 1974, the Tax Commissioner of Ohio assessed a one-half percent use tax on appellant's use of the property purchased out of state.  Appellant was not assessed the one-half percent sales and use taxes on property purchased in the state.  Appellant appealed the Tax Commissioner's assessment to the Board of Tax Appeals on Ohio and federal constitutional grounds.  The board determined that it was without jurisdiction to address the constitutional argument and affirmed the order of the commissioner. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant taxpayer challenged the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which determined that it was without jurisdiction to address a constitutional argument and affirmed the order of appellee tax commissioner who assessed a one-half percent use tax on the taxpayer's use of property purchased out of state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The issue was whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5741.021, as a permissive local use tax incorporating the exceptions of a mandatory state use tax, violated the Commerce Clause. The question was whether that tax burdened interstate commerce by discriminating against the acquisition of goods when those goods were acquired out of state. The court reversed. The court found that because goods used in taxing counties and purchased in non-taxing Ohio counties were not subject to a four and one-half percent tax even though identically used goods purchased out of state were so taxed, &sect; 5741.021 provided a direct commercial advantage to local purchases which impeded the free flow of trade between the states. The court held that &sect; 5741.021 was unconstitutional insofar as its application imposed a higher tax rate on property purchased out of state and used in a taxing county than on similarly used property purchased in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Licking County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William V. Nabozny (appellant) was arrested for the killing of James Jeffrey Crawford (decedent).  The Licking County grand jury returned an indictment on January 30, 1976, charging the appellant with aggravated murder in violation of R. C. 2903.01 and the specification that the murder was committed while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping in violation of R. C. 2929.04(A)(7). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decedent was employed by the National Bank of Detroit as an assistant branch bank manager.  On the morning of December 5, 1975, the decedent was abducted from the parking lot of the branch bank where he worked.  According to the testimony of two eyewitnesses, two adult males apparently forced the decedent into a dark automobile (described by one witness as a Monte Carlo) and then drove away from the bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal state's witness was Chester Wysocki.  Testifying under a grant of immunity from the state of Ohio, Wysocki revealed that he had participated with John Garside and William Nabozny (appellant) in an aborted attempt to kidnap the decedent on December&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4, 1975.  Wysocki also testified that, pursuant to a telephone call from Garside on December 5, 1975, he went to the Detroit suburban home of Joseph Byle, a mutual acquaintance.  Upon his arrival at the Byle residence, Wysocki met the appellant and Garside and saw Crawford, who was bound and blindfolded in the basement.  Garside, fearful that the Monte Carlo had been recognized during the commission of the crime, instructed Wysocki to rent another car.  Enlisting the aid of David Finley, Wysocki rented an orange Firebird and returned to the Byle residence.  Later in the afternoon, the appellant, Garside and the decedent left in the Firebird for Garside's rented house in Eden Township in Licking County, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wysocki remained in Michigan and undertook to extort $ 250,000 from the National Bank of Detroit through a series of telephone conversations with bank personnel.  Failing to effectuate an exchange, and believing a news report that the ransom would not be delivered without proof that the decedent was still alive, Wysocki drove to the rented house in Ohio to tape record the decedent's voice.  The recording having been made on the morning of December 8, Wysocki returned to Detroit, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  leaving the appellant and Garside with the decedent at the rented house.  This tape recording was discovered later that same day by the decedent's sister, acting upon instructions received by phone from Wysocki. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 9, 1975, Garside returned to Detroit in the orange Firebird to meet with Wysocki to devise a plan for receiving the $ 250,000.  On that afternoon, Garside and Wysocki believed they were being followed and decided to meet later that day at the residence of Joseph Holmes.  At approximately 5:45 p. m., Wysocki testified that, while they were at this house, Garside made a series of telephone calls, including at least one to Ohio, and that he heard Garside giving directions &quot;[t]o clean up the house.&quot; Borrowing the station wagon owned by Holmes, Garside departed, while Wysocki remained in Michigan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decedent's time of death was placed at 10:30 p. m., on December 9, by the Licking County coroner.  This was substantiated by a pathologist connected with the Hamilton County coroner's office.  The pathologist testified that the decedent had lived for an hour or two after the stabbing because no major arteries were severed by any of the 30 stab and incised wounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the evening of December 9, Sharon Scheurell, apparently Garside's common-law wife, appeared at her sister's home in Columbus seeking lodging for herself and &quot;Skip&quot; (a nickname by which appellant is known).  Being denied lodging, Scheurell went to the home of her mother, Mrs. Emma Evans.  The identity of the person who accompanied her was not disclosed during the prosecution's case.  Later, as indicated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) surveillance of the Evans' home, the station wagon owned by Joseph Holmes and driven by a male arrived at the house at 2:15 a. m.  The automobile departed the Evans' house at 2:35 a. m. and arrived at Garside's rented house at 4:04 a. m.  The appellant was identified as a passenger in the auto after it left the Evans' residence and Garside was identified with the automobile upon its arrival in Eden Township. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that morning, the appellant, Garside, Scheurell and her children left the house and met Homer Porter at a truck stop at the intersection of State Route 37 and Interstate 70, east of Columbus.  They then returned to Columbus.  Leaving her children in Columbus, Scheurell accompanied the appellant and Garside on a journey in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the station wagon along Interstate 70 that terminated with the arrest of the appellant and Garside by the FBI outside Dayton, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, Scheurell was released and returned to Columbus.  However, within a short time of her release Mrs. Evans contacted the FBI and they returned to her home.  A search of the Eden Township area for the decedent's body subsequently ensued but was discontinued with the approach of night.  The search was renewed the following morning, when the decedent's body was discovered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state was able to corroborate the testimony of Wysocki concerning the presence of Garside, the appellant, and the decedent at Byle's home by the testimony of Joseph Byle.  Byle testified that Garside, the appellant and an unidentified male arrived at his house at approximately 9:00 a. m. on December 5.  He then stated that he left his house to go hunting, and, upon his return, the house was vacant.  Additionally, David Finley testified as to the assistance he rendered to Wysocki in obtaining the orange Firebird.  Furthermore, a search of Garside's house in Eden Township revealed the fingerprints of the decedent, appellant, Garside and Scheurell. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on his own behalf at the trial.  He admitted being in Columbus on December 9 and meeting Scheurell but alleged his purpose was to engage in illicit drug traffic.  Appellant also admitted to being at the house in Eden Township on the 10th but stated he was there only to help clean the house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found the appellant guilty of aggravated murder with a specification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter and in accordance with R.C. 2929.03, a sentencing hearing was held.  The trial judge, not finding any mitigating circumstances, imposed the required death penalty.  Appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. </SPAN></P>

The trial judge, not finding any mitigating circumstances, imposed the death penalty. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, defendant claimed, among many items, that since the state failed to prove the identity of the actual person who purposely committed the killing, he could not be convicted. The court affirmed the conviction, noting, inter alia, that the threshold inquiry was not whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the actual killer, but whether, once testimony of the conspiracy to kidnap was offered, was there proof beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the conspirators killed the victim during the kidnapping. There was sufficient evidence of such a conclusive and persuasive force for the jury to determine on the facts that there was no reasonable hypothesis other than guilty and accordingly to decide that either defendant or one of the co-conspirators purposely murdered the deceased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The Division prohibited the use of the company's conveyor units, for which the company never secured an installation permit.

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment and certified the case to the court as the judgment was in conflict with another decision from a different appellate court.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of May 11, 1975, Suzanne L. Candler's body was found in a wooded area at the Galbraith Road exit off Interstate 75 in Cincinnati.  Her clothing was in disarray.  There was evidence of recent sexual intercourse and there were .38 caliber gunshot wounds in her body.  Her car, a Ford Maverick, was parked along the expressway.  The evidence showed that Suzanne, age 19, had been enroute from Cincinnati to visit her family in Lima.  It was Mother's Day and Suzanne left at about 5:30 a. m., as she planned to attend church that morning with her family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on information derived from their investigation of the apparent homicide, on May 12, 1975, the Cincinnati police obtained a warrant to search the premises at the residence of the defendant, James T. Curtis.  The search warrant included defendant's car as an item to be seized, together with a .38 caliber revolver, and certain personal effects of the deceased.  At about 5:00 p. m. on that day, defendant was arrested as a suspect in the homicide.  Pursuant to the warrant, the police searched defendant's home and found the victim's purse.  They also recovered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a .38 caliber revolver from the trunk of defendant's car, which was parked in the driveway at his residence.  Ballistic tests revealed that defendant's gun fired the bullets which killed Suzanne Candler.  At the police station, the victim's ring and watch, as well as four spent .38 caliber casings, were discovered when defendant emptied his pockets.  All of these items were introduced in evidence at defendant's trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony at trial established that between 3:30 to 3:45 a. m. on the morning of the homicide the defendant was observed by police officers in the area where the deceased's car was parked.  Another witness, Miss Patricia G. Chitwood, testified that she was driving south on Interstate 75 in the area of the homicide at about 4:15 to 4:30 a. m. on that morning, and at that time was closely followed for about 10 miles by the defendant, who was driving a vehicle resembling a police cruiser but which had no emblem.  She testified that defendant stopped her by means of a red flashing light and represented that he was a police officer.  He took her driver's license and suggested that she accompany him to his car, which she did.  After remaining in the car for some time, she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  apparently became suspicious, grabbed her license, returned to her car, and drove away.  She promptly reported the incident to the police.  On or about May 12, 1975, Miss Chitwood appeared at the police station where she identified defendant as the person who had stopped her vehicle on the morning of the murder.  No motion to suppress her identification was made, nor was there any objection to the identification at trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed a notice of alibi prior to trial and presented the testimony of an alibi witness, Glenn Sullivan, that he and the defendant had been drinking at various bars on the night in question; the witness stated that he was with the defendant until about 4:00 a.m. The defendant testified that he had been a private security officer.  He denied any knowledge of the incident and claimed that he had the deceased's personal effects because the deceased and he were having an affair.  He stated that she had given him the ring, that he had her watch to get it repaired and that he discovered that she had left her purse in his car.  There was no corroboration of the latter's testimony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of aggravated murder with specifications, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  finding that the murder was committed during the perpetration of an aggravated robbery and rape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the trial court, at a mitigation hearing, found that no mitigating circumstances were established and sentenced the defendant to death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conviction of defendant was appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the trial court.  An appeal as of right has been taken to this court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress the evidence of a revolver found in the trunk of defendant's automobile. The court affirmed the court of appeals' decision. The court stated that the car was properly seized as an item of evidence pursuant to a valid search warrant. Thus, the car was lawfully in the custody of the police to be used as evidence in the subsequent trial. The court found, in response to defendant's contention that the Ohio scheme for imposing the death penalty was unconstitutional, that sufficient standards were provided to comply with constitutional mandates against cruel and unusual punishments. Defendant's final contention was that the trial court erred in that its finding of no mitigating circumstances was based on cursory psychiatric examinations. The court found that, although there was a conflict of medical opinion, there was ample evidence to find that defendant was not psychotic or mentally deficient so as to entitle the trial court to conclude that none of the mitigating circumstances had been established by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases were tried to the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County during several days in September 1976, and January 1977.  On January 18, 1977, the trial court entered an oral opinion, finding that appellees were entitled to appropriate the easements which they sought.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The landowners' argued that the legislature could not limit the power or the right of appellate courts to review judgments of the courts of common pleas, and that any such legislative attempt was unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed the decision. The court found that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.03, every final order, judgment, or court decree could be reviewed, unless otherwise provided by law. The court found that the legislature had otherwise provided by law in stating that a trial court's order in favor of the appropriating agency on the preliminary questions was not immediately appealable. The statutory scheme contemplated that the landowners could obtain appellate review only after the preliminary issues were decided by the trial court, a jury assessed compensation, and a journal entry was made. Only after a judgment was entered were all the rights of the parties adjudicated. There was no inherent right of appeal from a judgment of a court, and such right could only be conferred by constitution or statute. Because the legislature had the constitutional authority to make such a decision, the landowners' argument was rejected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During 1972, each of the appellants -- Scott &amp; Fetzer Company; Cook United, Inc.; Heinen's, Inc.; and the Coca-Cola Bottling Corporation -- filed corporate franchise tax reports and paid franchise taxes on income earned in 1971.  They used the net income method of calculating franchise tax liability provided for in R. C. 5733.05.

Within 90 days of the announcement of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Lakengren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision, each of the appellants filed for a refund of the difference between what it paid in franchise taxes in 1972 under the R. C. 5733.05 net income measure of liability and what it would have paid under the net worth measure of liability that had been in effect prior to the enactment of R. C. 5733.05.  The Tax Commissioner dismissed the claims for the requested refunds on the grounds that, because appellants had not claimed them within three years after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  paying their corporate franchise tax, he did not have jurisdiction pursuant to R. C. 5733.12 to grant them.  Appellants appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case the board declined, on jurisdictional grounds, to decide the constitutional issues raised by appellants.  It also held that R.

The Commissioner dismissed their refund claims and the Board affirmed. The court affirmed the Board. The language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.12 was clear. The taxpayer had three years after payment, and 90 days after ascertainment that a payment was illegal, in which to request a refund. Further, the three-year deadline was absolute. Section 5733.12 was not retroactive as applied to the taxpayers because, while it decreased their refund filing period, it did not destroy an accrued right or change the legal significance of, or place new obligations upon, their past conduct.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instant controversy originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.  The following matters were agreed to before that court by the parties: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant is the duly qualified and appointed Director of the Department of Natural Resources of the state of Ohio, and appellee is a chartered municipal corporation organized and existing under the Constitution and laws of this state; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to R. C. Chapter 1501, appellant may designate any watercourse in this state to be a wild, scenic, or recreational river area, which in appellant's judgment possesses water conservation, scenic, fish, wildlife, historic, or outdoor recreational values which ought to be preserved.  Appellant has determined that Big Darby Creek is to be designated a Scenic River Area from a point near a covered bridge on Old State Route 38 in Madison County, southward for approximately fifty-three and eight-tenths miles along said watercourse to its confluence with the Scioto River.  The above-referenced portion of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Big Darby Creek qualifies as a Scenic River Area pursuant to R. C. 1501.16.  Appellant has manifested his intent to designate this portion of Big Darby Creek a Scenic River Area and has so notified appellee; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee provides its inhabitants with water supply facilities and services, and in so doing operates a public utility.  Appellee has instituted a program for the construction, operation and maintenance of a new water supply reservoir to be located on Big Darby Creek within the area proposed by appellant for designation as a Scenic River Area.  Appellee has appropriated portions of the necessary funds for this water supply program and has expended certain of these funds in acquisition of land and in feasibility studies in furtherance of the program; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of the water supply reservoir will cause a modification of the channel of Big Darby Creek and will result in the erection of structures on the Big Darby Creek within the proposed Scenic River Area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the facts stipulated, it is undisputed that the instant controversy originally was instituted because appellant, on or about February 6, 1974, notified appellee's mayor of appellant's intent to journalize&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the determination that the Big Darby Creek meets the criteria for designation as a scenic river pursuant to the provisions of R. C. Chapter 1501.  The area is outside appellee's present corporate boundaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas declared R. C. 1501.17 violative of the Constitution of Ohio.  Upon appeal by the Director to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Under &sect; 1501.17, the department declared a stream to be a Scenic River Area that was protected from development. At the same time, the city was attempting to build a water supply reservoir along the stream in an area outside its municipal boundaries. The trial court declared &sect; 1501.17 violative of the Ohio Constitution. The appeals court affirmed. On further appeal, the court held that the authority enjoyed by municipalities under Ohio Const. art. XVIII could not be extinguished by the general assembly. Nevertheless, under appropriate facts, the power possessed by the general assembly under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 36 could override the interest of a city in constructing water supply impoundments located outside its corporate limits. Courts were to determine the facts in such controversies, balance the rights of the state against those of the municipality, and endeavor to protect the respective interests of each. Whether the law was constitutional as applied would be determined by the facts and circumstances of the case. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1501.17 was not facially violative of Ohio Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene L. Adams, appellant herein, was indicted in Franklin County for aggravated robbery and aggravated murder in a two-count indictment.  The first count of the indictment charged appellant and one Thomas D. Deal with violating R. C. 2911.01, in attempting or committing a theft offense as defined in R. C. 2913.01 while having a deadly weapon on or about their persons or under their control.  The second count charged appellant and Deal with purposely causing the death of Marlyn J. Darst while committing, attempting to commit, fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, with a specification under R. C. 2929.04(A)(7), in compliance with R. C. 2941.14, that the offense was committed while the offenders were committing, attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing aggravated robbery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At appellant's trial, the evidence established that Marlyn J. Darst, while working at a carry-out store, was shot twice and died as a result of those wounds.  There was evidence that money had been taken from the cash register of the store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rena Darst, the ten-year old daughter of the deceased, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that on the night of the crime, having heard &quot;something like a bang,&quot; she entered the store which her mother had been tending, and saw her mother lying on the floor kicking at a man with a gun, who was wearing a stocking pulled over his head.  She saw him shoot her mother twice.  Rena failed to identify the appellant at trial, but there was other testimony that the appellant had changed the style and color of his hair since the date of the crime.  She did pick his photograph from a group of six pictures shown to her by a policeman a few days after the crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, she identified a certain jacket as the one worn by the man with the gun.  Two other witnesses testified that that same jacket was the one the appellant was wearing on the night of the crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three witnesses saw the assailant get into a waiting car, and all three descriptions of the car agree.  David A. West testified that on the day before the crime he rode to Lake Erie in a car that matched the eyewitness descriptions, with his uncle Tommy Deal, with the appellant, and with Margaret Etter, who is now Deal's wife.  (Deal is charged in the same indictment with the defendant, and the state maintains that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he drove the get-away car.) Having spent the night at the lake, West and the others returned to Columbus in the evening of the next day.  West testified that after they reached Columbus, the appellant &quot;said something about hitting a place on High Street.&quot; The store where the deceased was killed is on South High Street in Columbus.  Deal and the appellant then left West and Margaret Etter at the home of West's sister and departed again.  West testified that the two men returned shortly, and that he heard the appellant admit that he had shot a woman three times.  Margaret Etter testified that the appellant was pale and nervous when he returned to the house with Deal, and that when she asked, &quot;Why did you shoot the woman,&quot; he answered that it was because she had kicked him.  West's sister also testified that she heard the appellant admit to shooting a woman.  Later the same night, Margaret Etter, West and Deal took the appellant to Cincinnati.  Etter testified that during the ride she again asked why the appellant had shot the woman, and that he repeated that it was because the woman had kicked him, and that he had said there had been a child present at the time. </SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery and aggravated murder. The jury convicted defendant only on the murder charge, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. Defendant sought review. The court found that the capital punishment statutes were not unconstitutional, that defendant lacked standing to seek suppression of the gun on the ground it was obtained without a warrant because defendant was not present when the gun was seized, that the conviction of just the murder charge was not an inconsistent verdict, that there was no error in the trial court's replacement of two jurors, and that it was harmless error for evidence of defendant's prior conviction to be admitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 29, 1975, a robbery occurred at the Austin Beverage Store in the Austin Village Plaza in Trumbull County.  During the occurrence, both of the employees then present, Dominic Chiarella and Frederick C. Piersol, were shot by one of the two robbers.  Chiarella died of his bullet wounds, and Piersol was seriously wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that evening, police officers, acting upon information concerning the robbery suspects received from a service station attendant, stopped an automobile bearing the license plate number furnished by the attendant.  A search of the occupants, Pompie Junior Wade (appellant) and Moses Hurd, and the automobile revealed 13 or 14 .32 caliber bullets. a shotgun in plain view on the back seat, a .32 caliber revolver, a ski mask (all of which were identified at the trial as being similar to the items used in the robbery), and sundry food items of the brands carried by the Austin Beverage Store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, appellant was indicted by the Trumbull County grand jury for the crimes of aggravated murder with specifications, attempted aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 3, 1976, a suppression&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing was held and resulted in a finding by the trial court that appellant's admission to the robbery and shooting of the two employees of the Austin Beverage Store was voluntarily given and therefore admissible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial was commenced, and, on March 17, 1976, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts charged in the indictment.  The trial court, failing to find any mitigating circumstances, sentenced appellant to death on the aggravated murder conviction, in accordance with the statutory mandate, and to two consecutive sentences of from seven to twenty-five years on the other two convictions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's motion for a new trial being overruled, he appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed his conviction. </SPAN></P>

After his motion to suppress was denied, defendant was convicted. In affirming, the court determined that prospective jurors should not have been asked about their views on capital punishment on a questionnaire. However, defendant failed to make a timely challenge to the array, pursuant to Ohio. R. Crim. P. 24(E). In addition, certain remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument were not inflammatory, nor did they prejudice defendant's rights. The court held that certain comments made by the judge were not prejudicial to defendant's rights. Further, defendant failed to make an objection during the trial. In the instances where defendant did object, he failed to show that there was any possibility of prejudice arising from those occasions. Finally, defendant failed to file his motion to suppress in the time mandated by Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(C).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karen Miller (decedent) was employed by a photographic processing company, called Foto Fair.  On the evening of October 24, 1974, the decedent telephoned her mother and asked her to come to the Foto Fair booth to accompany her home.  The decedent had been frightened by a dark-haired man who had been there that evening.  Mrs. Miller went to the booth, and she and her daughter left for home at approximately 8:30 p. m.  Upon their arrival, the decedent was hailed by a voice from the street.  Inquiring as to the identity and receiving a reply ending in &quot;y&quot; or &quot;ie,&quot; according to Mrs. Miller, the decedent proceeded to the street, and Mrs. Miller entered the house.  Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Miller noticed a car in the street and signaled to the decedent to come in.  Mrs. Miller next heard a door slam and, looking out again, saw the car was gone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbors of the Millers, walking home, heard the car door slam and then saw a car traveling in their direction at a high speed without its headlights turned on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After unsuccessfully attempting to locate the decedent, Mrs. Miller reported to the police, at approximately 10:00 p. m., &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that her daughter was missing.  Shortly thereafter, the decedent's body was found on a bridge on Kemp Road in Beavercreek Township, Greene County, with a bullet hole through the head and neck and exhibiting evidence suggestive of a sexual assault. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent to his confession to the Greene County sheriff's department, on January 3, 1975, the grand jury returned an indictment of aggravated murder with specifications, charging Kenneth Ray Barker (appellant) with purposely causing the death of Karen Miller &quot;while committing kidnapping or rape or while fleeing immediately after committing kidnapping or rape.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, after the rejection of his motion for a change of venue and motion for suppression of evidence, was brought to trial by a jury on March 31, 1975.  On May 8, 1975, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of aggravated murder with all three specifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter and in accordance with R. C. 2929.03, a sentencing hearing was held.  The trial judge, not finding any mitigating circumstances, imposed the required death penalty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's motion for a new trial was considered and overruled at a hearing held on August 7, 1975. </SPAN></P>

The court also held that (1) the record had no indication that the consent to the taking of a hair sample was involuntary; (2) the showing of only one photograph to the identifying witness was not impermissibly suggestive; (3) the reversal of one specification was not reversible error; (4) the doctor's testimony that bruises in the vaginal area of the victim indicated force was not erroneously admitted; (5) the testimony of the State's rebuttal witness was not improper; (6) the admission of an altered exhibit, the victim's brassiere, was not an abuse of discretion; (7) defendant's claim that due to drugs he was unable to form the purpose to murder was raised for the first time on appeal and was correctly disregarded; and (8) the death penalty did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bill of indictment was filed against appellant, Donnie Long, charging him with aggravated murder.  Appellant's trial to a jury commenced on February 24, 1976. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the evidence was that during or around the last two weeks of August, 1975, Terence C. Butler had been attacked by appellant and that in the course of their brawl appellant said to a bystander, &quot;Give me a pistol because I'm going to kill this nigger.&quot; Butler testified that on the day that decedent, Jeffrie C. Boyd, was killed, Butler and Boyd went to a crap game at a pool hall and appellant was there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Butler stated that when he saw appellant walk through a door, Butler and Boyd attempted to depart.  Appellant pulled a gun from his pocket, aimed at Butler and began firing.  Boyd and Butler dived through a doorway, at which point Boyd fell to the floor, blood pouring from his head.  Appellant left the scene, having fired approximately six shots in a span of four seconds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Butler admitted that at one juncture he had threatened appellant's life, owned numerous guns and at one time before Boyd's killing had stalked appellant with a shotgun.  Appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that the killing occurred while he was defending himself.  His evidence of self-defense was his own testimony that he had not seen either Butler or Boyd in the pool hall on the day of the killing until the incident at issue.  He testified that Butler and Boyd stepped to opposite sides of the room, the latter attempting to hide a bottle behind his back.  According to appellant, Butler and Boyd then closed in upon him and Boyd raised the bottle when he was two feet away.  Appellant stated that Butler reached for his pocket and that appellant then drew his own gun, intending to fire into the air.  Appellant testified that when he fled the pool hall, he feared pursuit by Butler and Boyd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, testimony was taken from officer Ronald A. Perella, of the Akron Police Department.  Officer Perella testified that he had arrived at the scene of the Boyd shooting to protect it, to prevent persons inside the pool hall from leaving and to keep persons outside the pool room from entering; he testified that he saw no loose bottles lying on the floor in the area where people had been about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 3, 1976, appellant was found not guilty of aggravated murder, but guilty of the lesser&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  included offense of murder.  On March 16, he was sentenced to serve an indeterminate sentence of 15 years to life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 22, 1976, the Court of Appeals for Summit County affirmed appellant's conviction, and the cause is now before us pursuant to our allowance of appellant's motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The supreme court held the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant bore the burden of proving the affirmative defense of self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, this being in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A). However, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 30, a party could not assign as error the giving or the failure to give instructions unless he objected thereto before the jury retired to consider its verdict. Defendant conceded that he failed to object to the giving of the erroneous instruction. Further, a jury instruction violative of &sect; 2901.05(A) did not constitute a plain error or defect under Ohio R. Crim. P. 52(B) unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. The record in the instant cause did not meet this criterion. The court held the trial court did not deny defendant his right to cross-examine a state witness concerning the witness's interest and bias. The record showed that defense counsel was afforded an aggressive cross-examination of this witness and was able to impeach his credibility despite the limitation on cross-examination. Thus, any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Licking County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 24, 1975, Donald Steven Toth, appellant herein, was indicted by the Licking County Grand Jury for the crime of aggravated murder, with the specification that he &quot;* * * did unlawfully and purposely and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of Terri Singleton * * *,&quot; in violation of R. C. 2903.01(A).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant plead not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges in the indictment.  Following a sanity hearing, the court found, on July 21, 1975, that Toth was sane and competent to be tried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of June 4, 1975, Patricia J. Zinck, age 19, Terri L. Singleton, age 20, and Kathy Roseculp, age 20, decided to visit the Toy Box Bar, located in Union Township, Licking County, Ohio.  They arrived there around 10:00 p. m.  Upon entering the bar, Patricia left the group to go to the restroom, and upon rejoining her friends, saw the appellant sitting at the bar next to Terri.  The girls left the bar around 10:30 p. m. because the appellant was bothering Terri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girls then set out by car to the Rock Palace, located about one mile away from the Toy Box Bar, only to again encounter the appellant. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Kathy and Patricia were standing near the juke box, the defendant was seen approaching Terri, who continued to ignore him.  The girls thereupon left the Rock Palace and returned to the Toy Box Bar.  They arrived there around 1:00 a. m. on the morning of June 5, 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, shortly before 1:00 a. m. that same morning, Orin G. Noyes saw the appellant trying to repair his car on the corner of the parking lot next to the Rock Palace and the main road.  Noyes, in assisting the appellant, found that the car's headlights were connected to the wrong terminals, and repaired them.  Noyes heard the appellant say that he would &quot;waste&quot; those responsible for &quot;messing&quot; with his headlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant then returned to the Toy Box Bar and began to argue with the three girls concerning his headlights.  Patricia denied that the girls did anything to his car, and asked that the appellant leave them alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, the appellant reached into his pants and pulled out a gun.  The gun fell to the floor.  The appellant picked up the gun, fired and missed.  He then grabbed Patricia by the hair, held the gun to her jaw, and fired.  Taking two more steps he shot Terri, and from two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to four more steps shot Kathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terri Singleton later died in a Columbus hospital on June 9, 1975.  Doctor George A. Gressle, the coroner for Licking County, testified at the trial that Terri died of a pulmonary embolism directly caused by the gunshot wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Jean Toth, one of the two witnesses for the defense, who was apparently the common-law wife of the appellant, testified on direct examination that she had been in the company of the defendant on the afternoon of June 4, 1975.  She stated that, despite the fact that the appellant had drunk about a fifth of Bacardi rum (less two shots) that afternoon, he was not drunk when he left their trailer home around 10:00 p. m. that night.  She stated, however, that upon his return home between the hours of 1:00 and 1:30 a. m. the next morning, the defendant was &quot;* * * staggering all over the place, falling over furniture * * * mumbling and not making any sense * * *.&quot; She stated that when the appellant entered the trailer he told her not to ask any questions, that he did not want to hurt her, and that he wanted to park his car somewhere away from the trailer.  He also had a gun and loaded it.  According to Mrs. Toth, the appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  then undressed himself and went to bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon cross-examination of Mrs. Toth, it was learned that the Toth trailer was located about 8 or 9 miles from the Toy Box Bar (a one-way trip took 25 minutes to complete over five separate routes); that upon the defendant's returning home early on the morning of June 5, 1975, he stated to her that if anyone asked about him, she should reply that she had not seen him for two weeks; that, before retiring for the night, the defendant placed a gun under his pillow; and that, about a week and a half before the crime, the defendant had hit her on the face during an argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following medical opinions were rendered concerning the issue of whether the appellant was insane at the time of the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctor Allen Sherrow, a psychiatrist, called as a witness for the defense, testified in answer to a hypothetical question, that in his opinion, the appellant was temporarily insane at the time of the crime, which condition was induced by a combination of drugs and alcohol.  He testified further in response to this question, that at the time of the crime, the appellant was severely impaired in terms of judgment, that he had major problems&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in terms of thinking, and in terms of being able to negotiate, that in his condition he was extremely paranoid and suspicious, that he was unconscious to the extent that his judgment would be severely clouded, and that he suffered a black out, in terms of remembering as opposed to functioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Doctor Dwight D. Palmer, the court-appointed psychiatrist, testified that at the time of the crime the appellant was sane, and testified further in answer to a similar hypothetical question as given to Doctor Sherrow, that in his opinion, at the time of the crime, the appellant was not blacked out, that he knew what he was doing, and that he suffered from a personality disorder of the anti-social type.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following, additional evidence was provided the jury on the issue of whether the appellant was intoxicated at the time of the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orin G. Noyes testified that while assisting the appellant with his headlights minutes before the appellant returned to the Toy Box Bar, he noticed that the appellant was logical in his speech, and not staggering or &quot;falling all over himself.&quot; Noyes noted that the appellant was angry about his headlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven H. Eichorn, the owner of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Toy Box Bar, testified that the appellant ordered a drink when he was in the bar around 4:30 p. m. on June 4, 1975, that he remained there about 45 minutes, and that upon his return to the bar early in the morning of June 5, 1975, he showed no signs of intoxication, such as a staggered walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alfred C. Mazalic, who witnessed both the altercation between the girls and the appellant, and the ensuing shots of fire, observed that the appellant demonstrated no physical difficulties either in his speech or walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Gerald Eddington testified that upon apprehending the appellant at home around 4:08 a. m. on June 5, 1975, he observed that there was no odor of alcohol whatsoever about the appellant's person, that his speech was clear, and that his ability to walk was very good.  Sergeant John Swick also observed that at 5:00 a. m. the appellant spoke very plainly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial before a twelve-member jury commenced on August 21, 1975.  In its instructions to the jury, the court, in effect, directed that the appellant had the burden of proving the defense of insanity and of establishing his claim of disabling intoxication by a preponderance of the evidence.  On August 27, 1975, the jury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rendered a guilty verdict as to the charge and specification made in the indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mitgation hearing was conducted on November 17, 1975, whereupon the court found that the appellant failed to establish any of the mitigating factors set forth in R. C. 2929.04 by a preponderance of the evidence, and imposed the sentence of death upon the appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court granted appellant a hearing on his motion for new trial, and found that the jury verdict as rendered on August 27, 1975, was sustained by sufficient evidence and not contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">In an appeal as a matter of right, defendant sought reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Licking County (Ohio), which affirmed both his conviction for aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(A) and the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant suspected three young women of tampering with the headlights on his automobile. Stating that he would waste the person responsible for messing with his car, he entered a bar where he shot all three women, one of whom later died. On appeal of his death sentence he argued that the trial judge improperly instructed the jury on the defense of insanity, that the murder was not aggravated because it was not committed with prior calculation and design, and that he was improperly required to prove a statutory mitigating factor at sentencing in order to avoid the death penalty. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the error in instructing the jury on insanity was not prejudicial where all the witnesses who observed defendant before, during, or after the crime, except his common law wife, testified that he showed no signs of intoxication or drug influence. There was sufficient substantial evidence in the method of shooting the three women and the statement about wasting someone to prove that defendant acted with prior calculation. The sentence of death was reversed, however, because it was error to impose the burden of proving a mitigating factor on defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court affirming defendant's conviction for aggravated murder. The sentence of death was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instant cause arises out of the nonrenewal of appellant Chris Depas' contract as principal for the Sharon Elementary School, Medina County, Ohio.  In the spring of 1974, Depas signed a one-year limited contract with appellee, the Board of Education of the Highland Local School District, to serve as principal for the Sharon Elementary School.  When Depas' contract came up for renewal in the spring of 1975, the board unanimously voted not to reemploy him as a principal.  The board did, however, employ Depas as a classroom teacher for the 1975-1976 school year.  Depas received written notice of the board's decision not to renew his limited contract as a principal prior to April 30, 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depas then filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Medina County challenging the board's decision.  The board's subsequent motion for summary judgment and affidavits from both parties were referred by the trial court to a referee.  The court accepted the referee's recommendation and granted the board's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depas appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals upon the following assignments of error:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court erred in accepting the referee's recommendation and in entering summary judgment for the appellee Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;II. The trial court erred in concluding that appellee's nonrenewal of appellant's teaching contract without adhering to its duly adopted employment policies did not unconstitutionally deprive appellant of continued employment with the appellee board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals found that the assignments of error &quot;overlapped,&quot; considered them together and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the requirements of procedural due process applied only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and property. While one of those property interests was an interest in continued employment, an employee must have had a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment. In the absence of statutory or contractual guarantees of continued employment, one claiming a protected property interest had to produce rules or mutually explicit understandings that supported his claim of entitlement to the benefit. The court found that the employee had not shown that he was entitled to continued employment by the school board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an original action in which the Attorney General seeks to have this court order respondent Judge Harold H. Galbraith to enforce R. C. 2743.70.  The cause is before this court upon an agreed statement of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator alleges that respondent, as the Judge of the Vandalia Municipal Court, has a mandatory legal duty under R. C. 2743.70 to impose the sum of three dollars as costs (in addition to any other court costs he is required by law to impose) in all cases in which a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to any offense other than a traffic offense that is not a moving violation, but that respondent has refused to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator also alleges that respondent Patricia Dresser, as the Clerk of the Vandalia Municipal Court, has a mandatory legal duty under R. C. 2743.70 to transmit these same costs to the Treasurer of State, but that she has refused to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1976, Judge Galbraith declared R.

The court's &quot;entry&quot; shows that case to have been a routine traffic offense, in which the court sustained an oral defense motion not to impose&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the three dollars in court costs for the reason that H. B. No. 82 (the Victims of Crime Act, effective September 29, 1976, which includes R. C. 2743.70) was unconstitutional, without specifying the reasons for such decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants are firemen employed by the city of Westlake, appellee herein.  Prior to November 1, 1972, appellants accumulated one and one-fourth &quot;days&quot; (each day equalling 8 hours) per month of sick leave.  If a fireman missed work for a &quot;day&quot; (which involved a 24 hour shift), he used only one &quot;day&quot; (8 hours) of sick leave.  However, in 1972, the appellee converted all unused sick leave of the appellants from a daily basis to an hourly basis, to be retroactively applied from November 1, 1969.  The appellee, in effect, reduced all unused sick leave earned by the appellants after November 1, 1969, by two-thirds.  Furthermore, from and after November 1, 1969, appellants were charged with 24 hours of their accumulated sick leave if they were absent from a normal day's work due to illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellants filed a declaratory judgment action in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, claiming, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the city acted without authority in reducing previously accumulated and unused sick leave earned by the firemen and in improperly interfering with appellants' vested rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motions for summary judgment were subsequently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed by both parties.  In their motion, appellants contended, in part, that the city deprived them of a vested right contrary to Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and that, under R. C. 124.38 and Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, the city had no authority to restrict the right of its employees to accumulate unused sick leave benefits.  The appellants did not serve the Attorney General with a copy of their declaratory judgment action as required by R. C. 2721.12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ruling on the motions, the trial court held that although the appellants were entitled to reinstatement of their unused sick leave benefits as they existed prior to November 1, 1969, the appellee could constitutionally place a limit on the accumulation of those benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal by both parties, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeals, holding that the trial court's judgment was void and of no effect, since the appellants failed to serve a copy of the declaratory judgment proceeding upon the Attorney General as required by R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The lower court dismissed a declaratory judgment action brought by appellant employees against appellee city challenging the constitutionality of a city ordinance, based on the fact that appellants failed to serve a copy of the declaratory judgment proceeding upon the Attorney General as required by Ohio Rev.

R. 4, which did not require special service upon the Attorney General, superseded the special service requirement of &sect; 2721.12. Upon review, the court affirmed. It noted that by employing the verb &quot;shall&quot; throughout &sect; 2721.12, the General Assembly manifested a clear intent that the statute's provisions, including service upon the Attorney General, were mandatory. Accordingly, in such a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance, declaratory relief was precluded where the Attorney General was not served a copy of the proceeding as required under the statute at issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the prosecution presented 32 witnesses to prove the defendant's guilt, most of the evidence consisted of testimony by Virginia Browning, a girl friend of the defendant, and by Mr. Ronald Byers, a friend of the defendant.  Their testimony established that the defendant, Charles Edward Downs, was well acquainted with the three victims.  Bailey and Hodgman had rented a small house in a very remote area of southern Fairfield County.  The defendant, Byers and Browning had often visited the Bailey residence.  Apparently, Bailey and the defendant were dealers in marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately two months prior to the date of the homicides, the defendant had given Bailey some money to buy marijuana.  Bailey apparently cheated the defendant out of his money.  Angry about the loss, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendant suspected Bailey of duplicity.  He made several statements to other people that if &quot;* * * he found out for sure Bailey had taken his money, he [would] kill him * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the date of the crime, August 9, 1975, the defendant was living in Lancaster, Ohio, with Virginia Browning.  Ronald Byers visited the defendant on the morning of August 9, 1975, to borrow some money.  The defendant indicated that he had no money to loan.  He requested Byers to drive the defendant into the country to check on some marijuana patches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 11:00 a. m. on August 9, Byers drove the defendant and Browning to a remote part in southern Fairfield County to check on the marijuana patches.  The defendant discovered that someone had taken his marijuana plants.  He was very angry.  In the presence of Browning and Byers, he accused Bailey of taking the plants.  He then said that he was going to kill Bailey, Bailey's girl friend and her child.  The three then drove back to the defendant's apartment in Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After having eaten lunch, the defendant removed a shotgun and a box of shotgun shells from his bedroom.  Mr. Thomas O'Roarke, a friend visiting the defendant at this time, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  saw the defendant, Byers and Browning, leave in Byers' car around noon on August 9, 1975.  O'Roarke did not know what the defendant planned to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning testified that while driving to the Bailey residence, the defendant and Byers talked about various ways the defendant could stealthily approach the homestead.  It was decided that they would go around by a back road which would allow the defendant to approach the Bailey home from the rear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the defendant got out of the automobile he removed all articles of personal possession from his pockets except his handkerchief, so that he would not drop any incriminating evidence.  The defendant took a knife from the car.  Defendant told Byers to pick him up in two hours.  The defendant warned Browning not to tell anyone about his intentions or he would kill her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Byers drove Browning back to the defendant's apartment.  After picking up his wife and dropping her off at a friend's residence, he then returned to meet the defendant at the aforementioned rendezvous.  Upon arriving at the car, the defendant had blood on his pants and shoes.  The knife was also covered with blood.  The defendant then told Byers that he had shot Bailey, Connie&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hodgman and the little girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While driving back to the defendant's apartment, the defendant threw some spent shotgun shells out of the car window.  Two of those shells were later found and matched with two other shells found at the scene of the crime.  When the two men arrived at the residence, the defendant took the shotgun and shells into the apartment.  Byers then left to pick up his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the defendant entered the apartment, Browning and O'Roarke were waiting.  After O'Roarke left the apartment, the defendant told Browning that he had killed Bailey and Connie and Tracy Hodgman.  The defendant indicated that he was going to get rid of the gun by burying it.  Prior to leaving his apartment, he burned the shotgun shell box in the shower.  The defendant then left with the gun.  The gun was never found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that same night, August 9, 1975, Browning, the defendant and Byers all went to another friend's apartment for a party.  According to Byers' testimony, the defendant remarked that he had disposed of the gun, but had forgotten to get rid of the knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, the defendant went to his sister's residence for a Sunday afternoon dinner.  The defendant showed the knife&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to one of his brothers.  Accompanied by his brother, the defendant then went to a cemetery behind his sister's residence.  After wiping the knife with a handkerchief, he threw both the knife and the knife case into the cemetery.  Only the knife case was later recovered.  Byers identified the case as the one he had given to the defendant on the day of the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday afternoon, August 11, 1975, Browning's mother told the sheriff's office about the killings.  The defendant was arrested and indicted on three counts of aggravated murder, with the specification in each count that the killings were a part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons.  R. C. 2929.04(A) (5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, ballistics experts matched the two shotgun shells which were found along the road at a place indicated by Byers with the shells which were found near the bodies of Bailey and Connie Hodgman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state introduced evidence to prove that the defendant had owned a 16 gauge shotgun and that the shotgun had been in the defendant's possession when he had left the apartment just prior to the commission of the three murders.  The state also established that previous troubles&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had existed between Bailey and the defendant and that the defendant had threatened to kill Bailey, Connie and Tracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered no defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found the defendant guilty of all counts of the indictment.  Following a mitigation hearing, the court sentenced the defendant to death.  The Court of Appeals affirmed both the conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Following a mitigation hearing, defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant claimed that the capital sentencing procedure violated constitutional due process because it required an offender to prove certain mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence in order to be sentenced to life imprisonment, rather than to death. The court held that although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(E) placed the burden of the risk of non-persuasion during the mitigation hearing upon the offender, it did not impose an unconstitutional burden. The court also held that the trial court had properly appointed a psychiatrist to make a presentence report and was not constitutionally required to appoint an additional psychiatrist of defendant's choosing at state expense. The court further held that the police officer's failure to return the search warrant to the properly designated judge and to prepare an inventory did not render inadmissible the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause concerns the involvement of the defendant, James Kenneth Weind, in the abduction and murder of Hermalee Ross on December 15, 1974. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"><SUP>*</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weind was charged with the following counts: (1) kidnapping ( R. C. 2905.01); (2) aggravated murder ( R. C. 2903.01[A]), in that he purposely and with prior calculation and design, caused the death of Hermalee Ross; and (3) aggravated murder ( R.

Included in counts two and three were the specifications that the murder was committed during a kidnapping ( R. C. 2929.04[A][7]) and for hire ( R. C. 2929.04[A][2]).<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">*&nbsp;This court has already affirmed the judgments and sentences of appellant's co-defendants, Mrs. Alberta Osborne, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Osborne</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> (1976), 49 Ohio St. 2d 135, and Carl Osborne, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Osborne</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> (1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 211.</SPAN></P>

The court on June 20, 1975, having found none of the mitigating factors listed in R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of kidnapping and two counts of aggravated murder. Included were specifications that the murder was committed during a kidnapping and for hire. Finding no mitigating factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04 to have been established by a preponderance of the evidence, the trial court's sentence included the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Among other assertions, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's death penalty, the finding of insufficient mitigating factors, the failure to have defendant reexamined by psychiatrists to establish a mental deficiency or psychosis, the denial of a continuance, discovery misconduct, and the calling of a witness by the trial court. The court upheld the convictions and sentences. Ohio's scheme for establishing mitigating factors, including judicial sentencing, was approved in decisional law. Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(3), which allowed a trial court to dismiss specifications if defendant pled guilty to a charge, was constitutional and did not have chilling effect on the right to plead not guilty. The record supported the trial court's determination that defendant was not acting under duress, coercion, or strong provocation. The possibility of a psychosis was not enough to support a finding of a mitigating circumstance. The denial of a continuance was unavailing in the absence of a showing of prejudice. There was no abuse of discretion shown in the trial court's handling of discovery irregularities. The practice of a trial court calling a witness was lawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 22, 1976, the Board of County Commissioners of Cuyahoga County (board) adopted two resolutions, a &quot;Purchase and Lease Resolution&quot; and a &quot;Bond Resolution.&quot; The Purchase and Lease Resolution provides that Cuyahoga County (county) will acquire the existing facilities of Deaconess Hospital of Cleveland (hospital).  The resolution authorizes the improvement of the facilities and a leaseback of those facilities to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bond Resolution authorizes the issuance of $ 26 million of Cuyahoga County hospital-improvement first-mortgage revenue bonds to finance the acquisition and improvement of the hospital facilities.  This resolution provides for the pledge of, and a lien on the hospital receipts for payment of, the bonds, and authorizes an indenture of mortgage providing for the payment of the debt service charges on the bonds and for securing such payments.  Upon retirement of the bonds, the hospital may purchase the facilities at a nominal cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Purchase and Lease Resolution also provides that approximately $ 10.6 million of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds will be used to retire and release the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  existing first mortgage on the hospital property so that a new first mortgage can be placed on such property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board concluded in the Purchase and Lease Resolution that the acquisition and improvement of the hospital and the leasing of the facilities would better provide for the health and welfare of the residents of the county by enhancing the availability, efficiency and economy of hospital facilities.  Thus, the objectives of the resolution would promote the public purposes stated in R. C. 140.02.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receipt of the resolutions, the Cuyahoga County Auditor, appellant herein, advised the board by letter that, although he did not question that the county might properly issue hospital revenue bonds under R. C. Chapter 140 to provide approximately $ 16 million for the proposed construction and remodeling of existing facilities or that the county could use revenue bond proceeds to purchase existing hospital facilities, he did specifically question the use of the $ 10.6 million, to retire the existing debt of the hospital, as a proper public purpose.  The auditor then refused to perform the duties specified in the resolutions, to draw drafts or warrants pursuant to R. C. 319.16, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  321.12 and 321.15, or to certify the availability of funds in accordance with R. C. 5705.41(D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 21, 1976, the board and the hospital, appellees herein, initiated an action in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, seeking to have the auditor directed to perform the necessary actions to permit the issuance of the hospital revenue bonds and apply the proceeds from the sale of such bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant in his answer to the complaint maintains that because the issuance of the bonds would not promote a public purpose, as required by R. C. 140.02, he has no duty to perform pursuant to the resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 28, 1977, the Court of Appeals allowed the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon appeal by the auditor as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

The court reasoned the determination of whether a use of bonds constituted a public purpose was primarily the function of the board, as the bond issuing authority, and was subject to being overruled only if manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a statement given by appellant to Cincinnati police (tape recorded and entered into evidence at trial below), appellant Jerry Jackson and Curtis Palmore, at approximately 7:45 p. m. on November 14, 1974, approached the service station where Charles Pomerantz was working.  Appellant and Palmore intended to rob the attendant at the station.  While appellant deliberately diverted the attention of Pomerantz from Palmore, to facilitate the robbery, Palmore shot Pomerantz.  Palmore then removed Pomerantz's wallet from his pocket, and when the two left the scene they took the wallet and the service station money box with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palmore's father testified that on November 18, 1974, he found a library card and a driver's license, both bearing the name of Charles Pomerantz, among his son's personal effects.  He turned the items over to Cincinnati police officers, and testified at trial that on the evening of November 14, 1974, appellant and Palmore had conversed in the latter's house, and that the two had departed the house together before 8:00 p. m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cincinnati detective Frank Sefton testified that appellant's statement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of November 19, 1974, was taken while appellant was in custody, and that Sefton already had told appellant that the police had two witnesses to the Pomerantz crime who could identify a suspect.  Sefton testified that he already had played appellant a recording in which Curtis Palmore named appellant as Pomerantz's killer.  Sefton also had told appellant that Curtis had named appellant as the party who had taken the service station cash box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 6, 1974, the Hamilton County Grand Jury returned a two count indictment, with a specification as to the first count, jointly charging appellant and Palmore with aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.  Appellant waived his right to trial by jury and a three judge panel found him guilty as charged.  On September 11, 1975, the panel unanimously found that none of the mitigating circumstances in R. C. 2929.04(B) had been established by a preponderance of the evidence, and sentenced him to a term of from seven to twenty-five years for his aggravated robbery offense, and to death for his aggravated murder offense.  On December 13, 1976, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court as a matter of right, pursuant to Section 2(B)2(a)(ii) of Article IV of the Constitution of Ohio.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant, along with a codefendant, was accused of robbing and killing a service station attendant. He argued that a statement he made while in custody should have been suppressed because officers played him a recording in which the codefendant had implicated him, informed him that two witnesses could identify him, and showed him evidence identifying him as a suspect, thereby making his statement involuntary. The court rejected the argument. It stated that defendant had been properly advised of his constitutional rights and that his confession was voluntarily initiated by defendant himself. Next, the court held that because there was evidence from which the trial court could have found defendant's confession to be voluntary, the fact that the State did not call as a witness each officer who participated in defendant's interrogation was not a basis for reversal under the &quot;missing witness&quot; rule. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that his death sentence was arbitrary because defendant's offer to plead guilty to the murder charge in exchange for the imposition of a life sentence was not accepted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1973, Patricia Hall (appellee) filed a complaint on behalf of herself and Lisa Renee Ross, her minor child, alleging that John J. Rosen (appellant) is the father of Lisa Renee, and seeking future support and reimbursement for necessaries furnished the child in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee claims that she met appellant in 1968 and they began to associate almost daily.  At this time, appellee was single, being previously divorced from Jerry G. Ross.  Appellant contends further that she and appellant engaged in sexual relationships in Chicago during July of 1968, resulting in the conception of Lisa Renee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 6, 1969, appellee married her former husband, Jerry G. Ross, who was fully aware of her obvious pregnancy.  Lisa Renee was born on May 6, 1969.  The birth certificate bears Ross' name as the father.  Appellant does, however, admit to sending funds to cover the hospitalization cost, as well as sending intermittent payments for support, and to visiting appellee and her child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, Ross filed for a divorce.  The decree granting the divorce was entered on May 20, 1970.  The decree determined, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the child born during the marriage was &quot;not issue of the marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court granted appellant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that, as a matter of law, appellant was entitled to the judgment.  Appellee filed a motion for reconsideration.  Relying on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Anderson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1885), 43 Ohio St. 473, the trial court overruled the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas and remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of appellant's motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant biological father challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which reversed existing precedent and held that the father was liable to appellee mother for the support of the child born during the mother's marriage to another man. The issue before the court was whether the rule that the husband was solely responsible for the support of any child born during the marriage would continue to be the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The mother became pregnant by the biological father but before the birth re-married her ex-husband; all parties knew that the husband was not the father of the child. A year later the husband and the mother divorced and the divorce decree declared that the child was &quot;not the issue of the marriage.&quot; When the mother sought support from the biological father, the trial court granted the father's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that binding precedent declared that when the husband married the mother knowing that she was pregnant by another, the husband became the only party liable for the child's future support even after a divorce. The intermediate appellate court reversed, holding that the historical precedent was out-of-date and needed to be set aside. The court on review rejected the appellate court's reasoning, reaffirmed the trial court's holding, and emphatically reinstated the established rule of law that decreed the husband in marrying the mother while pregnant with another man's child had &quot;adopted&quot; the child and by promissory estoppel, stare decisis, and for social policy reasons had become solely liable for the child's support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court, reaffirmed the ruling of the trial court, and held that the mother of the child could not bring a child support action against the biological father of the child but could only proceed against her former husband for the child's support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 20, 1973, the Department of Insurance (appellee) rejected the applications of Earl Shipper, Gerald T. Phillips and Associated Adjusters of Ohio, Inc., to become certified public insurance adjusters in Ohio.  Subsequently, the applicants filed with appellee their requests for adjudication hearings, as provided by R. C. 119.06 and 119.07.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consolidated hearing of the three cases was held on August 13, 1973, at which time the hearing officer received briefs from the applicants and from appellee.  Over the objection of the applicants, the hearing officer permitted five certified Ohio public insurance adjusters, Morris I. Atkin, John A. Donovan, Robert Sill, James Triplett and Arthur F. Westfall, to intervene and file a brief opposing the certification of the applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 27, 1974, the hearing officer announced his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations.  With regard to the individual applicants, the hearing officer found that neither Shipper nor Phillips was an Ohio resident.  He therefore recommended that the individual applicants be denied certificates of authority to act as public insurance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adjusters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the corporate applicant (hereinafter Associated Adjusters), the hearing officer found that although Associated Adjusters was duly incorporated in Ohio, the individual applicants, Shipper and Phillips, were its only officers and directors, and that the corporate stock was owned entirely by nonresidents.  The hearing officer therefore concluded that Associated Adjusters was not a resident of Ohio, and recommended that it be denied a certificate of authority to act as a public insurance adjuster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After review of all the evidence, the Superintendent of Insurance concurred with the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the hearing officer.  All three applicants then filed notices of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, pursuant to R. C. 119.12.  The Court of Common Pleas consolidated the appeals, and on August 1, 1975, rendered a decision overruling all assignments of error proposed by the applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 22, 1975, Associated Adjusters filed its notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.  No such notice of appeal was filed in the case of the individual applicants.  The Court of Appeals, on July 29, 1976, rendered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its decision, affirming the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas as to Associated Adjusters.</SPAN></P>

He further concluded that while appellant was duly incorporated in Ohio, the individual applicants were its only officers and directors and that the corporate stock was owned entirely by nonresidents. He recommended that it be denied a certificate as well. The superintendent of insurance concurred. The applicants appealed, but the court overruled all proposed assignments of error. Appellant alone challenged the court's order, but the intermediate court affirmed. The appellate court also affirmed. It held that the individual applicants had attempted to circumvent the statutory residency requirement by incorporating their enterprise in Ohio and, therefore, the court disregarded appellant's fictitious corporate entity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The car owner left his stalled car in a lane of traffic on a dark, wet night and departed for a gas station. The driver collided with the rear of the car owner's car and was injured. On appeal, the court found that the car owner's conduct was more than simple negligence. The court determined that with full knowledge of the surrounding circumstances, his reckless and inexcusable disregard of the rights of other motorists would support a finding of wanton misconduct. The court held that should a jury determine that the car owner's behavior and the surrounding circumstances were as described at trial, a finding of wanton misconduct would be appropriate. The court concluded that where the driver of an automobile failed to exercise any care whatsoever toward those to whom he owed a duty of care and his failure occurred under circumstances in which there was great probability that harm would result, such failure constituted wanton misconduct. The court held that the driver's contributory negligence did not bar recovery where it was determined that the damages suffered as a proximate result of the car owner's wanton misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 4, 1974, plaintiffs, an organization composed of non-teaching employees of the Board of Education of the Cleveland City School District, and a civil service employee, filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, injunction and equitable relief, and a motion for preliminary injunction, in the Court of Common Pleas.  In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that R.

Section 124.271 allowed provisional civil service employees in certain circumstances to become permanent employees without taking a competitive examination. Section 124.271 allegedly violated Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 10. On review, the court found that because school districts were not mentioned in &sect; 10, its limitations on the power of the General Assembly to enact laws relating to a &quot;appointment and promotions in the civil service&quot; were not applicable to appointments and promotions in the civil service of the city school districts. The General Assembly had the power to enact civil service laws applicable to schools by reason of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7, to encourage schools and the means of instruction. Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 10 did not apply to laws relating to civil service appointments and promotions in city school districts. Therefore, Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 15, 1975, Sidney Cohen was shot and killed in his pawn shop, located in downtown Akron.  On January 21, 1975, appellant, Sandra Lockett, was indicted by the Summit County grand jury in connection with the Cohen homicide.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 28, 1975, Georgene Burse was found dead in her place of business, the Borocki &amp; Burse Florist Shop, located at 1280 Lockwood Road, Coventry Township, Summit County.  Mrs. Burse had been shot six times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that day defendant-appellant, Stacey Lane, informed several relatives that he planned to rob the florist shop.  Earlier, Lane had questioned Richard L. Sturm, a half-brother who had formerly been employed at the florist shop, concerning how many people would be there and how much money would be available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant went to the shop twice.  The first time he did not carry out his plan because other people were present.  On the second occasion, just prior to 5:30 p. m., appellant and Sturm drove up to the florist shop.  Lane announced his intention to perpetrate the robbery, and then proceeded into the shop.  As Sturm got out of the car he heard Mrs. Burse scream.  At this point Sturm apparently became frightened and began to flee the area.  As he ran, he first heard one shot come from the florist shop; he then heard five more shots in succession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that evening, appellant was observed counting money taken&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the decedent and looking through several credit cards belonging to her.  Another half-brother, Rudy P. Trivonovich, asked appellant what had happened.  Lane disclosed that, after entering the florist shop and confronting the victim with a gun, she threatened to call the police and turned to walk away.  Appellant spun her around and hit her, and then shot her four times in the head, once in the throat and once in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 9, 1975, appellant was indicted and arraigned on charges of aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, and two specifications thereto as follows: (1) The murder was committed to escape detection, apprehension, trial or punishment; and (2) the murder was committed while appellant was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after the commission or attempted commission of, an aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial was commenced before a jury on July 21, 1975.  At that time the state presented its two key witnesses, Sturm and Trivonovich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The trial court prohibited the questioning of veniremen on their views regarding capital punishment on voir dire because it felt that the charge would be that the jury would not take into consideration any question of punishment in reference to Ohio Rev.

On appeal, defendant argued that by restricting voir dire examination on the question of capital punishment, the trial court prevented a venireman's possible partiality to emerge and be met by challenges for cause or peremptory challenges. He alleged that because there may have been members of the jury who were not opposed to the death penalty, those individuals may have been unable to fairly determine guilt. The court disagreed and held that the trial court delivered a preliminary instruction to the veniremen, to the effect that they would consider only the issue of guilt, and further informed them that they would not prescribe the sentence should a guilty verdict be returned. The court determined that no evidence was presented which supported defendant's contention that the possible presence on the jury of one not opposed to capital punishment prevented a fair and impartial determination of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 15, 1974, the deceased, Hermalee Ross, was abducted by two men from the parking lot of an Ontario food store in Franklin County, and was later found dead with bullet wounds to the back of her head and neck, and to her ear and hand, and with numerous other abrasions and contusions apparently caused by repeated strikings with a blunt instrument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robbery was ruled out as the motive since the victim was still wearing her watch and a ring when her body was discovered, and the victim's purse, containing a $ 100 bill, was recovered from two young girls who had found it on the Ontario parking lot.  The victim's automobile was also recovered on the Ontario lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of the police investigation, it was discovered that the victim's husband, Edgel Ross, and defendant-appellant, Alberta Osborne had been involved in an affair of long standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 30, 1974, Alberta L. Osborne was indicted on three counts by the Franklin County Grand Jury.  The first count charged kidnapping in violation of R. C. 2905.01; the second count charged aggravated murder in violation of R. C. 2903.01(A), with two specifications of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aggravating circumstances, that the homicide was for hire, pursuant to R. C. 2929.04(A)(2), and that the murder was in the course of a kidnapping, pursuant to R. C. 2929.04(A)(7); and the third count charged aggravated murder in violation of 2903.01(B), murder committed in the course of a kidnapping, with the same specifications as listed in the second count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state alleged that Carl Edward Osborne, Jr. (appellant's son), James Kenneth Weind, Carl's friend, and appellant, while acting in concert, kidnapped and murdered Hermalee Ross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant entered a plea of not guilty to all three counts of the indictment and was separately tried by a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant filed a pretrial motion asserting that exhaustive news media coverage of this homicide had attracted intense public interest and that detailed news reports of the results of the police investigation had saturated Franklin County and made it unlikely that a jury could be impaneled which would be able to fairly try the defendant free of the influence of that publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant asserts that such influence was aggravated by the fact that the subpoenas served upon prospective jurors in her case contained her name, and argues that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one must assume that persons thus notified would avidly read all the pretrial newspaper accounts of the matter and thus be particularly aware of evidence and speculation contained therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court reserved its ruling until after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was conducted and then overruled the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At appellant's trial, Delaware County deputies testified that they received a call from Mrs. Dorothy Hale who lived about 150 yards from an abandoned schoolhouse in that jurisdiction.  She reported that she had observed two males pull up to the school in a blue-green automobile; that they removed a female, and took her inside; and that a few moments later, the two men left the schoolhouse without the female.  The deputies then proceeded to that location and found the deceased's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Lois Berg, who was in a laundromat near the Ontario store at the time of the abduction, testified that she observed a tall, light-skinned black, wearing jeans and a patterned bandana around his head, in the Ontario lot that morning.  She testified further that a &quot;commotion&quot; with another person took place, and that a blue-green car with two occupants left the lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos of appellant's family cars were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shown to Lois Berg and to Mrs. Hale and to her son, who had partially observed the incident.  All identified the photo of a blue-green 1969 Plymouth automobile as being the one they had previously seen.  It was later shown that the identified automobile belonged to Kay L. Osborne, appellant's daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bullets retrieved from the victim's body and from the scene of the murder were determined to have been fired from a Raven .25 caliber automatic pistol.  One Michael M. Goins, hoping to obtain leniency in an unrelated crime, assisted police in recovering a Raven .25 caliber automatic pistol from Alum Creek in Franklin County.  There was expert testimony, based on a ballistics report, that such gun was the murder weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goins testified that in the early morning hours of December 15, 1974, James Weind, who was with Carl Osborne, Jr., in a car, had purchased a .380 automatic pistol from him.  Goins testified further that Weind had thrown the Raven pistol into Alum Creek later on the same day in the presence of Goins and another man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kay Osborne testified that her brother Carl and Weind had borrowed her car about 6:00 a. m., on December 15, 1974, and returned it at about 10:00 a. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  m., and that on those occasions Weind was wearing jeans and a dark blue and white bandana.  Kay Osborne testified further that she saw her mother go out to Kay's car with a bucket of water.  Kay was told to drive her mother's automobile to work because additional cleaning was needed on Kay's car since Weind had become ill in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was evidence that appellant had new carpeting installed in Kay's car within a few days and had replaced all the tires, as well as evidence that pretrial newspaper articles had reported that a tire print was lifted from the mud outside the schoolhouse where the body was found.  The police testified that blood stains had been found on the back of the front seat of Kay's car and on Weind's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kay Osborne's further and most incriminating testimony was that her mother had told her some time following the homicide that she was going to lose Edgel Ross because he was leaving her, and that appellant had told her daughter Kay that she had hired her son Carl and his friend Jimmy Weind to kill Mrs. Ross for the sum of $ 325.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edgel Ross in court admitted to the existence of a five-year clandestine relationship between himself and appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found Alberta Osborne guilty of kidnapping and of two counts of aggravated murder, with the specification that the homicide was for hire on both counts.  However, appellant was found not guilty of the specification that the homicide was done in the course of a kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mitigation hearing was held as required by R. C. 2929.02, 2929.03 and 2929.04.  After hearing the testimony of two psychiatrists, appellant's brother, employees of the Columbus Women's Correctional Institution and a missionary who frequented that institution, the trial court found that none of the mitigating circumstances contained in R. C. 2929.04(B) had been established.  The trial court then sentenced appellant to death, as required by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and the cause is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which affirmed her conviction for kidnapping in violation of Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(A), (B), with the specification that the murder was for hire on both counts pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(2). Defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The jury found that defendant hired her son and his friend to kill the victim, whose husband had been involved in a long-standing affair with defendant. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's assertions of error. Defendant was not denied due process of law or a fair trial because an impartial jury was obtained despite pretrial publicity. Defendant waived her challenge regarding the poor technical quality of the electronic recording of the trial proceedings because she failed to correct and supplement the record. Moreover, the court found that defendant was not prejudiced. Defendant similarly waived her right to challenge the trial court's introduction of extrajudicial statements of an alleged co-conspirator because she failed to timely object. There also was sufficient evidence to establish all of the elements of the crimes, and the trial court complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A) because it sentenced defendant on only one of the counts of aggravated murder. The court also rejected defendant's contention that Ohio's mitigating circumstances under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B) were unconstitutionally narrow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 28, 1974, Joseph Eshack, Jr., was shot and killed at his place of business located at 223 Wooster Avenue, Akron.  He was found by the Akron police lying with his face down in the aisle of his storeroom.  His business consisted of the sale and rental of used tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the police discovering Eshack, Floyd Edwards met with a friend named Standford Harris.  Edwards told Harris that he was going to rob Joseph Eshack.  Edwards asked Harris to participate and showed him a gun.  Harris consented.  Edwards and Harris entered the store and soon thereafter argued with Eshack over the price of various tools scattered over the floor.  The last item discussed was a pair of wire cutters, and, as Eshack bent over to pick them up, Edwards pulled the gun from his pocket and demanded Eshack's money.  Edwards grabbed Eshack's arm and a struggle ensued.  Edwards fired a bullet into the back of Eshack's head.  The shot was fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shot was fired, Eshack's wallet was taken.  It contained some credit cards, identification papers, other miscellaneous papers, and $ 65.  The money was divided between Edwards and Harris.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wallet was later discarded in the basement of a nearby apartment house.  Gary Hendon, a maintenance man at the Edgewood Home Apartments, found Eshack's wallet in the basement of one of the apartment buildings.  Hendon knew Edwards, and remembered seeing him in that basement two or three days before finding the wallet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 5:30 p. m., on January 9, 1975, Edwards was arrested by two detectives of the Akron police, Harold Craig and Grover Goodwell.  Following the arrest, Edwards was taken to the police station to be interrogated.  After receiving his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings from detective sergeant Russell Cross, defendant made an oral, unrecorded incriminating statement.  Also present in the room at the time of that statement were Craig and Goodwell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 8:20 p. m., later that day, Edwards, after receiving another explanation of his constitutional rights, gave a tape-recorded statement of his confession in the presence of assistant county prosecutor John Shoemaker, Cross and Goodwell.  When the prosecutor flipped the cassette to side two, it did not properly engage.  Approximately 75 feet of the tape was blank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 10:25 p. m., another recorded statement was taken to fill in the blank&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  75 feet.  Shoemaker again read Edwards his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings.  Edwards repeated his confession.  Also present in the room were Craig, and one Haywood Manning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime during the interrogation of Edwards the location of the gun was ascertained.  A search warrant was drawn and a search of 1125 Inman Court was made.  During that search, a .32 caliber automatic pistol was found.  Edwards admitted that the gun was the one he used to shoot Eshack.  This statement was recorded at 2:45 a. m. on January 10, 1975, after Edwards had again been advised of his constitutional rights by Shoemaker.  The gun was eventually physically linked to the crime through a ballistics test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was subsequently indicted by the Summit County Grand Jury for aggravated murder with two specifications, R. C. 2929.04(A)(3) and 2929.04(A)(7), and for aggravated robbery.  The defendant was arraigned on January 17, 1975, and plead not guilty.  At the arraignment, the court ordered a psychiatric examination of the defendant and set the date of the trial for March 4, 1975.  Elliot Migdal, M. D., a psychiatrist, and Daniel Rienhold, a psychologist, examined defendant prior to trial.  The jury found the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guilty of aggravated murder, guilty of the second specification and guilty of aggravated robbery.  Following a mitigation hearing, defendant was sentenced to death on the aggravated-murder charge, and was also sentenced on the aggravated-robbery charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed, and the cause is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The supreme court affirmed defendant's convictions for aggravated murder with one specification and aggravated robbery and his sentence of death. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of the aggravated robbery before the admission of defendant's confession. The confession would have been admissible without testimony of a detective who had read a court-ordered psychiatric report. Defendant received adequate Miranda warnings, and his confession was intelligent and voluntary. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a witness to testify whose name and address had not been provided to defendant. Tape-recorded confessions were admissible. The trial court did not err in not permitting defendant to comment on the fact that a witness did not testify. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01 was not ambiguous or vague. The jury instructions did not constitute prejudicial error. The Ohio statutes regarding aggravated murder and death in the electric chair did not deprive defendant equal protection. The trial court, not a psychiatrist, determined that no mitigating circumstances existed. The evidence was sufficient to support the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">According to the record, the contention of the township that several of the townships failed to meet the statutory requirement that the township budget be filed by a certain date was not raised before the commission, nor was it timely raised before the Board. There was a dispute as to the facts relevant to that issue that the court, on further appeal, would attempt to resolve. The court held that the commission acted properly in formulating an alternative method for allocating the 1976 local government fund according to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.53 and that the commission was not unreasonable or unlawful. Section 5747.53 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and was not an unconstitutional grant of administrative power, allegedly violating Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1. In affirming the Board's decision, the court found that where the Ohio General Assembly made the decision to grant the commission the alternative method of allocating its undivided county local government fund in a manner that would maximize its utility to the local communities, &sect; 5747.53 was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the decision of the Board, which affirmed the commission's allocation of the local government fund.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, 1974, at approximately 11:00 p. m., the victim, Mrs. Jeannette Nichols, was parking her 1972 Ford automobile in the lot at St. Anthony's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where she was employed as head nurse in the emergency room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she was getting out of the car four men approached her, Jerome Royster (appellant herein), John William Harris, Eric Maurice and Clarence Smith, one of whom brandished a sawed-off shotgun and demanded her keys.  She was then forced into the back seat of her car and driven to the home of Harris where she was subjected to a series of sexual assaults which occurred in Harris' home, and later in a nearby garage, and was participated in by the four men and a fifth man, Baxter Martin.  During the encounter it was discovered that Mrs. Nichols knew the name and address of Harris.  She was placed in the trunk of her automobile while her fate was argued by her assailants.  Their verdict called for her death.  Appellant and Harris took the victim's car to a field near Maryland Avenue and Sunbury Road where she was apparently forced to lie down.  Harris shot her twice in the head with a .20 gauge shotgun&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which the appellant had taken from his father's house.  Appellant acted as a lookout during the shooting, and afterward the men covered the body with an old couch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mrs. Nichols had left her home for work that evening, she had with her a purse containing several credit cards, a watch and a diamond engagement ring, a portable radio, an automatic garage door opener and her vehicle contained a bumper jack, all of which were recovered or accounted for later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, May 10, 1974, the appellant, Harris, Smith and Maurice were driven to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the home of a relative of the appellant.  They had spent the two previous days hiding in the home of Smith's girl friend.  Their driver testified that, during the trip to Philadelphia, appellant had stated that he and John Harris had shot a nurse.  The driver on returning to Columbus contacted the police and reported what he had done and heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on May 14, 1974, the Philadelphia police arrested appellant, Harris, Smith and Maurice near the home of appellant's cousin, and they were later returned to Columbus.  Appellant was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder with specifications, kidnapping, rape, aggravated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  robbery and grand theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 9, 1974, the case went to trial before a jury.  Eleven witnesses testified for the prosecution and the testimony of several other witnesses was admitted by stipulation.  Most of the physical evidence was also received by stipulation.  The appellant did not testify before the jury.  On December 14, 1974, the jury returned a verdict finding the appellant guilty of aggravated murder without specifications on count one, guilty of aggravated murder with specifications on count two, guilty of kidnapping on count three, guilty of rape on count four, guilty of aggravated robbery on count five, and guilty of grand theft on count six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physical evidence was impressive.  A brassiere and girdle of the brand, type and size worn by Mrs. Nichols was recovered from Harris' bedroom.  A sheet of fiberboard from the garage next to Harris' home contained the same kind of fibers found on the victim's clothing.  Human hair found near the fiberboard was microscopically examined and found to be identical with samples of the decedent's public hair.  The automatic garage door opener, two bumper jacks and a plastic bag were recovered from the car of Baxter Martin who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was also discovered using one of the victim's credit cards.  Teeth marks in the plastic bag were compared with dental impressions of Mrs. Nichols and found to be identical.  The Telectron automatic garage door opener was positively identified as belonging to the victim.  Tests were made on the bumper jack, disclosing certain marks identical with those found on a chrome strip taken from the recovered vehicle of the victim.  The two wheels from the vehicle sold by Martin were recovered, and certain other credit cards belonging to the victim were found in Martin's home.  Semen was identified on swabs taken from the victim's mouth, rectum and vagina.  Microscopic analysis of the vaginal swab showed type AB antigens.  Appellant and Smith had AB type blood while Harris and Maurice had type O blood as did the victim and her husband.  Type O blood does not contain A or B antigens.  It was stipulated that both appellant and Smith were &quot;secreters&quot; whose blood type antigen is found in all body secretions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more lengthy disquisition of the total evidence would be monumental, and reviewed would serve no purpose here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mitigation hearing was held on March 24, 1975.  The court found from the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evidence presented at the hearing that none of the mitigating circumstances set forth in R. C. 2929.04 was established, and sentenced the appellant to death as required by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction and the sentence, and the cause is now before this court pursuant to an appeal as a matter of right.  <BR>State v. Royster, 1975 Ohio App. LEXIS 8460 (Ohio Ct. App., Franklin County, Aug. 26, 1975)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant and some if his acquaintances kidnapped a nurse, sexually assaulted her, and killed her. The trial court sentenced defendant to death, and the sentence was affirmed by the appellate court. Defendant appealed his death sentence, arguing that the Ohio statutes that allowed the death penalty were unconstitutional. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.01, 2929.02, 2929.03, 2929.04, 2941.14, which provided for a death penalty under certain circumstances, were specifically designed to remove the uncontrolled or arbitrary sentencing discretion rejected by the United States Supreme Court. The evidence before the trial court failed to establish that defendant was duress, coercion, or strong provocation. The evidence did not show that defendant was mentally deficient. Defendant's right to contact counsel was not violated because defendant was told the day he was arrested that telephones were available for his use. There was evidence that defendant was informed of his rights and waived them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early morning hours of May 9, 1974, at a vacant lot near Maryland Ave. and Sunbury Road in the city of Columbus, Jeannette Nichols died after being shot in the head at close range with a .20 gauge shotgun.  She had been abducted a few hours earlier from the parking lot at St. Anthony's hospital by four men, including John Harris, appellant herein.  These men and one other, Baxter Martin, raped her and otherwise sexually abused her in and near the home of the appellant, robbed her and stole her automobile.  She was killed by Harris in the presence of Jerome Royster, another of the men, who first acted as a lookout and then assisted Harris in covering the body with a discarded couch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although apparently directed not to take Mrs. Nichols' credit cards, Martin did so and his indiscreet use of one of them led to the identification of all the assailants.  Upon the discovery that the police authorities had recovered the victim's body and had knowledge of their criminal involvement, the original four fled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The appellant and Royster contacted their Columbus lawyer who advised them to surrender and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  say nothing.  For whatever reason, they did not surrender, but were apprehended by the Philadelphia police on information relayed to them by Columbus police whose source was the driver of the automobile that transported them to Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was returned to Columbus where he was placed in the custody of the juvenile authorities, being of age 17 years and 9 months at the time.  After an investigation and hearing, his matter was transferred for criminal prosecution as an adult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury of Franklin County returned an indictment charging appellant with two counts of aggravated murder with specifications, and with kidnapping, rape, aggravated robbery, and grand theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 23, 1974, appellant, having waived his right to a jury trial, was tried by a panel, consisting of three judges of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court.  The manner in which the jury trial was waived later became a subject of dispute.  Also, on the first day of trial, the appellant, by his attorneys, entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity in addition to his not guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After opening statements by both sides, a voluminous stipulation encompassing the testimony of at least&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  26 witnesses and 40 exhibits, previously agreed upon, was read into the record by the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 27, 1974, the three judge panel found appellant guilty as charged in the indictment, and ordered a pre-sentence investigation and psychiatric examinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 8, 1974, pursuant to R. C. 2929.03(D), a mitigation hearing was held, at which none of the mitigating circumstances under R. C. 2929.04(B) were found to be established by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court elected to sentence the appellant on the first count of the indictment and imposed the death penalty.  In addition, terms of years were meted out for counts 3, 4, 5 and 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion for a new trial was subsequently overruled, and upon appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant, a 17-year-old juvenile, appealed his conviction for aggravated murder with specifications, kidnapping, rape, aggravated robbery, and grand theft. The trial court imposed the death sentence and the Court of Appeals (Ohio) affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant first asserted that his statements to police should have been suppressed. However, the court noted that a juvenile was legally capable of making a voluntary confession. The court concluded that defendant was advised by counsel concerning his rights in a telephone call prior to his arrest, that defendant was fully advised by the police at least twice prior to making statements, and that defendant had been given a clear, understandable warning of all his rights. The court also found no error in the imposition of the death penalty. The court held that there was no evidence of prosecutorial discretion through selective prosecution and that the death penalty applied equally to adults and juveniles tried as adults. As to defendant's waiver of a jury trial, the court found that, although his written waiver was not on file at the time of trial, his waiver was clearly reflected in the record and in the written waiver that he signed at the time of the court's verdict. Finally, the court held that defendant had failed to present evidence to support his argument that a mental deficiency should have been considered as a mitigating circumstance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;C. No person shall sell, deliver, transfer, or furnish any handgun to any person without first having notified the Director of Finance of his intention so to do not less than five days prior thereto.

Upon resumption of questioning, his rights were again read from a statement that was then initialed by him. He refused to sign a written waiver of his rights. Defendant challenged his sentence on various grounds, including the voluntariness of statements he made to the police. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. First, the court noted that defendant's claim that Ohio's death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment had been decided by the court, and it rejected his argument. The court found that defendant's repeated refusal to sign a written waiver of his rights did not require the police to discontinue interrogatories. The court determined that defendant's rights were effectively and intelligently waived by the independent decision of the defendant to speak voluntarily and without coercion, actual or presumed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court improperly conducted the mitigation hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 16, 1974, at about 11:00 p. m., police discovered Julius Graber lying in the woods in Spring Grove Cemetery in Hamilton County critically injured from a shotgun wound to the back of his head.  He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately one week thereafter, Willie Lee Bell, defendant-appellant, was arrested for the murder of Julius Graber.  Samuel Hall, Bell's companion, was arrested the day after Graber's body was discovered.  Bell was then a minor of 16 years of age, and Hall was an adult.  Following proceedings in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas, Bell was bound over to the Hamilton County Grand Jury and was indicted jointly with Hall on two counts of aggravated murder, under R. C. 2903.01, with specifications of aggravated robbery and of kidnapping pursuant to R. C. 2929.04(A)(7).  Bell entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and Hall were tried separately.  The trial court found Bell to be sane and competent to stand trial, overruled a motion to suppress any inculpatory statements, and accepted Bell's waiver of trial by jury and request to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be tried by a three-judge panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record tends to reveal the following series of events.  On October 16, 1974, Bell and Hall went to a community center in Cincinnati, following which they went to Hall's home to borrow his brother's Grand Prix Pontiac automobile.  In that car, Bell and Hall proceeded to Victory Parkway, where they observed a 1974 blue Chevrolet.  When the Chevrolet turned into a parking garage, Hall, driving his brother's car, did the same, and followed it to the second level of the garage.  After the Chevrolet was parked, Hall got out of the Pontiac with a 20-gauge &quot;sawed-off&quot; shotgun and accosted the Chevrolet's driver, 64-year-old Julius Graber.  Graber was forced into the trunk of his own vehicle, and Hall drove that car, with Bell following in the Pontiac, and parked it near his home.  Bell parked the Pontiac at Hall's home, and then drove Graber's Chevrolet toward Spring Grove Cemetery.  After driving past the cemetery, Bell stopped, reversed direction, and then backed the car into a lane that went inside the cemetery premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, Robert Pierce, Jr., a resident of an apartment building near the cemetery, had just returned from work and was sitting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the parking lot of the building listening to his car radio.  Pierce observed a vehicle stopped in the cemetery with its parking lights on.  He heard two car doors close, one after the other, turned his radio down to listen, and then heard a voice plead &quot;Don't shoot me.  Don't shoot me.&quot; Pierce turned his radio off, and shortly thereafter heard one shot, followed, after an interval, by a second shot.  He then saw the interior light of the car go on, and a man enter the parked car on the passenger side and move behind the wheel.  Pierce heard two car doors close, saw the interior light go off, and then watched the car leave the cemetery, without any lights on.  Pierce called the police, around 10:50 p. m., who subsequently discovered Graber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall and Bell drove to Dayton, where they spent the night in the Graber Chevrolet.  The following morning, Bell driving, they stopped at a service station to ask directions for finding work.  After questioning the attendant, Bell and Hall left, but shortly returned.  Hall then thrust a shotgun at the attendant, Kenneth B. Hardin, took the keys to Hardin's automobile, forced him into the trunk of his car, and drove it away from the station.  Bell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  followed in Graber's Chevrolet.  The Hardin car, however, was stopped by a State Highway Patrolman, and when Hardin pounded on the trunk lid, he was discovered and released by the officer.  Hall was arrested, and the shotgun was found and removed from the car's interior.  Meanwhile, Bell, who was still following, proceeded back to Cincinnati, abandoned the Chevrolet on Beatrice Avenue, and returned to his residence on Preston Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately one week later, following the interrogation of Hall and other investigative effort, Cincinnati police appeared at the Bell residence.  Bell was taken to police headquarters to answer questions in connection with the Hall investigation and was given his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings.  When the answers to preliminary questions indicated a possible connection with Hall, Bell was again given his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings.  Approximately one hour later, Bell was given his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings a third time on a printed &quot;Notification of Rights&quot; form, whereupon he signed the &quot;Waiver of Rights&quot; portion.  Bell was asked to make a recorded statement, and was advised that he could have his mother present.  Although Bell indicated that he did not want his mother present, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the officer called Bell's mother to tell her that her son was involved in a homicide, a kidnapping and an armed robbery, and that he was going to be charged with the offenses.  An offer was made to transport her to headquarters to be with her son when he made his statement, but she declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recorded statement was taken from Bell which was eventually received in evidence.  It confirmed most of the above factual details, but denied any intention of Bell to take part in a homicide.  Bell conceded his presence during the kidnapping of Graber, but claimed he was not aware of the shotgun until Hall got out of the Pontiac in the parking garage to threaten Graber with it.  Bell conceded driving Graber's car to the cemetery and backing into the cemetery lane, but insisted that it was Hall who removed Graber from the trunk, and that it was Hall who took Graber into the bushes.  Bell said he then heard a shot and Graber pleading for his life.  After the first shot, according to Bell's recorded statement, Hall ran back to the vehicle to get another shotgun shell and then returned to the bushes, whereupon Bell heard the second shot.  Hall then drove Bell to Dayton where the incident with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  service station attendant occurred.  In his statement, Bell attributed the active part of the incident to Hall, but admitted following Hall in Graber's Chevrolet for some 20 minutes before Hall was stopped by the highway patrolman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional expert testimony identified a shell casing found at the scene of the homicide as having been fired from the shotgun found in the car Hall was driving at the time of his arrest in Dayton, and also identified a latent fingerprint from the outside window on the driver's side of the Graber car as being that of Bell's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Graber had been pronounced dead at the hospital, where attendants discovered that he had secreted money and other valuables in his shoes, his body was taken to the morgue.  A post-mortem examination revealed that death had resulted from a wound to the rear of the head inflicted by a shotgun shell at near-contact range.  Testimony established that the head and hand wounds Graber received were consistent with the theory that the fatal shot was fired while Graber's hands were clasped behind his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense offered only one witness, a Columbus police officer who had interrogated and taken several statements from Hall.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statements were not, however, offered in evidence at the trial, and the case went to the panel on the basis of the evidence presented by the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of trial, the panel unanimously found Bell guilty of aggravated murder as charged on the second court of the indictment, and guilty of the specification to the second count, that the aggravated murder was committed during a kidnapping.  Bell was also found guilty of the third and fourth counts of aggravated robbery and of kidnapping, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following pre-sentence and psychiatric examination, a mitigation hearing was held pursuant to R. C. 2929.03 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The panel found that none of the mitigating circumstances specified in R. C. 2929.04(B) had been established by a preponderance of the evidence.  Bell was sentenced to 7 to 25 years on the kidnapping charge; to 7 to 25 years on the aggravated robbery charge, to run consecutively with the first sentence; and to death by electrocution on the aggravated murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and the cause is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers of the Columbus Police Department, on December 20, 1974, in the execution of a search warrant, conducted a search of a residence at 1953 Oakland Park Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of that search, the defendants, Mae Diana and Rosenell Susi, were indicted on four counts relating to gambling, and a fifth count of being in violation of R.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon trial to a jury, defendants were convicted of two gambling counts and of the fifth count of being in violation of R. C. 2921.12.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after midnight on July 17, 1974, the Cincinnati police received a telephone call from a woman who said that she had seen a man on the roof of the United Dairy Farmers store at 2373 Florence Avenue in Cincinnati.  That information was broadcast to patrol cars in the area and several officers responded.  One of the officers, Patrolman Terry Kramer, observed two men looking over their shoulders while walking on Florence Avenue in the vicinity of the store, and he reported that information over the police radio.  Another officer, Patrolman David Cole, also responded to the broadcast and was approaching the scene along Florence Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just after he made his broadcast, Patrolman Kramer heard a series of gunshots.  Other officers also heard the shots and came to the scene.  Patrolman Cole was lying in the street at the rear of his cruiser, dying from multiple gunshot wounds.  Cole was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, and the subsequent autopsy and ballistics examination disclosed that he had been shot by both a .22 and a .38 caliber weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roland Reaves, the defendant in case No. 76-155, was arrested on July&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  18, 1974, in Cincinnati and subsequently made statements to investigating officers which implicated Ricardo Woods, the defendant in case No. 76-137.  Woods was arrested on July 19, 1974, in West Virginia at the home of his mother.  After the arrival of Cincinnati police, Woods made a complete statement as to his part in the events leading up to and following the homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both defendants were charged with multiple counts of aggravated murder with specifications.  Reaves was tried before a jury, and Woods before a three-judge panel.  The evidence presented at the two trials was virtually identical.  It established that Woods had been living with Reaves' sister for some time and had recently been laid off from his construction job.  Woods and Reaves met for the first time, about two weeks before the killing, when Reaves came to Cincinnati from Chicago.  Woods stated that on July 16, he and Reaves agreed that they needed money, and, using Woods' unemployment check as funds, Reaves negotiated the purchase of a .38 caliber revolver, which Reaves told the seller he planned to use to rob a loan company.  Later, around midnight, Reaves, accompanied by Woods, parked his car close to the United&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dairy Farmers store, and both men began to &quot;case&quot; the store.  According to Woods' statement, they could see the store manager inside.  The plan was to wait until the manager came out and to &quot;hold him up and take the money.&quot; Reaves had the .38 caliber revolver and Woods had a .22 caliber pistol which Reaves had brought from Chicago.  Reaves then left Woods as a lookout across the street, and climbed onto the roof of the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaves descended from the roof and joined Woods who said that &quot;things looked funny.&quot; Apparently, they had heard the sirens of a fire department unit making a run nearby.  Woods and Reaves were walking away from the store and down Florence Avenue when Patrolman Cole skidded to a stop near the curb.  Woods stated that he leaned in the front passenger window of the police cruiser to talk to Cole just as the officer was getting out on the opposite side of the car, and that when Cole got to the rear of the cruiser, Reaves began to fire at him, the first bullet striking Cole in the chest.  Reaves fired three or four times, and Woods also shot at Cole, who at that time was lying on the street, as he and Reaves fled the scene.  Cole fired four shots without hitting the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fleeing men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair ran to the house of a friend nearby, changed clothes, and drove away in the friend's car.  Woods left the next morning for his mother's home in West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At their separate trials, Reaves and Woods were each found guilty of aggravated murder, under a count in the indictment charging that they had purposely caused the death of Patrolman Cole while fleeing immediately after attempting to commit aggravated robbery, and guilty of the second specification, that at the time of the offense the victim was a law-enforcement officer whom they knew to be such, and who at the time was engaged in his duties.  Following mitigation hearings, both defendants were sentenced to death.  The Court of Appeals affirmed both judgments in separate opinions, and the causes are now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

They were scared away from the store by the sound of sirens. The first defendant was the mastermind of the robbery. His conviction and sentence were affirmed based on a prior decision that the death penalty statute was constitutional and also on a finding that there was no error in the selection of jury members. The second defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to prove an attempted robbery, which should have resulted in a reduction of the charge against him to murder. He also asserted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B)(2) he should not have received the death penalty because he was coerced into taking part in the attempted robbery. The court affirmed. Defendants were guilty of attempted robbery because they had taken all of the necessary steps towards committing the robbery, and but for the sirens, they would have followed through on their plan. And, although defendant two might have been coerced into committing the robbery, he was not coerced into shooting the officer, and therefore, he was properly sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in the morning of February 27, 1974, the Akron police received a telephone call from Samuel J. Howze, Jr., reporting &quot;two dead people in the park.&quot; Two detectives met Howze on a street corner at about 3:30 a. m., and, after contacting two uniformed police units, the detectives accompanied Howze to Perkins Park in Akron.  A search was made of the park, and, in the course of that search, the police discovered the bodies of a man and a woman lying face down near a tree.  Each victim had been shot once in the head, and in each case the powder burns and other characteristics of the wound indicated that the muzzle of the gun had been in direct contact with the skin of the deceased.  The opinion of the examining coroner was that both had been shot sometime between 4:30 p. m., and 10:30 p. m., the previous day, and that death had been instantaneous for the man, but that the woman had lived for a few minutes after the shooting.  The victims were identified as Mr. and Mrs. Paul Anthony.  They had been abducted at gunpoint from the parking lot of a K-Mart Shopping Center in Akron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the information furnished by Howze, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police went to the home of Mrs. Ada Bayless, at about 8:15 on the morning of the 27th, armed with an arrest warrant executed on February 1, 1974, charging her grandson, the defendant, Carl Lamont Bayless, with being a delinquent under R. C. 2151.02.  Mrs. Bayless told police that her grandson was present.  Police searched the house and discovered the defendant hiding in a crawl space in the attic.  He pointed a revolver at the officers and threatened to kill them, and said he knew he was wanted for the two murders in Perkins Park.  Eventually, his mother persuaded him to throw down the revolver and come out.  In the attic, at the spot where Bayless was found, police recovered a voter's registration card with Paul Anthony's name on it, a Master Charge card belonging to Mrs. Anthony's family business, a wristwatch, and a wallet containing $ 319 in cash and a pay receipt from a restaurant, Church's Chickken, which had been robbed the night before.  Later, in searching the defendant, police found a ladies wristwatch in his pocket and a wedding band on a finger of his right hand with the Anthonys' initials engraved inside the ring.  The Anthonys' car, a black and white Cadillac, was parked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a short distance from the Bayless home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 6, 1974, the defendant was indicted on four counts of aggravated murder with specifications and on three counts of aggravated robbery.  The indictment was later amended to charge two counts of aggravated murder, with three specifications on each count, and one count of aggravated robbery.  The defendant entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murders and defendant's arrest received extensive publicity in the local news media, and the trial judge ordered restrictions upon statements by officers of the court.  Two special venires were summoned, and a jury was selected after a lengthy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The trial judge, at that time, denied a defense motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, two witnesses, Sam Colvin and the aforementioned Samuel Howze, testified that they had spoken to the defendant at his home early in the evening of February 26, and that he had shown them a gun and talked about pulling a &quot;hustle&quot; and getting some money.  Colvin left with the defendant, and the pair separated about four or five blocks from the parking lot from which the Anthonys were abducted shortly afterwards.  Howze testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he left the Bayless home to go to his mother's house, and that later that evening, at about 11:00, he next saw the defendant at his mother's house with the Anthonys' car.  The defendant allegedly told Howze that he had taken the car from some people at the K-Mart and put them in the trunk, and that, after transporting them to Perkins Park, he shot them because &quot;the man tried to play hero.&quot; Howze also testified that the defendant told several people in a bar about the shootings; that he and the defendant picked up Colley Smith, Jr., and Jeanette Mason and drove through Perkins Park where the defendant indicated that the bodies were &quot;over there&quot;; that Smith and the defendant discussed robbing Church's Chicken; that the defendant left with Smith and returned about 45 minutes later with money taken from the restaurant; and that Howze called the police about two hours later -- early in the morning of the 27th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeannette Mason testified that she was at Colley Smith's house, at about 10:30 p. m. on the 26th, when the defendant drove up alone in a white and black Cadillac, and that Smith later told her that he and the defendant talked about going to Church's Chicken to get money; that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant came back at about 12:30 a.m. with Howze and drove her home; that Howze and Smith were also in the car; that the defendant drove slowly through Perkins Park on the way to her home; that she saw somebody lying in the park near a tree, and that she told the defendant she had seen a man and asked the defendant to stop the car, but he said &quot;he had already seen it&quot; and it was only &quot;some trash or some garbage or something.&quot; Colley Smith largely confirmed Miss Mason's testimony, and also stated that, after dropping off Miss Mason and Howze, the defendant indicated to him that he had shot a man and a lady, and that &quot;he touched the lady and it sounded like she was coming back alive so he cut out.&quot; Smith also described the robbery by the defendant of Church's Chicken at about 2:00 that morning.  The manager of Church's Chicken gave similar testimony as to the details of the robbery.  Other evidence for the state included testimony concerning the discovery of the bodies and the arrest of the defendant; expert testimony identifying the defendant's fingerprint on the steering wheel of the car and identifying the defendant's gun as the type used to fire the bullets which killed the Anthonys, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  although the bullets were too mutilated to positively identify the gun as the murder weapon; and testimony by another witness that the defendant told him about the killings on the evening of February 26 and gave him an umbrella belonging to the Anthonys which the defendant had taken from the trunk of the Anthonys' car.  A state witness also testified that four days before the murder of the Anthonys, the defendant had abducted her at gunpoint from a shopping center parking lot, robbed her, and left her locked in the trunk of her car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense called the defendant's grandmother, Ada Bayless, who testified that the defendant had been home at about 5:00 or 5:30 p. m. on the 26th, and that she had let him in early the following morning.  A defense psychologist testified that, in his opinion, the defendant had the mental ability to know the consequences of his act, and to know it was unlawful, but did not have the emotional capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law because of a lack of conscience or of any feelings of guilt and remorse attached to a wrong act.  The main defense witness was the defendant.  He testified that Howze had abducted and presumably killed the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anthonys.  Defendant's account was that he had driven to the K-Mart with Howze to steal a car at Howze's suggestion, and that Howze had taken defendant's gun and driven off with the Anthonys in their car.  The defendant claimed that he had fallen behind the Anthonys' car at a traffic light while following it to the park; that he had later seen Howze leaving the park in the Anthony's car; and that he had then returned the car he was driving, which was borrowed from a friend, taken over the Anthonys' car from Howze, and kept it.  The defendant admitted robbing Church's Chicken, but denied abducting the state's witness or abducting and killing the Anthonys.  On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned defendant about statements he had made to the police after his arrest which contradicted his testimony on the stand.  The defendant admitted to lying in the earlier statements, but repeated that his testimony was the truth and claimed that several witnesses were lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rebuttal, the prosecution offered the testimony of two sheriff's deputies that while the defendant was in custody following his arrest, he threatened to kill them.  The state also called the owner of the car the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claimed to have borrowed on the day of the killings, who testified that he did not loan the defendant his car on that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found the defendant guilty of both counts of aggravated murder, guilty of two of the three specifications on each count, and guilty of aggravated robbery.  Following a mitigation hearing the defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals overruled all the defendant's assignments of error, and the cause is now before this court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, and was sentenced to death. The appellate court affirmed, and on further appeal, the judgment was affirmed. Ohio's statutory framework for the imposition of capital punishment was constitutional. It closely conformed to the bifurcated proceedings that had previously been found constitutional. Jurors who, because of opinions for or against capital punishment, could not be fair and impartial in determining guilt or innocence could properly be excused for cause. The pretrial publicity did not prevent the impaneling of a fair and impartial jury, and it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a motion for change of venue. The allowance of questions related to threats made to officers was harmless error because defendant's testimony was so thoroughly impeached that the court found no reasonable possibility that the erroneous evidence could have contributed to the conviction. The exclusion of the public from the courtroom for certain testimony, while troubling, was primarily for defendant's benefit and was done with the consent of counsel, and no prejudice was indicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court affirmed the judgment that affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Roger L. Strodes, was convicted of both aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.  The indictment specified that the murder was committed while appellant was in the commission of an aggravated robbery, one of the seven aggravating circumstances listed in R. C. 2929.04(A).  Such specification was proved beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury.  Thereafter, none of the three mitigating factors enumerated in R. C. 2929.04(B) was found to exist.  Therefore, the trial court, as required by R. C. 2929.03, sentenced the defendant to death on the aggravated-murder conviction, and sentenced him further to imprisonment from six to twenty-five years on the aggravated-robbery conviction should the death sentence be modified by another court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither in the Court of Appeals nor in this court has the appellant recited the allegations of fact that were the basis of the charges against him.  No assignment of error attacks the adequacy of the evidence, which reveals that on the night of January 8, 1974, Roger L. Strodes met with an accomplice to plan a robbery; that Strodes had borrowed a gun earlier that evening; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that after driving around, both men entered Baker's Sundries in Springfield, and Strodes announced a robbery.  The deceased Dwight Baker, was later found in the store with numerous bullet wounds in the head and chest.  Witnesses for the state included the accomplice, the lender of the gun, a girl shopping in the store, and a boy who was across the street.  Strodes relied on the defense of alibi and presented several witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and the cause is now before this court as a matter of right, pursuant to Section 2(B)(2)(a)(ii), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the imposition of the death sentence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.01- 2929.04 was not unconstitutional. Defendant contended that that the selection of his jury was in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2313.08 because the jury selection process included a disportionate number of black jurors. The court found that there was no showing of a systematic or intentional exclusion by defendant. The selection was made in good faith with no displayed prejudice to defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Darke County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 3, 1973, appellants, 12 parents of schoolage children, were indicted by a grand jury of Darke County, Ohio, for failure to send their children to school in accordance with R. C. 3321.38, which provides, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) No parent, guardian, or other person having care of a child of compulsory school age shall violate Section 3321.01, 3321.03, 3321.04, 3321.07, 3321.10, 3321.19, 3321.20, or 3331.14 of the Revised Code.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, appellants were charged with violation of R. C. 3321.03, which provides, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Except as provided in this section, the parent, guardian, or other person having the care of a child of compulsory school age which child has not been determined to be incapable of profiting substantially by further instruction shall cause such child to attend a school which conforms to the minimum standards prescribed by the State Board of Education for the full time the school attended is in session, or shall otherwise cause him to be instructed in accordance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with law.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause was tried to the court on May 7 and 8, 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning of the trial, the state and the defendants stipulated to the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Number 1. That the Darke County Court of Common Pleas, Darke County, Ohio, has jurisdiction and venue over this cause, and defendants herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Number 2. That the defendants are the parents of a child, or children of compulsory school age; and that said parents are not sending the child, or children in the public school in the district wherein the parents or defendants reside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Number 3. That the defendants are the parents of a child, or children of compulsory school age, and that said parents are sending the child, or children to the Tabernacle Christian School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Number 4. That the children, or child of the defendants were not excused under any conditions from attendance or absence from the school in the district wherein the parents defendants reside by any lawful authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony received at trial revealed that appellants' children were attending the Tabernacle Christian School, a non-public religious elementary school located in Bradford, Ohio.  The state alleged that the Tabernacle Christian School did&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not conform to the &quot;minimum standards&quot; promulgated by the State Board of Education pursuant to the express statutory command of R. C. 3301.07, which standards are made applicable to the schools in operation in this state by R. C. 3321.03, and are contained within a publication entitled Minimum Standards for Ohio Elementary Schools, Revised 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the Tabernacle Christian School, one of the appellants, Reverend Levi Whisner, testified that he had called the office of the State Board of Education in early October 1973, in an attempt to arrange a meeting for the purpose of discussing the continued operation of the school, which at that time was in its embryonic stage of development, having first opened its doors on September 4, 1973.  A meeting was scheduled for October 5, 1973, but Rev. Whisner was unable to keep that appointment.  Subsequently, on January 22, 1974, a meeting was held in the office of the State Board of Education in Columbus, at which time Rev. Whisner, accompanied by his attorney, discussed the Tabernacle Christian School with Mr. John E. Brown, Director of the Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 28, 1974, Rev. Whisner wrote a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  letter to Brown reviewing the meeting of January 22.  The letter, which was received into evidence as plaintiff's exhibit E, concluded:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Upon receiving a favorable response to this letter, we will submit to the Department of Education, on or before April 1, 1974, a plan showing the total school organization and program.  Such plan will contain information and commitments on our part corresponding to those contained in your publication 'Minimum Standards for Ohio Elementary Schools,' so far as is consistent with our religious beliefs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Education did not respond to Rev. Whisner's letter, nor did Rev. Whisner, on behalf of the Tabernacle Christian School, submit &quot;a plan showing the total school organization and program&quot; to the State Board of Education.  Apparently, no further attempts were made by either the State Board of Education or by the appellants to resolve the situation concerning the operation of the Tabernacle Christian School through the administrative procedures specifically devised for such purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the presentation of its case, the state called the aforementioned Mr. John E. Brown to the witness stand.  Brown testified that the functions of the Department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Education include the process of approval and chartering of schools, and the development of standards for elementary and secondary schools.  With respect to the development of standards, Brown stated that representatives of both public and non-public, including religious, schools participated in the formulation of the &quot;minimum standards&quot; with which all schools in this state must comply in order to begin, or continue, operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown testified further, on direct examination, that the publication Minimum Standards for Ohio Elementary Schools is divided into two sections, entitled (1) Minimum Standards for Elementary Schools of the state of Ohio, and (2) Interpretative and Explanatory Information.  According to Brown, the former section of the publication, comprising the first 15 pages, contains the &quot;minimum standards&quot; with which all elementary schools, whether public or non-public, must comply, while the latter section is merely explanatory of the former, and is intended only to aid school administrators in developing programs which comport with the required &quot;minimum standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the Tabernacle Christian School, Brown testified that no application for a charter had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been filed with the State Board of Education by the school, and, consequently, the school was not chartered.  He stated that although it is difficult for a new school to meet the &quot;minimum standards,&quot; it is possible to do so, and it has been done.  He related the procedure to be followed by a new non-tax supported school in order to obtain a charter, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Prior approval of a plan submitted for the total school organization and program shall have been granted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. An enrollment of fifteen pupils in the first grade level or organization shall be minimum for the initial year of operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. There shall be an annual increase of enrollment until the minimum requirements of Section D have been met [60 students].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. In self-contained classroom situations, which are not designated as nongraded or multi-aged groups, not more than two grade levels shall be combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The governing body of the school shall be responsible for initiating an application for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. A charter shall be granted after an inspection which determines that all standards have been met.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination, Brown attempted to explain the difference&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the &quot;minimum standards&quot; and the &quot;interpretative and explanatory information&quot; sections of the aforementioned publication.  He testified, in this regard, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first part of the book up to that point are the standards we have gone through -- there, chapter 19, and have been filed with the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The interpretative sections are the guidelines to direct schools and the Department in interpreting the first part of the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second part is not a part of the file with the Secretary of State, though they are there in compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q. Are they not a part of the minimum standards?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A. Yes, they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter followed this exchange between counsel for the appellants, and Brown, with regard to the &quot;interpretative and explanatory information&quot; section of the aforesaid publication, which is itself divided into two parts (level one and level two):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q. * * * how do you differentiate, how does the department differentiate between level one and level two in terms of requirement, the requirement factor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A. Level one is a guideline for the minimal level.  Those schools that are looking for quality.  Attempt to have a direction moving in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  level two.  Here again is a guideline to a higher quality of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q. Can level one be ignored by a school in terms of the department?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A. Should not be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q. Should not be.  I will repeat the question.  May level 1 be ignored by a school?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A. No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown also testified, on cross-examination, that a school may be approved even though it is not in compliance with one minimum standard, as long as there is &quot;a possibility that it could be corrected within a reasonable length of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, on redirect examination, Brown testified that if a school failed to comply with the &quot;standards&quot; listed in the interpretative and explanatory information section of the aforesaid publication, it, nevertheless, &quot;could be [chartered] as a matter of interpretation on the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In defense of the charges, appellants presented numerous witnesses.  The first defense witness to testify was Rev. Whisner.  He testified that he was the pastor of the Tabernacle Christian Church and the principal of its school.  With regard to the relationship between the church and the school, Rev. Whisner stated that &quot;[t]hey are the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Whisner testified as to the fundamental precepts of the religion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  observed by the members of the Tabernacle Christian Church.  He stated that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a historical religion that dates back to the New Testament.  I like to think of it as a New Testament religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a religion that involves several basic things.  What we refer to as the new birth, being born again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bible says, 'Not of corruptible seed, but uncorruptible.  Being a new creature in Christ.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My religion involves a life of separation from sin.  A life of separation from worldiness [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">], and ungodliness, and a life devoted to the propagation of this Gospel that I have seen transform lives, and prepare people not only for the judgment here, but for the judgment to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He defined the Tabernacle Christian Church as &quot;[b]eing historical and reaching back to the early church in the New Testament.&quot; He further defined the church as being &quot;dependent in the fact that we are solely dependent upon God for His mercy and His grace and His strength;&quot; as being &quot;independent [in the sense that] we are not tied to any religious system;&quot; and as being &quot;interdependent in that we as a fellowship group in the Body of Christ, are dependent upon one anothers help and encouragement, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fellowship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Whisner testified that the members of the Tabernacle Christian Church &quot;don't engage in some things such as drinking, and card playing, and things of this nature that a lot would out here.  We try to have a standard, and do enforce a standard of modesty, standard of humility, and a standard of sobriety, and a standard of prayerfullness, and again, I say, a standard of separation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the Tabernacle Christian School, Rev. Whisner testified that &quot;[i]t is a religious school in the sense that it is a Bible oriented Christian school.  It is a Christian school in the area that we feel that children need Bible guidance for their spiritual and moral foundations.  It is a religious school, or Christian school in the sense that we feel that our students need the influence of a Godly teacher, which we in our requirements for teachers that they be born again teachers.  It is a religious school in the sense that we draw lines of separation from the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Whisner related that the school was founded because &quot;we wanted to give our children a good spiritual and moral foundation.  A Bible foundation to guide their lives, and prepare them for the hideous things&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that are surely there facing in this generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an additional reason, Rev. Whisner stated that &quot;we could not find in this general area a school that afforded us what we felt that our children must have, and basics that should be instilled in our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Whisner testified further that the Tabernacle Christian School does not receive any form of state or federal aid, and would not accept it if offered, because &quot;[a]nything they give to you they control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the question of the interest of the state in the education of the children residing therein, Rev. Whisner stated that &quot;I believe the state has a right to expect and receive an adequate education.  I think the state has a right to think and see that they [the children] be safe and be protected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Whisner testified at some length as to the nature and quality of the education afforded the students enrolled at the Tabernacle Christian School.  He stated that the students were instructed by Mrs. Myrtle Smits, who is certified to teach in the states of Ohio, Illinois, West Virginia and Kentucky.  He asserted that such subjects as math, social studies, history (including Ohio history), civics, spelling, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  english, science, reading, art, music, and physical education are taught at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rev. Whisner, the school utilizes the curriculum nationally known as the Accelerated Christian Education program (A. C. E.).  Rev. Whisner described the A. C. E. program as &quot;Bible-oriented&quot; in that scriptural passages are contained within the teaching materials.  Under the A. C. E. method of instruction, students work at their own speed and progress through &quot;paces&quot; or &quot;packets&quot; of specially developed material.  Each student is expected to complete at least 12 &quot;paces&quot; in each subject per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Whisner testified also that the school operates six hours a day, 180 days per year; that reports of daily attendance are made to public officials; and that the school admits public officials for the purpose of health, safety and fire inspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Whisner testified extensively as to the objections upon religious, educational, and economic grounds raised by the Tabernacle Christian School to the state's minimum standards.  In summary, the school objected to minimum standards 401-02(E)(6), 401-02(G)(6), 401-02(O), and 401-07, and to interpretative sections 401-02(I) and 401-02(G), on religious&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grounds, and to minimum standards 401-02(D), 401-02(G), 401-02(O), 401-03(F), and 401-05(L), and to interpretative sections 401-02(B), 401-02(D), 401-02(G), and 401-03(F) on educational and economic grounds.  These objections will be discussed in some detail in the body of this opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Myrtle Smits, the teacher at the Tabernacle Christian School, appeared as a defense witness.  She testified that, in her professional opinion, the program of education utilized at the Tabernacle Christian School &quot;is very good.&quot; As evidence supporting her opinion, Mrs. Smits stated that her students' achievement on the nationally recognized Stanford Achievement Test was &quot;excellent.&quot; Of the 20 students who took the test, 18 performed well, and only two did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the other parents, Mr. Hollis Flora and defendant Mrs. Paul Quinn, testified for the defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flora stated that he believed it to be his &quot;duty as a parent to provide for the material and spiritual welfare of my children according to the will of God as I understand it, which is the redemption of Jesus Christ.&quot; He further testified that, in his view, &quot;the school must be able to give my children a good basic sound education * * * in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an atmosphere that is compatible with my Christian beliefs.&quot; Moreover, Flora remarked that, under present conditions, he could not, as a matter of conscience, enroll his children in public school, and that the Tabernacle Christian School is the only school within reasonable travelling distance in which he could, in conscience, enroll his children.  Finally, Flora testified that he and his wife &quot;are extremely well pleased with the academic progress of our children&quot; in the Tabernacle Christian School, despite the fact that the school is not chartered by the state or in total compliance with its &quot;minimum standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Quinn testified that her children are enrolled in the Tabernacle Christian School because of the &quot;moral breakdown in our public schools, and because I feel it is my duty as a parent to give my children the best education possible.&quot; In this regard, she stated that her obligations to her children are elucidated in Proverbs 22, verse 6: &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.&quot; Mrs. Quinn testified further that the Tabernacle Christian School is the only educational institution within reasonable travelling distance of her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  home in which she could, consistent with her conscience, enroll her children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense and the state then stipulated that the testimony of the other defendant-parents would be the same as that previously rendered by Rev. Whisner, Mr. Flora and Mrs. Quinn with regard to their view of the Tabernacle Christian School as a religious school, their religious reason for having their children in the school, their knowledge that the school is not one that complies with the minimum standards, and the fact that they feel they cannot enroll their children elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the conclusion of the trial, the defense presented two expert witnesses, Mr. Ralph O'Neal West and Professor Donald A. Erickson, both of whom testified that they had read and were familiar with the publication, Minimum Standards for Ohio Elementary Schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West, the Director of Evaluation for the Commission on Independent Secondary Schools of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, testified that since 1961 he has spent virtually all his time working on problems of evaluation of non-public schools.  With regard to the Minimum Standards for Ohio Elementary Schools, West testified that &quot;there is an apparent failure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the document to spell out clearly the procedures for a school seeking approval&quot;; that the standards command that &quot;a private school, a non-tax supported school is [be] effectively under the control of the local school board of education for all activities of the school&quot;; &quot;that for non-public schools, non-tax supported schools, there is a severe question on both education [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] and other grounds for the necessity for certification as a qualification for hiring a person as a teacher in one of these schools&quot;; that &quot;there is an increasing concern over the validity of the selection by the state of text books for schools with diverse educational philosophical * * * goals and purposes&quot;; and finally that, in his opinion, there is no compelling state interest in requiring a non-public school to conform to each of the minimum standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erickson, a professor at the University of Chicago, testified that he has worked extensively in studying non-public education, including the question of what controls should be imposed upon non-public schools.  Erickson stated that he is &quot;of the firm position that the state has some farreaching fundamental educational responsibilities,&quot; but that &quot;the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  state can fulfill all its fundamental responsibilities in education without prescribing how people must be educated; where they must be educated; what kind of buildings they must be educated in; what must be in the program; and what must be the nature of the individual who instructs them.&quot; With regard to Ohio's minimum standards, Erickson commented that &quot;I am vastly confused by these standards, and I don't know how I would advise a school administrator to proceed on the basis of that document.&quot; He testified further that the standards &quot;go a long way down the road toward obliterating any distinction between public and private education&quot;; that the standards are not neutral in that a philosophy of &quot;secular humanism&quot; is espoused therein; that enforcement of the standards would &quot;in effect take away from the school the right to run its [own] philosophy&quot;; that the school day and curriculum content required by the standards are, educationally, &quot;very close to nonsense&quot;; that there is no apparent reason to impose teacher certification requirements upon non-public schools, although in public education these are &quot;probably a necessary evil, because public education is a massive enterprise&quot;; that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ohio's minimum standards &quot;are about the weakest way I know of to try to accomplish what they are designed to accomplish, and that is to make schools better&quot;; and that &quot;I don't think the state has any compelling interest at all in requiring schools to live up to the minimum standards in this book as a whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the uncontradicted testimony of Rev. Whisner, Flora and Quinn revealed these appellants to be lawabiding and upright citizens in all respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the trial, defendants moved in writing for acquittal of the charges on the basis that, as applied to them, the compulsory attendance law constitutes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">First</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a violation by the state of the right of the defendants and their children to the free exercise of </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant parents were convicted of failing to send their children to school, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3321.38, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3321.03. The Court of Appeals for Darke County (Ohio) affirmed the convictions. The parents sought review of the appellate court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The parents' children attended a nonpublic, religious elementary school. The State alleged that the parents violated &sect; 3321.03 because the school did not conform to the minimum educational standards promulgated by the State's board of education. The parents challenged their convictions on the grounds that the standards infringed upon their right to freely exercise their religion, as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court held (1) the appellate court erred in questioning whether the parents' beliefs were founded upon religious principles, (2) although the educational standards were facially neutral, they unduly burdened the parents' free exercise rights because they interfered with the school's ability to devote time to the teaching of religious subjects and they required &quot;all activities&quot; of a nonpublic school, including religious activities, to conform to the policies adopted by the board of education, and (3) the standards effectively eradicated the distinction between public and nonpublic education and thereby infringed on the parents' right under U.S Const. amend. XIV to direct the upbringing and education of their children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and ordered that the parents be discharged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1974, appellant, James Robert Hunt, was indicted by a grand jury for aggravated murder.  Appellant is a deaf-mute and, although capable of communicating rudimentarily by universal sign and finger language, is functionally illiterate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant entered a plea of not guilty and was committed by the Court of Common Pleas to Lima State Hospital for a determination of his mental condition and competency to stand trial.  Subsequently, appellant was transferred to Columbus State Hospital for a more thorough examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the competency hearing in August 1974, the court found that appellant was unable to stand trial and that he was not sane.  Therefore, the court ordered that he be committed to Lima State Hospital until restored to reason or for a period of two years, whichever occurs first.  Additionally, the order directed the authorities at Lima to transfer appellant to an institution or school where his communicative skills could be enlarged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's appeal of the order was dismissed by the Court of Appeals on the basis that no final appealable order had been entered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant appealed the order of the Court of Appeals for Ross County (Ohio), which dismissed his appeal of the trial court's order that he be committed to the state mental hospital until restored to reason or for a period of two years, whichever was less. The appellate court determined that the trial court order was not a final appealable order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant, a deaf-mute with limited communication skills, was indicted on a charge of aggravated murder. He entered a plea of not guilty, and the trial court committed him to the state mental hospital for evaluation. At the close of the competency hearing the trial court found he was incompetent to stand trial and ordered him committed for two years unless he returned to reason prior to the expiration of the two-year period. The appellate court dismissed his appeal because there was no final order. The court held that the trial court's commitment order was not a final order. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.381 provided the necessary safeguards for review of a commitment order. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting a two-year limit on the length of the commitment period. The trial court was under an obligation to prevent the violation of defendant's due process rights by avoiding an unconstitutional indefinite period of commitment, even though it was not statutorily empowered to place limits on the period of commitment. The court did not answer whether a trial court had the authority to set durational limits on confinement under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.38.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, George Robinson, Jr., was charged with aggravated murder in connection with the shooting death of his nephew, Ronald R. Robinson (hereinafter called &quot;the deceased&quot;), on June 29, 1974.  The case was tried to a jury in the Court of Common Pleas on January 27, 1975.  There were eight witnesses for the state, eight for the defendant, and three rebuttal witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's first witness, Dr. Emery Van Hamm, testified that the deceased died from a gunshot wound to the head; that the deceased was intoxicated at the time of his death; and that the alcohol's effects were increased by amphetamines.  The doctor testified further that the deceased was a large, muscular man about six feet tall, who weighed an estimated 200 pounds.  The state's next witness, Detective Dennis Canada, testified concerning his investigation at the scene of the incident, the defendant's home, 227 North Eureka Avenue, Columbus, Ohio.  He described state exhibits consisting of pictures of a holster on an upstairs bed, the living room wherein the shooting occurred, and the position of the deceased's body as he found it.  Mr. Hermann Motter and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his son David were doing cement work on the porch of defendant's house when the shooting occurred.  They testified that the deceased drove a Mustang automobile to the front of the house, parked his car, walked into the defendant's house with a beer bottle in his hand, and later came out and sat on the porch.  Both workers stated that they did not pay much attention to the situation, as ordinarily they ignored people who were drinking.  However, they testified that subsequently they heard someone say, &quot;If you don't get out of here, I'll shoot you.&quot; Officer David Morris testified that the inventory of the deceased's pockets disclosed no weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Bruce Morgan described the scene as it appeared in his investigation.  He volunteered the information that when he arrived the defendant was in the kitchen &quot;brushing his teeth.  I think the purpose of that was maybe to get the odor of alcohol from his breath.&quot; This comment precipitated a motion for a mistrial, which was overruled.  The court admonished the officer to answer the questions as asked, and directed the jury to disregard the gratuitous testimony as being totally unresponsive.  Officer Morgan then testified that the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said he had shot his nephew for fear of his life.  Officer Donald Corbin also summarized his part in the investigation.  Mrs. Elizabeth Robinson, the deceased's widow, said that her husband did not come home from his night shift at Buckeye Steel on June 29, 1974.  She conceded that the deceased took &quot;nerve pills&quot; and drank alcohol.  She also testified that she was aware defendant owned a gun.  The state's final witness, Richard C. Fisher, criminologist for the city of Columbus, stated that the weapon used in the shooting would not discharge automatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon motion of counsel for defendant at the close of the state's case, the trial court reduced the charge against defendant from aggravated murder to murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's case included seven witnesses, in addition to his own testimony.  There was evidence that defendant and the deceased had a disagreement some time prior to the shooting.  Further, the record indicates the deceased had said he was going to &quot;get him [the defendant] one way or another.&quot; Charles Siders, a neighbor, testified that just before the shooting he heard a car stop, with tires squealing and gravel flying; and that he saw a man with a beer bottle get out, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  go to defendant's house, and enter.  The defendant, his wife, and Vernon Burnett, stated that they were in the basement when they heard someone upstairs.  Mrs. Robinson went up to see who it was.  The deceased descended the stairs into the basement, and there was an altercation between him and the defendant.  There is some conflict as to what actually happened, but the two men went upstairs.  The defendant then went up to the second floor to get his gun and came down the stairs to the ground floor.  It was there the shooting occurred.  The defendant called the police.  Carl Robinson, a cousin of the deceased, testified concerning a time when he and the deceased engaged in a fight and the deceased apparently used a knife on him.  Don Vest, who worked for the defendant, testified concerning an incident when he, the defendant, and the deceased were out drinking together, at which time the deceased became angry and pushed him into a brick wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state, as noted above, called three rebuttal witnesses.  Two police officers indicated that the information given by Mrs. George Robinson and Mr. Burnett the day of the shooting was somewhat different from their trial testimony.  Further, Mrs. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ronald Robinson, the decedent's wife, gave a different version of an incident when she, the defendant, and his wife were allegedly threatened by the deceased with a butcher knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved for acquittal, and was overruled.  Counsel for defendant objected to several parts of the court's charge.  After the jury retired, it requested the court to repeat the charge.  The court refused to repeat the entire charge, but charged upon voluntary manslaughter and self-defense.  Counsel for defendant reiterated his previous objections.  Subsequently, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and judgment was entered upon the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals, setting out four assignments of error.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and sustained three of the assignments of error, which related to the trial court's instructions to the jury.  The court overruled the fourth, which claimed error in the failure to grant a mistrial after the unresponsive answer of Officer Morgan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">On appeal from defendant's conviction of voluntary manslaughter, the court of appeals reversed, and sustained three of the assignments of error, which related to the trial court's instructions to the jury. The State appealed and the court granted review. The first issue was whether the trial court committed prejudicial error by instructing the jury that defendant bore the burden of proving his affirmative defense of self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The court affirmed the reversal of defendant's conviction. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A), the State had the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt through the trial, and the burden did not shift to defendant. The court agreed with the court of appeals that the charge to the jury was erroneous in imposing upon defendant the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that that error was prejudicial. Defendant admitted that he killed the deceased; the sole issues in the case were those of mitigation and justification.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Stanley Waller, was charged on October 12, 1974, in the Hamilton County Municipal Court with a misdemeanor offense of having a deadly weapon, to wit, a knife, concealed upon his person in violation of R.

On December 9, 1974, the state of Ohio filed a notice of appeal in the trial court stating therein: &quot;This appeal is taken pursuant to Rule 12(J), Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure.&quot; The notice of appeal contained the requisite certifications required in the first paragraph of Rule 12(J).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The issue before the court was the constitutionality of Ohio R. Crim.

P. 12(J) appeals, were applicable in criminal appeals by the state. The court held that the requirements delineated in Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(J) of certification by the prosecuting attorney, the seven-day time limitation, diligent prosecution, and the recognizance provision were matters of procedure in implementation of the limited statutory right of appeal and properly promulgated under the constitutional grant of rule authority to the court. The court held that these were valid procedural requirements to which the prosecution was required to adhere. The court held that inasmuch as the State had perfected its appeal solely upon reliance on Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(J), and failed to obtain leave to appeal from the court of appeals, the judgment of the court of appeals, dismissing the appeal, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of June 15, 1974, patrolman Eugene Depue received a radio message that there was an intoxicated person in an automobile on Walnut Street in the city of Cincinnati, appellant herein.  After locating the vehicle and asking the occupant, appellee Edward Kelley, to step out, Officer Depue observed that Mr. Kelley was in an intoxicated condition.  Kelley was then arrested and charged with being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of Section 506-1 of the Cincinnati Municipal Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee entered a plea of not guilty and waived his right to a jury trial.  At the trial, Officer Depue testified that when he arrived on the scene, the automobile was legally parked; that appellee was seated in the driver's seat with his hands on the steering wheel and the keys in the ignition; and that the engine was not running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to appellee, he had driven downtown early in the morning, while completely sober, and lawfully parked on Walnut Street.  After drinking at a bar, he realized he was in no condition to drive and, sometime between 12:00 P. M. and 1:00 P. M., went&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  back to his car and lay down on the front seat.  He stated he did not leave the car until about 3:00 P. M., at which time he called his wife and requested her to come and get him.  Kelley testified further that when he returned to the car he again lay down upon the front seat and that he was arrested shortly thereafter.  Additionally, it was uncontroverted that the driver's seat belt, which had to have been in use in order for the engine to be started, was not fastened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, appellee was found guilty as charged.  The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, finding that the &quot;actual physical control&quot; aspect of the ordinance must relate to operation of a vehicle and, in the case before it, the factor of operation was absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 506-1. The cause was before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">A police officer found the driver in an intoxicated state in the driver's seat of his car with his hands on the steering wheel and the keys in the ignition. However, the engine was not running and the driver's seat belt, which had to be in use in order for the engine to be started, was not fastened. The appellate court found that the &quot;actual physical control&quot; aspect of the ordinance related to the operation of a vehicle and the factor of operation was absent. Reversing the appellate court's decision, the court ruled that the driver was in &quot;actual physical control&quot; of his vehicle, within the meaning of the ordinance. The court reasoned that the term &quot;actual physical control&quot; was required to relate, in a reasonable manner, to the prevention of the operation of vehicles by intoxicated persons. The record supported a conclusion that the driver was under the influence of alcohol and was in actual physical control of the vehicle at the time of his arrest. The court rejected the driver's argument that the ordinance was unconstitutional, holding that no conflict existed between the ordinance and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, which excluded physical control as a possible statutory offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, which reversed a trial court's entry of the driver's conviction for being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marvin Bruno, appellee herein, was charged in a two-count indictment returned by the Lake County grand jury with the offenses of endangering children proscribed by R.

On April 25, 1975, the trial court sustained the motion.  On May 8, 1975, appellant filed with the Court of Appeals a document characterized by that court as a &quot;Petition for Permission to File Bill of Exception.&quot; The bill of exceptions, which had been previously filed with the trial court, was attached to the petition as an exhibit.  On May 27, 1975, the Court of Appeals, by entry, granted permission to file the bill of exceptions.  The bill of exceptions was thereafter filed, followed by briefs.  On August 28, 1975, appellee moved to dismiss the appeal.  The Court of Appeals, without passing upon the merits of the appeal and treating the petition as a motion for leave to appeal, dismissed the appeal for the reason that appellant had not filed a notice of appeal concurrently with its motion for leave to appeal, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  citing as authority </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Wallace</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant was charged in a two-count indictment with the offenses of endangering children pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The pivotal issue in the appeal was whether the requirement in a recent case that appeals by the State shall be governed by the procedural requirements of Ohio R.

App. P. 5 governed appeals by the State from only those orders and judgments which become final after July 2, 1975. Since the judgment of dismissal by the court of appeals rested upon an application of such rules to an appeal from an order entered prior to July 2, 1975, and the appeal was otherwise properly perfected pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.67 through 2945.70, the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. Because the holding applied only prospectively, it was error to dismiss the appeal for failure to file a notice of appeal, as none was required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armour &amp; Co. (hereinafter Armour) is a foreign corporation doing business in the state of Ohio.  That business consists primarily of the manufacture and sale of food and dairy products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an audit of Armour's records, the Tax Commissioner of Ohio issued franchise tax arrearage certificates for the return years 1966-1968, and a franchise tax assessment for 1969, based upon his assignment of an Ohio situs to a portion of Armour's investments in subsidiary corporations, and his consequent increase in the &quot;property&quot; fraction of Armour's franchise tax formula.  R. C. 5733.05.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the audit period here in question, Armour owned shares in a number of other corporations, including all the shares of Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton, Armour Agricultural Chemical Co., and Armour Industrial Product Co.; and 81.6 percent of the shares of Armour-Dial Inc.  A portion of the physical property of each of those corporations is located in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armour perfected a timely appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, objecting to the Ohio situs assigned its investments, and contending that the Ohio situs was unconstitutional as applied to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The numerator of the factor defined by &sect; 5733.05 was determined by the value of property owned or used by the company in Ohio. The dispute concerned the situs of intangibles, consisting of shares of stock of the taxpayer's subsidiary corporations. On appeal, the court held that (1) the intangibles were to be valued in accordance with the value of physical property in and out of the state under &sect; 5733.05, without regard to guidelines in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5709.02 and .03; (2) the rule applied to the subsidiaries after a spin-off, just as it did before the spin-off; (3) cases cited by the taxpayer to support arguments of unconstitutionality were not applicable because the tax imposed by the commissioner was not a tax on intangibles, but upon a reasonable approximation of the value of the taxpayer's corporate franchise in Ohio, and it bore a real and reasonable relation to the privilege granted or to the protection of the state's interests; and (4) the equal protection clause was not violated because the allocation of the taxpayer's interest in the subsidiaries was based upon a true distinction, was not patently arbitrary, and was reasonably related to a legislative interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves charges of kidnapping, extortion and aggravated murder.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Morris Sorin, was hired by appellant, Board of Education of Warrensville Heights School District, by resolution adopted May 20, 1968, to serve as superintendent of the Warrensville Heights School District.  The parties entered into a three-year contract to effectuate the purpose of the aforesaid resolution, which by its terms commenced August 1, 1968, and was to expire July 31, 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sometime during the second year of this contractual period the parties began to experience certain differences of opinion.  These difficulties resulted in three members of the appellant, board of education, on March 9, 1970, asking appellee to tender his resignation.  On March 16, 1970, appellee complied with this request, but due to the parties' failure to agree upon the effective date of said resignation, appellee subsequently withdrew his tender of resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereupon, the appellant drafted numerous charges against appellee, and suspended him effective March 23, 1970, pending final determination of the aforesaid charges.  Pursuant to the provisions of R. C. 3319.16, as it existed at that time, appellee demanded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a public hearing before the board of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 23, 1970, the hearing commenced, and continued almost daily for five months.  On September 28, 1970, upon consideration of the record consisting of over 11,000 pages of testimony and 367 physical exhibits, the board of education, by a vote of three to two, terminated appellee's contract retroactive to March 23, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1970, appellee filed a petition of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County pursuant to R. C. 3319.16.  On March 13, 1974, the Court of Common Pleas issued a memorandum of opinion reversing the decision of the board of education.  In its opinion, the court held that appellee had been denied due process of law in the proceedings before the board of education because the members of the board of education comprising the tribunal before whom the charges were heard were biased and prejudiced, and because the charges filed against appellee were &quot;vague, general, not specific and therefore not in compliance with the statute.&quot; Accordingly, the court entered judgment for the appellee &quot;for the full salary and contract benefits for the period of suspension less any funds earned by him during&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said period in the like or similar capacity in the educational field and costs.&quot; The court also held that appellee should recover his attorney fees &quot;as proper costs of these proceedings based upon a hearing to be held in which appropriate evidence is to be submitted for reasonable fees by plaintiff's [appellee's] counsel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 4, 1974, the court held an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining the reasonable value of the services rendered by appellee's counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 19, 1974, the Court of Common Pleas entered its judgment, in which appellee was awarded the sum of $ 17,279.83, representing salary and contract benefits less deductible earnings for the period of suspension, and the sum of $ 62,867.13, representing &quot;reasonable attorney fees and costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 6, 1975, appellant filed its notice of appeal to this court in the Court of Appeals.  In its notice of appeal, appellant sought to appeal only that part of the decisions below awarding attorney fees to appellee.  On September 18, 1975, this court granted appellant's motion to certify as so limited. </SPAN></P>

The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.16 did not provide statutory authorization for the recovery of attorney fees in the superintendent's case.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 1973, the city of Cincinnati enacted two ordinances modifying and amending its building code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinance No. 556-1973, Section CC-3-47.03, provided, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the city of Cincinnati desires to preserve quality in its housing inventory; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, in most of the city, existing housing is only inspected on a complaint basis; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the city of Cincinnati desires to protect its citizens from housing which is a threat to their health and safety; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the city of Cincinnati desires to provide more effective information to prospective housing purchasers * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. CC-3-47.03.  Certificate of Housing Inspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) Every owner of improved real property intended for use as residential housing, prior to entering into a contract for the sale of that property, shall tender to the prospective buyer and obtain from the prospective buyer his signed acknowledgment of the receipt of a copy of a Certificate of Housing Inspection, issued by the Director of Buildings and Inspections on the subject property within 180 days of the entering into the contract for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(C) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Director of Buildings and Inspections shall issue a Certificate of Housing Inspections within fourteen (14) days after gaining access to all structures upon the realty and when:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) The owner or his authorized agent applies in writing to the director, agrees to a time during the working hours of the Department of Building and Inspections during which the subject property will be available for inspection, and pays to the City Treasurer the following fees: * * *.</SPAN></P>

The buyer shall be presumed not to have knowledge of any deficiencies unless:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) The buyer signs a written statement which specifically notes each deficiency, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) The buyer derives a substantial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  portion of his income from the business of real estate operations or is otherwise actively engaged in the business of real estate operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any action to enforce the provisions of the warranty imposed by this section shall be brought within two years of the time of the entering into the contract for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(F) Any person, being the owner or agent of improved realty subject to the provisions of this section, who fails to tender a Certificate of Housing Inspection to a prospective buyer in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be subject to penalty as provided in Section CC-3-64 COBC.  The absence of deficiencies in the subject property or the buyer's actual knowledge of any deficiencies shall not be a defense to the failure to tender a Certificate of Housing Inspection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinance No. 557-1973, stated, in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * any person who violates any of the provisions of Section CC-3-47.03(F) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a penalty of a fine of not less than $ 5.00 nor more than $ 500.00.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the Cincinnati Board of Realtors, Inc., and Chester J. Wilson filed an action for declaratory judgment in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court of Common Pleas, asserting that the ordinances were unconstitutional and invalid, and seeking an injunction against their enforcement.  Appellant and cross-appellee herein, Vivian E. Wilson, was then added as a plaintiff by an amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After dismissing the Cincinnati Board of Realtors and Chester Wilson for lack of standing, the court held that the ordinances were unconstitutional and enjoined the city from acting under their provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals found that Ordinance No. 556-1973 was a valid exercise of the city's police power in that it bore an adequate relationship to the public health, safety and general welfare.  However, the court determined that subsection (F) and Ordinance No. 557-1973 in its entirety were contrary to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; that the presumption within subsection (D), and the two exceptions thereto, were arbitrary and unreasonable; and, that the two year limitation of action established by subsection (D) was in conflict with state law and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

Both parties sought review pursuant to a motion to certify the record. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, finding that the enactment of the ordinance was not an exercise of the powers of local self-government. The court determined that the coercion represented by the sole alternative of possible criminal prosecution negated any consent, which could have been inferred from the allowance of a building inspection, and therefore the validity of such searches upon the basis of consent was not sustainable. The court found that the provisions of 557-1973(F) could not be constitutionally enforced.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject of this cause is a custody dispute over George Bryan Boyer, Jr., who turned eight years old in March 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to going on the road with a carnival in 1968, George's parents, Sandra L. Boyer, appellant herein, and George Bryan Boyer, Sr., appellee herein, left George with his paternal grandparents when he was a few months old.  George has continually resided with his grandparents since that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 17, 1973, after his mother had made several demands for his return, the grandparents filed a petition in the Probate Court of Fairfield County to adopt George.  That petition was dismissed by operation of R. C. 3107.06(B), which requires the consent of each parent who has not wilfully failed to properly support and maintain the child.  The Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment on November 8, 1974.  The court determined that the grandparents had voluntarily assumed the obligation to support George, that the mother was not guilty of wilful failure to support George, and that, therefore, the petition would be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the pendency of the adoption proceeding, the Court of Common Pleas of Licking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County on July 16, 1974, granted an uncontested divorce to appellant, and reserved the matter of George's custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The custody hearing commenced on December 13, 1974.  Appellee urged that custody be granted to the grandparents, and appellant requested that she be granted custody.  Appellant testified that she was not employed, that she had not sought employment, that she was receiving aid to dependent children payments, and would support George on an increase in such payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen witnesses and over 200 pages of transcript provided a thorough inquiry into the life-styles and home environments of the proposed custodians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court issued an oral order, which reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it in the best interest of the child * * * to award the custody to neither of the parents, but to award the custody of this child to Esther Boyer [the grandmother], with reasonable visitation to Sandra L. Boyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not making a finding that either party is unfit to have the custody of this child, I am saying that it is for the best interest of this child to make this order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, pursuant to Civ. R. 52, which found, inter alia: (1) that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;neither parent [is] unfit,&quot; (2) &quot;that the child has resided with his paternal grandparents since infancy, and they are suitable and willing to care for the grandchild,&quot; (3) &quot;that it would be for the best interest of said child to be awarded to the paternal grandmother, Esther C. Boyer,&quot; (4) &quot;that the child's interactions and interrelationship with the paternal grandparents has been excellent and to the child's best interest,&quot; (5) that &quot;the child's adjustment to the paternal grandparents home and community has been excellent,&quot; and (6) that &quot;the child's mental and physical health and the paternal grandparents mental and physical health is excellent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court concluded that under R. C. 3109.04, as amended September 30, 1974, an award of custody to a nonparent could be made in the absence of finding both parents unfit, and that it was in the best interest of George for custody to be awarded to his grandmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, and this court allowed a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1972, the city of Martins Ferry enacted Ordinance No. 6234, which stated, in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All vehicles using alleys, streets and highways of the city of Martins Ferry shall, when hauling dirt, coal, ashes, fly ash, gravel, sand, rubbish, garbage, or anything else of an unsightly or unsanitary nature, which can fall or be blown from said vehicle on to the alleys, streets, highways, sidewalks and property adjacent thereto in the city of Martins Ferry, must cover said vehicle with a tarpaulin or other cover which shall prevent any dust, dirt, coal, ashes, fly ash, gravel, sand, rubbish, garbage, or anything else of an unsightly or unsanitary nature, or any material from being dropped or being blown from said vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees are primarily engaged in the business of transporting coal.  Subsequent to the passage of the ordinance, a number of drivers of trucks owned or operated by appellees were arrested for failing to comply with its provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, appellees filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Belmont County, seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional and requesting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a permanent injunction against its further enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court upheld the validity of the ordinance and found it to be neither in conflict with the general laws of the state nor discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

XVIII, &sect; 3. Municipalities had the authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary, and other similar regulations, as were not in conflict with general laws. On review the court held that the trucker's argument could not be sustained. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.06 was not part of the general laws and did not provide a basis upon which a conflict could be asserted. The court noted that in determining whether an ordinance was in conflict with general laws, the test was whether the ordinance permitted or licensed that which the statute forbade and prohibited, and vice versa. The primary purpose of the legislation was to keep public roads and adjacent areas free from debris. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.31 did so my mandating that each vehicle be properly constructed so as to prevent spillage.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allan Dvorak, appellant, was appointed to the position of fireman in the Athens Fire Department by letter dated March 29, 1973, posted by the mayor of that city.  The letter opened with the language:</SPAN></P>

The Clerk of the Senate did not present the bills to the presiding officer of the Senate, who was available, for his signature, but instead presented the bills directly to the Governor for his signature.  Governor Gilligan signed each bill and had the signed laws delivered to the Secretary of State to be filed.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Sun Finance &amp; Loan Company (hereinafter referred to as Sun), is an Ohio corporation primarily engaged in the sales and consumer finance business in Ohio.  Sun operates its finance business through hundreds of offices located in approximately ten states, including Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun is the parent corporation, with numerous subsidiary corporations wholly owned by it, and operated as separate corporate divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For each of the tax years pertinent to this appeal (1967-1971), a number of Sun's subsidiaries were either incorporated in, or qualified to do business in, Ohio, while others were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon business done during the calendar years 1966 through 1970, inclusive, Sun filed consolidated dealer-in-intangibles returns in the taxable years 1967 through 1971, inclusive.  In computing the tax base applicable to such consolidated returns, Sun totaled the net worth of all its Ohio subsidiaries and the net worth of all out-of-state subsidiaries controlled by it, regardless of whether such out-of-state subsidiaries operated offices within Ohio or were incorporated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon audit, the Tax Commissioner recomputed certain assessments, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrived at total corrected net worth figures for the years involved herein, which corrected figures were accepted by Sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 22, 1972, Sun filed an application for a refund based upon the March 28, 1972, decision of the Board of Tax Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Midland Guardian Company </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Kosydar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, B. T. A. No. 71-01-0224.  This refund application pertained to the tax years 1967 to 1970, inclusive.  Subsequently, Sun filed a second refund application pertaining to tax year 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Commissioner denied both refund applications, whereupon Sun filed notices of appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals on June 26, 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The causes were consolidated for hearing before the Board of Tax Appeals.  On January 7, 1975, the board upheld Sun's claim for refund of a portion of the dealer-in-intangbles tax paid by Sun during the tax years 1967 to 1971, inclusive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellant Ohio Tax Commissioner sought review of the decision by the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which upheld appellee taxpayer's application for a refund of a portion of the dealer-in-intangibles tax paid by it for four tax years. The Commissioner alleged that the taxpayer's business done by its out-of-state finance subsidiaries that did not operate in Ohio should not be included in the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5725.15 apportionment formula.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The taxpayer was a Ohio corporation engaged in the sale of consumer financing. It operated its business in 10 states, including Ohio. The taxpayer was the parent corporation, with numerous subsidiary corporations wholly owned by it under it. The subsidiaries were operated as separate corporate divisions. Some of the subsidiaries were qualified to do business in Ohio, while others were not. When calculating its net worth for all its subsidiaries for dealer-in-intangibles tax returns, the taxpayer included the net worth of all its Ohio subsidiaries and all the out-of-state subsidiaries controlled by it. It then applied for a refund for the inclusion of the out-of-state income. The tax appeals court granted the application. The court reversed that decision and held that the out-of-state subsidiaries should not be included in the apportionment formula in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5725.15 because in order to qualify as a dealer in intangibles, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5725.01(B) required that the taxpayer's subsidiaries have an office or other place of business within Ohio. Because the taxpayer chose to operate its business in this manner, its out-of-state subsidiaries were not &quot;dealers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the decision of the tax appeals court granting the taxpayer a refund on a portion of the dealer-in-intangibles taxes paid by it for four years and denying the Commission's claim for payment of taxes by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This consolidated appeal challenges the validity of the transfers of 15 parcels of land to the Columbus and Upper Arlington school districts pursuant to R. C. 3311.06.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receiving the transfer requests, the State Board of Education referred the matter to a referee for hearings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The realty company replatted its undeveloped lots and planned to build duplexes on them. The residents, who owned single-family homes near the undeveloped lots, applied for a zoning change to restrict construction of the undeveloped lots to single-family homes. The trustees amended the area's zoning and prohibited duplexes. The realty company filed a declaratory action seeking to have the new zoning amendment declared unconstitutional. The trial court held in favor of the realty company. The residents sought review and argued that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12, the realty company failed to exhaust their administrative remedies regarding the zoning by failing to seek a referendum to change the new zoning change, and that it was erroneous to declare the zoning amendment unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 519.12 provided for the trustees' decision to become law unless it was challenged in court, that there was no duty imposed on the realty company to seek a referendum, that duplexes had been permitted for over 20 years in that area, and that the realty company's lots were the only lots where duplexes were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant was required to establish self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence thus impermissibly shifting the burden of proof, in giving partial and confusing instructions in response to jury questions, and in allowing the State to withhold a witness's out-of-court statements.</SPAN></P>

The victim left soon after the police arrived but returned later in the day and threatened to stab himself and defendant's sister. Defendant picked up a shotgun and fired two shots into the victim. At the time defendant entered the room, his sister had disarmed the victim. Defendant was convicted of murder. Defendant contended he acted in defense of another person. In affirming the conviction on appeal, the court held that: (1) defendant's position that he acted in defense of another did not negate the &quot;purposely&quot; element of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2903.02(A), and thus the imposition upon defendant of the burden of going forward with the evidence of the defense was proper; (2) defendant failed properly to preserve his objection to the trial court's response to a jury question; and (3) because the sister, who was scheduled as a prosecution witness, was not a co-defendant, the trial court did not err in refusing to compel discovery of her prior statements and grand jury testimony.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12, and carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12. The trial court overruled the pretrial motions to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to suppress because the police did not have reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop and frisk of defendant. The court determined that the officers had probable cause to believe a crime was in progress, and their belief was a justifiable inference from their observations and their experiences. There was no constitutional right to carry concealed weapons. The legislative classification under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(2) prohibiting a person under indictment for any felony of violence from knowingly carrying a firearm did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The municipal court suspended defendant's mandatory 10-day prison sentence after finding that Cleveland, Ohio, Municipal Ordinance &sect; 619.09(B) violated the separation of powers doctrine, the right to trial by jury, and the right to due process, and imposed cruel and unusual punishment. The court reversed, upholding the ordinance's constitutionality against all defendant's challenges. The ordinance did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because it was the role of the legislature, and not the judicial branch, to determine sentence lengths. Thus, the city council had the power to establish mandatory sentencing for solicitation. Defendant's right to a jury trial was not violated by a prosecutor's alleged practice of allowing defendants to choose to plead guilty to a violation of the ordinance instead of the state statute. Defendant's due process rights were not violated because the ordinance bore a rational relationship to the legitimate city interest of promoting safety and public health. Finally, the sentence imposed was not cruel and unusual. The cause was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The nursing home provided skilled nursing services to Medicaid patients and sought to compel the director to adjust its payments for the years 1974 through 1976. On review, the court sustained the nursing home's seven assignments of error, finding that ODPW at the time was without statutory authority to impose an additional requirement that construction costs for various categories were to exceed specified terms because Am. Sub. H.B. 221, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) was not yet effective. Similarly, ODPW was without authority to impose ceilings on several line items of the cost reports because Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5101:3-3-20 was not yet in effect. Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5101:3-3-22 was unreasonable because the nursing home would be required to pay increased payroll taxes in the report year but would not be reimbursed on the prospective rate until 1978. Even if ODPW's prospective rate method of reimbursement was a reasonable interpretation, such interpretation was not established as a rule pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 119.03 and 119.04. Because no statutory authority existed and no rules were lawfully promulgated, ODPW could not lawfully initiate a prospective system of payments.</SPAN></P>

The trial court agreed with appellee father that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18, only he could institute an application for legitimization. The mother claimed that the trial court's ruling violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The mother, who was not married to the father, filed an application for legitimization of her child. The trial court dismissed the action, finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18 allowed only the natural father of a child to institute the proceeding. On appeal, the court found that the appeal did not center on the constitutionality of the concept of legitimacy; rather, the question was whether or not the legislature intended to abolish illegitimacy by enacting &sect; 2105.18. The court concluded that the intent of the legislature in enacting &sect; 2105.18 was to permit, not command, fathers to legitimize their illegitimate children. The court reasoned that &sect; 2105.18 stated that the natural father of a child could file an application for legitimacy, and concluded that the legislature obviously did not intend to involuntarily commit someone to the legal relationship of father-child; hence the wording &quot;may&quot; in the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The arresting officer obtained a urine sample from defendant. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in admitting the urinalysis test. On appeal, the court held that a presumption existed that the urinalysis was valid, and that the trial court did not err in admitting the test result. The court noted that defendant did not object to the trial court's instructions concerning such presumption. The court stated that since the trial court admitted all other evidence except the use of the term &quot;usual individual,&quot; defendant's assignment of error was otherwise moot. Further, the court ruled that the fact that the officer did not refrigerate the urine sample went to the weight of the test result as evidence and not the result's admissibility. The court indicated that there was no sign that the assistant prosecutor acted with any intent to influence the jury when he moved to the lectern. The court concluded that the trial court's instruction on &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; was correct, and that the trial court did not err by refusing to allow defense counsel to use the word &quot;intoxicated&quot; in connection with the charge against defendant pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Plaintiffs, a building contractor, its owner, and an association of builders and contractors, appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio), which, in plaintiffs' action against defendant Director of the Ohio Department of Industrial Relations challenging the constitutionality of a state prevailing wage law, granted the Director's motion for summary judgment on the ground of plaintiffs' lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The contractor was a member of the association and a non-union employer that paid its workers based on a wage scale lower than that set forth in the state prevailing wage law. The contractor was required under such law to utilize a higher wage scale in computing its bid for a public project, which was then awarded to a lower bidder. Plaintiffs brought an action against the Director for a declaration that the law was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the Director's motion to dismiss for lack of standing, and plaintiffs appealed. The court found that because the association and the contractor sought to enjoin performance of the public contract, they were entitled to seek additional relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.09, including an injunction to prevent the contract's execution; thus, if the wage law was held unconstitutional, plaintiffs might be entitled to such relief. The court thus held that the association and the contractor had standing. Because the owner believed that the contract was in contravention of constitutional law, he had standing as a taxpayer under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 309.12, 309.13 and was not required to meet the common law tests for standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court reversed the order dismissing plaintiff's action and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant met with another person twice and stated that he would be willing to pay someone to beat up a third party. At the time of the second meeting, the other person was working in conjunction with the sheriff's department. Defendant provided the other person with photographs of the third party and other relevant information, and defendant made a partial payment. After the other person confirmed that defendant was armed during that second meeting, a deputy sheriff stopped defendant's vehicle and took him into custody. Defendant confirmed that he was armed and indicated where the weapon was located. On appeal, defendant claimed the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence because his arrest was unlawful and unconstitutional. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss the count of the indictment that charged him with attempted felonious assault or complicity in an attempted felonious assault. The appellate court held (1) that defendant's arrest was not unlawful, and (2) that defendant's conduct went beyond mere acts of preparation and included acts that were a substantial step towards the commission of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">On appeal the taxpayer argued that the additional assessment resulted from an unconstitutional retroactive application of a tax auditor's bulletin. The taxpayer manufactured and fabricated steel products. A tax auditor bulletin was issued and the taxpayer was assessed a deficiency on its tax return. The court held that the Ohio Supreme Court had previously approved retroactive application of federal decisions for pre-1976 imports. The court further held that the application of the bulletin to the taxpayer's return was constitutional. There was no application of a statutory amendment or new enactment. The bulletin was merely an instructional or informational notice of the impact of an Ohio Supreme Court case on personal property taxation under already existing Ohio statutes. The taxpayer's sole disadvantage from retroactive application was the loss of a special tax immunity but the court noted that the loss of a special preference was not a sufficient hardship to prevent retroactive application. Finally, the court concluded that the bulletin was not an invalid regulation.</SPAN></P>

The testimony demonstrated that defendant worked in the store and did sell the material to the officer. Defendant also testified that he was aware of the nature of the material in which the store traded. In addition, the trial court did not have to permit evidence of contemporary community standards. The only instance related to such standards was defendant's knowledge of the availability of cable television service in the area of the bookstore. Such information was not probative of the community standards.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Defendant was convicted of aggravated trafficking for selling lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, concluding that the mandatory sentencing range provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(6) did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The Eighth Amendment prohibited punishment that was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. There was a reasonable basis for the legislature to segregate drug trafficking from other third degree felonies and the comparative gravity of criminal offenses and their injurious consequences were matters for the state to determine. Testimony presented by the State that defendant offered to sell 100 &quot;hits&quot; of LSD to an undercover police officer and accepted payment that was later found in his possession was sufficient to sustain the jury's guilty verdict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Relator clerk of courts sought a writ of mandamus compelling respondent city council to reinstate the reductions effected by them in her 1982 budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The clerk alleged that she had requested, by way of an estimated budget, reasonable and necessary monies for the operation of her office during 1982. The city council, by passage of an ordinance, enacted a quarterly budget rather than an annual or half-year budget. By way of said ordinance, the council reduced the clerk's estimated budget. The clerk requested that the court issue a writ of mandamus directing the council to reinstate the reductions effected by them in the budget of 1982. The court found that the financial shortage that existed was not of such proportion as to justify cuts in the clerk's budget so that the city could operate. If the council had granted the clerk's request, the operation of the city departments would not be impeded. The court further found that the council arbitrarily reduced the clerk's budget. The court held that the clerk was entitled to receive the salaries that she had requested. However, the court held that, as to equipment and supplies, the clerk was not entitled to an unquestioned appropriation of all money requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">The court granted the clerk relief in part by ordering the council to appropriate the money for the salaries that the clerk had requested in her budget. The remainder of the clerk's prayer for mandamus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Appellants, a general contractor and a business, challenged a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit (Ohio), which ordered the general contractor and the business to submit window plans for a grocery store to appellee village in accordance with a local ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c14">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Hudson, OH, Ordinance &sect; 1428.01 provided that no person could construct or alter any building or structure in the municipality, when the cost exceeded $ 50 or where the effect of the construction or alteration was to enlarge or affect the bearing walls of any building without having first secured a permit. The general contractor of a store changed the glass windows to windows made of solid materials without receiving the approval of the building inspector. The village filed a complaint against the business and the general contractor to restrain the business from occupying the building until the village issued a necessary building permit and certificate of occupancy. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in finding that the installation of stone aggregate panels had to be approved by the village's architectural and historic board of review; (2) the board of review could approve the plans without a hearing; and (3) the village's ordinances were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
