</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fathers sought review of a decision of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky), holding that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406.031, which established a four-year statute of limitations in paternity actions pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406.021(1), was unconstitutional as failing to afford equal protection to illegitimate children. Appellee commonwealth had appealed on behalf of a mother, and the circuit court had consolidated 153 appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prior version of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406.031 provided for a three-year limitations period. However, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that the three-year period failed to afford equal protection to illegitimate children and was therefore unconstitutional. The state court had based its decision on prior United States Supreme Court cases, which held that similar limitations periods did not provide illegitimate children with an adequate opportunity to obtain support and did not substantially relate to the state's interest in avoiding litigation of stale or fraudulent claims. The Kentucky General Assembly then adopted a four-year statute of limitations. The court, adopting the circuit court's opinion, held that the four-year period was also unconstitutional. The possible difficulties of proof did not overcome the concrete human rights of illegitimate children. Because invalidation of &sect; 406.031 left Kentucky without a statute of limitations in paternity actions, the five-year time limit set out in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.120(2) applied. The five-year time limit did not run during the minority of any person entitled to bring an action pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406.021(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's decision and adopted its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant family care home operator sought review of a judgment from the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which upheld the assessment of civil penalties against the operator by appellee cabinet for human resources for the violation of agency regulations and the violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 216.557.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator contended that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 216.537 et seq., which authorized the cabinet to exercise judicial power, violated the Kentucky Constitution. Specifically, the operator argued that the statutes violated Ky. Const. &sect; 109 in which the judicial powers of the Commonwealth were vested solely in the courts. The court affirmed the judgment, finding the statutes constitutional. The court concluded that the mere fact that the cabinet was involved in an adjudication did not in itself render the statutes unconstitutional as a usurpation of judicial power. The court found that the combination of statutory guidelines as to prohibited conduct, availability of a due process hearing, and provisions for judicial review served to circumscribe the cabinet's area of discretion within constitutional limits. The court also found that the legislature did not unconstitutionally delegate power. Additionally, the court found no error in the trial court's ruling that the penalty was supported by substantial evidence. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court had the authority to impose an equitable lien to insure the payment of the penalty assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth sought review of the judgments of the Campbell Circuit Court (Kentucky), the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky), and the Laurel Circuit Court (Kentucky). One circuit court held that the district court had no power to order placement of appellee children committed to appellant Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR). Two circuit courts affirmed contempt orders against CHR.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After one child was committed as a delinquent to CHR's custody, CHR appealed the placement order, and the circuit court ruled that the district court had no power under Ky.

After two children were committed to the care of CHR in separate proceedings and CHR failed to pick up the children, the circuit courts affirmed a district court order holding CHR in civil contempt and awarding damages. The Commonwealth sought review of the circuit court judgments. On appeal, the court held that, to the extent that the district courts issued placement orders to CHR, those orders were unconstitutional and void under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28. The court found, however, that this rule did not apply where the district court ordered placement with a designated date of pick-up of the child. The court ruled that the district courts had both express and implied authority to enforce valid orders to CHR through contempt proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment affirming a contempt order against CHR.

The court reversed the circuit court's order that refused to prohibit the district court from enforcing its orders to CHR by contempt proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to defendant, in that the police officers and not the legislature were the ones who determined what constituted drug paraphernalia. The court noted that &sect; 218A.510 set out 14 factors that were to be considered in determining whether an item constituted drug paraphernalia and that the State offered evidence only as to one of the 14 factors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth contended that in the absence of a statute authorizing the assessment of guardian fees against the Commonwealth, the trial court lacked authority to award these fees under Ky.

In affirming the judgment, the court first dismissed the contention of the indigent parent's counsel that he was entitled to more than that which the trial court awarded him. The court held that counsel's fees were capped at $ 300 by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.603(9), even if counsel had to defend an appeal prosecuted by the Commonwealth. Turning back to the Commonwealth's argument, the court found statutory authority for the award of guardian fees in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 453.060(2) and Ky. R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and its firemen, sought reversal of the ruling of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted summary judgment to appellees, a gas station owner, the station operator, a station customer, and a gas pump manufacturer. The trial court held that the &quot;Fireman's Rule&quot; applied to all appellees in an action for injuries incurred by the firemen, who had responded when the customer drove into a gas pump and started a fire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On this appeal, the court considered the applicability of the &quot;Fireman's Rule&quot; (rule), which stated the owner or occupant was not liable for having negligently created the condition necessitating a fireman's presence (that is, the fire itself), but might be liable for failure to warn of unusual or hidden hazards, for actively negligent conduct and, in some jurisdictions, for statutory violations. The court rejected constitutional arguments and held that it was bound by Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 1.030(8)(a) to follow precedent and to apply the rule to the owner and the operator of the gas station. The court considered whether to extend the rule to non-owners or non-occupiers of land such as the customer and the gas pump manufacturer. The court concluded that the rule was based on a public policy that recognized that most fires were caused by some form of negligence, that firemen often suffered fire-related injuries, and that encouraged persons to call fire departments without fear of liability or litigation. The court held that there was no logical reason why the protection should be limited to the owners and the occupants of land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that applied the Fireman's Rule to all appellees.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it was discriminatory and it bore no rational relation to the purpose for its enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an increase in the employee's federal black lung benefits payable under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq., brought his federal benefits to a level exceeding his state workers' compensation benefits, the Board reduced his state benefits pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.800. Appellants challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 342.800 because the shift under &sect; 342.800 from state to federal benefits had the ultimate effect of placing the burden of paying the entire benefit on the employer. The court affirmed the circuit court's order, which upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 342.800 and affirmed the Board's order reducing the employee's black lung benefits under that statute.&nbsp;Section 342.800 had the legitimate state objective of, among other things, preventing unjust enrichment of black lung claimants and double recovery under the state and federal entitlement programs. Because the objective was legitimate and the offset provision in &sect; 342.800 was a logical means to accomplish that end, the statute's classification scheme was not unconstitutionally arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city attempted to file a single action against individuals who were delinquent with respect to real property taxes under the Mass Foreclosure Act. The clerk refused to accept the lawsuit for filing, and the city sought to force the clerk to accept it. The trial court entered judgment for appellees after finding that the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 91.450-91.527 were unconstitutional and invalid. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the provision requiring notification of all interested parties complied with the minimum constitutional safeguards. However, the provision whereby the failure to provide notification did not invalidate any proceedings under the statute nullified the notification requirement and was clearly unconstitutional and valid. The court concluded that there was nothing in the record to overcome the presumption that the invalid portion of the statute could be severed, and the remaining portions of the statutes were constitutional. They did not constitute special legislation and they did not usurp the authority of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant indigent putative father sought discretionary review of an order of the Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky) affirming a paternity determination against the father, which had been initiated by appellee mother.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, as an AFDC recipient, was required to file a paternity action against the putative father, who was then determined to be the father. On appeal, the father argued that his due process and equal protection rights were violated by the trial court's refusal to order the county or the commonwealth to pay for HLA blood tests, and by the trial court's use of a &quot;preponderance of evidence&quot; burden of proof instead of a &quot;clear and convincing&quot; one. The court affirmed the preponderance of the evidence standard but reversed and remanded for a new trial. Applying a three step procedural due process analysis, the court held that the father's due process rights had been violated. The inability of the father to obtain the blood test at no expense to him illustrated the existence of a considerable risk of an erroneous determination. The court also found that in case of a criminal prosecution for nonsupport, the paternity determination could not have been challenged because of res judicata grounds. Because due process required at a minimum that the father had a meaningful opportunity to be heard, the father was entitled to a new trial with blood tests provided him at no cost.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 15.715(4), which provided that the Attorney General had the duty, within the 48th Judicial Circuit, to prosecute any person who received compensation from the Treasury, was violative of Ky. Const. &sect; 59. The Attorney General's authority was purely statutory, and of all the Commonwealth Attorneys, the Commonwealth Attorney of the 48th Judicial Circuit was deprived of the authority to prosecute violations of the criminal laws involving compensation from the Treasury. Every other Commonwealth Attorney was empowered to prosecute such violations where they occurred either within his jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellee truckers to challenge the Tarp Law, the trial court issued an injunction under Ky. R. Civ. P. 65 that purported to prohibit its enforcement throughout the Commonwealth. The current declaratory judgment was entered after a trooper without knowledge of the ban cited a trucker, and another court without knowledge convicted him. On appeal, the court examined the validity of the underlying injunction and held that an injunction was an equitable power that had to be exercised in a cautious and limited manner. The court rejected the concept that the nominal appearance of a few officials of the Commonwealth in the underlying action gave the trial court the power to enjoin the entire legislative and executive branches. The court held that the trial court only had in personam jurisdiction over the immediate parties before it and had no equitable power to prevent other courts from exercising their jurisdiction to hear cases involving the same statute with other parties. The court held that the underlying injunction was not effective as to persons not before the trial court so the declaratory judgment was likewise invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision and held that &sect; 413.135 violated the equal protection provisions of the Kentucky Constitution and the United States Constitution. The court found that the classification created by &sect; 413.135 was not rational in fact and that there was no rational basis to exclude materialmen, controlling owners, and tenants from the immunity granted to architects, engineers, and builders by &sect; 413.135. The court noted that suppliers assumed the exact risks of the protected class, yet received no protection under &sect; 413.135.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coal company alleged that it was denied a fair hearing because the hearing officer was not impartial. The company contended that the Department had no authority to assess civil penalties and that the civil penalty provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 350.990 were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that there was no error in the hearing officer's view. The court noted that the hearing officer made his finding on the evidence presented by the witnesses and merely stated that what he saw substantiated their testimony. The court ruled that the company was not denied a full and fair hearing by acts of the hearing officer. The court determined that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 350.130 provided that the performance bond would be forfeited upon an order of the Department to revoke the permit. Further, the court decided that the Department had the authority to assess civil penalties pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. chs. 224, 350. The court concluded that Ky. Rev. Stat.

The corporation filed a notice of pooling affecting appellees' land. The cardinal issue related to the validity of and compliance with a &quot;pooling&quot; clause contained in the leases prepared on the oil and gas lease form. The court reversed the judgment. The court determined that before voluntary, private pooling could have been brought into practical reality, the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 353.630 and 353.640 did not have to be complied with. The court held that such provisions did not apply to voluntary proceedings where it could have only been done in furtherance of conservation. The court explained that Kentucky law did not provide that geological data was the sine qua non of establishing a conservation purpose. The court noted that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 353.570(3) was not vague or uncertain. The court concluded that the authorization to commence drilling was neither arbitrary nor contravened either the statutory or lease requirement of conservation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue with merit was whether part of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.730(1)(b) was constitutional. The part of &sect; 342.730(1)(b) in question provided that benefits shall not have been paid after an employee became eligible for normal old age benefits under the federal Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Act. The claimants contended that the phrase was so vague and ambiguous as to violate their due process and equal protection rights. The court held that the provision was constitutional and affirmed the trial court's judgment as modified. The modification indicated that the claimant's were to have received full benefits until they became 65 and started drawing or receiving social security benefits. The first claimant contended that the ex parte medical records that were attached to the application form required by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.316(2)(b)(1) had evidentiary value and should have been given weight by the Board even though the doctors never testified in the case. The court held that once the claim of the first claimant became contested and evidence was introduced, the ex parte reports as such had no probative value. Thus, the Board was not required to consider them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual, a former employee of the city for some 13 years, sought early retirement based upon &quot;occupational disability&quot; as a result of an alleged injury suffered at work on December 2, 1981. The Board denied her retirement pension benefits based upon occupational disability, but approved pension benefits based upon non-occupational disability. As a result, the individual's appeal to the circuit court was precipitated. The circuit court took judicial notice of the individual's workers' compensation proceeding then in progress. In addition, the circuit court permitted her to supplement the circuit court record with depositions taken in her compensation case, and rendered findings of fact and conclusions. Thereafter, the circuit court entered judgment that the individual suffered an occupational disability and was entitled to retirement pension benefits as such. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that Covington, Ky., Commissioners' Ordinance 0-39-64, in no way conflicted with Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court found that immunity not only applied to speech and debate, but to voting, reporting, and every act in the execution of their legislative duties.

When she refused to pay her back-rent, the landlord filed an eviction action and the district court found the tenant guilty of forcible detainer. The court reversed the circuit court's order that affirmed the district court decision because confusion arose due to enactment of the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. The court found that the new Act was amended so that it only applied to Fayette County and Jefferson County. Further, the court found that the new Act repealed the old statutes that governed the other 118 Kentucky counties. The court held that when the Act was held unconstitutional as special legislation in contravention to Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 59 and 60, the old laws were no longer considered repealed. Rather, the court held that the effect of the invalid law was to leave the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the unconstitutional law. In reversing, the court held that Ky. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was the widow of a former city police officer and, as such, she received pension benefits from the board until her remarriage in 1978. When the remarriage was dissolved by divorce three months later, the claimant sought reinstatement of benefits, which the board denied. In ruling on the claimant's petition for a declaratory judgment to determine her right to receive such benefits, the court awarded unpaid accrued pension benefits plus interest. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, contrary to the board's contention, the claimant met the definition of a &quot;widow&quot; under &sect; 95.624(3)(c), and the statute required the resumption of benefits to a surviving spouse of a qualified former employee upon the termination of that surviving spouse's remarriage. Further, the fact that the statute permanently terminated pension benefits of remarried widows in third class cities but allowed them to resume in second class cities did not constitute discrimination against widows in second class cities because the differential treatment of remarriage as having different consequences for widows in cities of separate classes had little constitutional impact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the Board and the trial court failed to apply appropriate rules of statutory construction to determine legislative intent expressed in the sales and use tax statutes and the Board failed to consider the issues of its denial of due process and equal protection and of discriminatory taxation. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which denied injunctive relief, because there was no error in the trial court's determination that the company would not have suffered any immediate or irreparable harm. The court found no unfairness or illegality in imposing a uniform sales tax on fuel and food purchased in Kentucky by the company because there was no unreasonable burden on interstate commerce and no double taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heirs alleged that they were served by constructive service of process under Ky. R. Civ.

They argued that they were indispensable parties because they had an interest in the real estate that was the subject matter of the action. They argued that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 454.210, the long-arm statute, was the proper tool for obtaining jurisdiction over nonresidents. Upon review, the court found that the action was not an in personam action that required the long-arm statute, but an in rem action for which service under Ky. R. Civ. P. 4.04 was sufficient. The court determined that personal jurisdiction over indispensable parties was not absent resulting in an adjudication void for a defect in subject matter jurisdiction. The court observed that the heirs failed to serve the attorney general with their challenge to the constitutionality of the quiet title statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been charged with homicide. Defendant was an indigent person who was being represented by an appointed attorney. Subsequently, the trial court judge ordered the fiscal court to pay the fees of a psychologist and a ballistics expert for their services as expert witnesses for defendant. After the fiscal court informed the trial court judge that it had not budgeted any funds to pay such fees, the trial court judge issued an order that set aside the homicide trial and excluded the death penalty as a possible penalty. The Commonwealth sought a writ of prohibition. The court granted the writ of prohibition because it did not find any authority to support the action of the trial court judge in excluding, before the trial, the death penalty as a possible penalty due to the fiscal court's inability to pay the fees of two expert witnesses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Workers' Compensation Board awarded the employee benefits, the circuit court affirmed, and the employer appealed. The court held that the employee did not voluntarily reject workers' compensation coverage within the meaning of Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court determined that &sect; 342.395 was not void for vagueness even though there was no set standard under &sect; 342.395 defining what would constitute a voluntary rejection. The court found that &sect; 342.395 did not violate Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 24A.340 from the standpoint of an infringement upon the rule making power of the Kentucky Supreme Court granted through Ky.

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court noted that the small claims division did not originate from the judicial amendment to the state constitution. Instead the small claims division was created by an act of the legislature in order to provide a special summary procedure for the adjudication of small claims. The court also noted that it assumed that the Kentucky Supreme Court was aware of &sect; 24A.340 when it amended Rule 73.02(1)(a) because it had already determined that Rule 73.02(1)(a) was inapplicable where there was a statute creating a special remedy. The court held that the small claims division was validly enacted by the legislature and that legislature had the power to implement or even abolish that which it created. Therefore the court held that &sect; 24A.340 was a valid enactment as to appeals from the small claims division.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that even though &sect; 344.450 provided somewhat broader relief than the federal statutes in that it allowed claims for humiliation and personal indignity, which the federal statutes did not allow, such a claim could not be maintained where an EEOC charge was still pending. Once the EEOC charge was resolved, the state action could proceed. The court noted that if the former employees wanted to bring claim in federal court, the claims for humiliation and indignity could be maintained as pendent state claims. The court held that the filing of a grievance under the former employees' union contract did not prevent the state claim because simultaneous pursuit of those rights was not restricted by Ky. Rev.

The court found that appellants failed to file any exceptions to the appraised amount within the time permitted by the applicable statutes. Because of this they were barred from seeking an increase over the amount which was fixed by the commissioner's report and appraisal. Because appellants failed to follow the statutory procedures for excepting to the award, the case was closed as to them. The court determined that appellants accepted the commissioner's award and that they received what to them was &quot;just compensation.&quot; Furthermore, appellants were obviously aware of the pending litigation and condemnation of their property as evidenced by their visit with an attorney, and therefore were responsible for following the appropriate procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority proposed to build scattered-site, low-income housing, and the property owners objected. The trial court granted the Authority's motion for summary judgment, holding that it was not required to submit its plans to the Commission for approval because the projects were not public structures or public facilities within the meaning of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 80.110. The trial court also unnecessarily determined that a portion of the statute was unconstitutional as being special or local legislation. The court affirmed the determination that the projects were not within the statutory meaning of public structures or public facilities, but made no determination as to the constitutionality of the statute. The use of the building, rather than its public or private ownership, was the relevant factor in determining the necessary involvement by the planning commission. Based on the omission of housing from the statute, the legislature did not see the need to require the involvement of the Commission as long as the scattered-site, single-family, low-income projects complied with the existing zoning regulations, comprehensive plans and building regulations.</SPAN></P>

The method of determining who would work the overtime was based on a voluntary, rotational system. The employee joined a church whose Sabbath extended from sundown Friday until sundown of Saturday. For a period of months, the employee was successful in finding someone to cover his shift. When he could not find a replacement for four Saturdays in September and October and he failed to come to work, he was fired. The commission found the employer had violated Ky. Rev. Stat.&sect;344.040, ordered the employee reinstated, and ordered the employer to accommodate the employee's need to be absent on Saturdays. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that: (1) the commission did not base its conclusion upon a proper determination of the existing law as applied to the facts found by the commission; (2) the employer was not required to discriminate against some employees in order to enable others to observe their Sabbath; and (3) the morale problems created on account of the employer's attempts to accommodate the employee constituted legal &quot;undue hardship.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill in question was entitled &quot;An Act Relating to Alcoholic Beverage Control.&quot; It was intended to permit the sale of certain alcoholic beverages in certain areas on Sunday. An amendment to the bill concerned the manner of calculating and paying minimum wages. The trial court held that the amendment violated Ky. Const. &sect; 51 because it related to more than one subject and the subject was not expressed in the title of the bill. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was correct. The court stated that there was no relation between the title, which pertained to alcoholic beverages, and its contents, which pertained to minimum wages. The court concluded that the subject of alcoholic beverages was clearly beyond the general idea of a bill pertaining to the subject of minimum wages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were divorced and the husband was required to pay maintenance and child support. He later moved for reduction of the payments required and the matter was referred to the Commissioner, who did not file his recommendations until 263 days later. The Commissioner recommended denial of the motion for reduction and the trial court accepted his report. The husband's objections to the report were overruled and he asked for reconsideration, which was denied. The husband sought review, arguing that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.350(2) precluded the Commissioner from filing his recommendations more than 90 days after the conclusion of the hearing. The court reviewed the statute, noting that it imposed a time limit for filing reports and judgments and provided that a judicial officer who violated the statute was subject to removal. The court concluded that a report or judgment tardily filed was not void, and that a litigant's remedy was to seek a mandatory writ to compel its issuance. The court chastised the husband for compounding the delay by doing nothing until it appeared that the report was adverse to him, and only then raising the applicability of &sect; 454.350(2).</SPAN></P>

The Board of Elections mistakenly calculated the time limit within which the petition was to be filed, and concluded that it was untimely. The taxpayers brought an action in the trial court for review of that decision. The trial court dismissed their suit. On appeal, the court found that the Board of Elections had clearly erred when it failed to apply the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 446.030(1)(a) in computing the time limit. However, the court held that the taxpayers' remedy under Ky. Rev.

Further, the court held that the taxpayers had no right to raise a constitutional due process issue on appeal that was not raised below. The court also held that it was not an abuse of discretion under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23A.010(4) to deny the taxpayers a review of the decision by the Board of Elections.</SPAN></P>

The commission asserted that it acted properly under the Airport Zoning Act, which operated under the police powers so that the regulation did not constitute a taking of property. The court reversed the determination that the Airport Zoning Act was unconstitutional because it constituted a lawful exercise of the power to regulate under the police powers, but affirmed the remainder of the decision that the commission had to comply with the guidelines set out in the Airport Zoning Act, and it could not enforce the orders against the power company without paying the power company just compensation.</SPAN></P>

Th trial court upheld the statutes, finding that they bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose of providing for the respectable and orderly disposition of cadavers. The court affirmed. It was not an unreasonable exercise of the police power to require that each funeral home be personally conducted by a licensed undertaker. Although it was possible that the funeral director might have been able to give full and complete attention to the conduct of the business of both establishments, the business was replete with possibilities for the evasion of the licensing provisions or conduct thereunder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, medical professionals from various counties, were indicted for theft by deception and related offenses. In appealing defendants' transfers of venue, the Commonwealth argued that the doctrine of forum non conveniens only applied in civil cases. One defendant argued that the Commonwealth's appeal should be dismissed because the orders appealed from were interlocutory. The court reversed the orders and directed the entry of orders denying transfer from the venue of the trial court. The court noted that under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 452.210, the trial court could transfer venue in a criminal proceeding only if defendant could not receive a fair trial. The court also noted that under &sect; 452.630, the prosecution could proceed in the county in which defendant was first arrested where venue existed in two or more counties. Because venue was proper in the trial court and the trial court had no authority to transfer venue, the court concluded that the transfers were improper. The court determined that the Commonwealth had the right appeal from the interlocutory orders under &sect; 22A.202(4).</SPAN></P>

The court found that the resulting disorders were a characteristic of the creation of debtor-creditor relationships among inmates.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the city and the owners appealed, contending that summary judgment was premature. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that there were no genuine issue of material fact presented by the owners and that the city was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The preamble to the ordinance was not an essential part thereof and could not be used to test its constitutionality. The legislators had the prerogative of determining public policy for their constituents and the wisdom of their decision was not subject to the court's judgment. The court held that the ordinance did not arbitrarily or discriminatorily place the owners in an improper classification because the ordinance did not pertain to pornography or regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages, but only regulated adult entertainment facilities. There was no violation of the equal protection clause because there was a rational basis for the differentiation between the owners' signs and those of bars that were not adult entertainment facilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An insurer brought an indemnification action against a tortfeasor who caused an injury for which the insurer was liable. The trial court held that the insurer had no indemnification rights against the tortfeasor independent of its subrogation rights pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304.39-070. The court affirmed this decision and noted that the Motor Vehicle reparations Act explicitly limited the recovery of a reparations obligor to the statutorily proscribed methods. Although the insurer asserted that the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act unconstitutionally abolished its common law indemnity rights, the court held that no common law indemnity had ever arisen in this matter because the dispute did not involve joint tortfeasors. Common law indemnity arose among joint tortfeasors where one was primarily liable and the other was secondarily liable. The court noted that the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act was constitutional and declared that an insurer who did business in-state impliedly consented to be bound by that state's statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies were providers of alarm and security systems that utilized the services of the telephone company. The companies objected to the telephone company's application for an increase in intrastate rates and charges. The companies moved for the dismissal of the rate increases on the ground that the telephone company had embarked on sizable construction projects without first applying for and receiving from the utility commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The costs of those projects were to be considered in determining an appropriate rate increase. The utility commission overruled the motion to dismiss the application for the rate increases. The trial court affirmed that decision. On appeal, the court found that the companies had not shown that the trial court's order was unreasonable or unlawful by clear and satisfactory evidence. The court found that it should avoid rule making or legislating where the statutes at issue were not unconstitutional and the utility commission had not usurped the authority granted by statute to establish its own rules and guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased died intestate. He was divorced and had three children. The posthumous illegitimate child was born seven months after the death of the deceased. The court affirmed, determining that a posthumous illegitimate child's paternity did not have to be established during his father's lifetime before he may be adjudged entitled to inherit. Thus, the illegitimate child could establish his paternity after his father's death and share in the estate. The court found that the potential for spurious claims justified a requirement that a posthumous illegitimate child must prove his paternity by clear and convincing evidence. It was error for the trial court to exclude testimony of a witness because the deceased's acknowledgment of paternity to the witness was a statement against the deceased's pecuniary and proprietary interest. The court determined that the trial court was unwilling to accord the testimony of the various witnesses the weight and credibility necessary for it to find the evidence of paternity was clear and convincing. The court would not reverse the decision because the trial court's decision was not clearly erroneous or amounted to a clear abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed for divorce in a county where he had resided for less than six months.

The husband challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 452.470, arguing that it discriminated against men in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Ky. Const. &sect; 2. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that &sect; 452.470 was unconstitutional. There was no reason to give a resident wife the home court advantage in divorce actions because women no longer needed the protection that they did in the past. There was no legitimate state interest in requiring the husband to travel to the county of his wife's residence before he could seek a divorce nor was there an interest in giving the wife the power to choose the forum by changing her residence. A divorce action could be brought in the county where either party usually resided.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant university challenged a declaratory judgment in which the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) upheld the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 164.939 et seq. and found that employees who shared in clinically generated income were agents of the university and that providing them with malpractice insurance was a matter of public concern not violative of Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university contended that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 164.939 et seq. violated Ky. Const. &sect; 50 because it created a contingent liability against future general revenues. The creation of the excess coverage fund did not obligate future general funds. That mechanism did not prevent future generations from exercising their discretion in making appropriations. The statutes did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 177. The university also contended that employees who shared in clinically generated income were not agents of the university as defined in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 164.940(3). The court did not agree. Because the purpose of clinical activity was to further the goals of the university and not to establish a means whereby private practice was established, the activity could be classified as special circumstances under &sect; 164.940(3). Even if the provision of insurance could be considered an emolument, it was being provided for public services within the purview of Ky. Const. &sect; 3. Because the prime reason for the clinical activity was the achievement of the public purpose goals of the medical center, the legislation did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 171.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.070(2) and therefore was not includible in determining the corporation license tax to be paid by the company in favor of appellee Kentucky Department of Revenue (department).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company used an accelerated method to compute depreciation for tax purposes, but used a straight-line method for purposes of its financial statements. To reconcile the difference, the company's financial statements carried a deferred federal income tax account. The tax board ruled that the money representing the difference between what the taxes were under one depreciation method versus the other method was not taxable. The trial court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that &sect; 136.070(2) did not provide the method by which to compute the value of a company's capital for computation of the license tax. The court determined that the common and approved meaning of the word &quot;surplus&quot; was the excess of the net assets of a corporation over the par or stated value of its corporate stock. The court concluded that the amounts in the account from year to year represented a surplus and fell within the statutory definition of capital. The court reasoned that the method of depreciation used by the taxpayer in computing its federal income tax did not control the method by which depreciation expenses were to be computed for state license tax purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members of the courthouse commission alleged that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 68.480 was unconstitutional special legislation.&nbsp;Section 68.480 provided that a county's fiscal court was allowed to impose a tax on property located within a courthouse district that exceeded the tax imposed on property in other parts of the county. The trial court had upheld the statute, but the court reversed. The court ruled that the state legislature could expand the taxing authority of the fiscal court. However, the court held that &sect; 68.480 indicated that the expanded authority was to be exercised only against that portion of the county that had comprised the courthouse district rather than against the county as a whole. The court ruled that the fiscal court did not have the entitlement that the courthouse commission did to create a disparate tax burden between the district and the remainder of the county. Ky. Const. &sect; 171 required that taxes be uniform upon all property subject to taxation within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The presiding judge at the track issued a ruling that the consolation race was not required. A copy of the ruling was delivered to the horse's groom, but the owner never received the copy. Therefore, the owner did not file an appeal to the Kentucky Harness Racing Commission (commission) within 10 days as provided in 811 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:105, &sect; 1. The final pacing event was held and the entire purse, including the consolation prize money, was distributed to the winners of the main event. The court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The court determined that the commission did not have the authority or jurisdiction to determine the consolation race issue and to grant the requested relief after the purse had already been distributed. Therefore, the court concluded that direct judicial relief was available without resorting to an appeal to the commission. The court remanded the action to the circuit court to determine whether the owner was denied due process and, if so, to consider the owner's breach of contract claim.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that there was no provision in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 109 that authorized the county to proceed unilaterally as it had attempted to do. The court found that the decision of the trial court was wrong insofar as it refused the cities the right conferred upon them by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 82.082(1), which supplanted Ky. Rev. Stat.

In one, industry No. 1 prevailed, and, in another, city No. 2 prevailed. The court found in favor of the industries. The cities argued that the industries' remedies were limited to remonstrance suits, but the court disagreed. The court held that an action based upon &sect; 81.280(2) was distinct from a remonstrance action because each arose from a separate set of circumstances. The validity of an annexation ordinance could be questioned independently of a remonstrance suit. The court further ruled that in the absence of an industry's consent as provided &sect; 81.280(3), an annexation had to comply with the conditions of &sect; 81.280(2). Because they did not comply with either &sect; 81.280(2) or &sect; 81.280(3), the ordinances were void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) that granted appellee summary judgment in appellant's action to recover punitive damages for injuries sustained by appellant's minor child and caused by appellee. Appellant contended that the trial court improperly found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304:39 (1977) barred appellant's claim, and that section 304:39 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the bicycle upon which appellant's minor child was a passenger was struck by appellee's car, appellant brought suit to recover for the child's injuries. The trial court, finding that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304:39 (1977) barred appellant's claim, granted appellee summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that section 304:39 was inapplicable. Specifically, the court ruled that because no section 304.39-020 rejection of the restrictions upon traditional tort liability and recovery was made on behalf of the child, under section 304.39-060(4) he was considered to have made an affirmative acceptance of the program, and thus unless the child was a &quot;non user&quot; within the meaning of the statute, section 304:39 barred recovery. Because appellant raised the issue of non user for the first time on appeal, the court ruled that he was estopped from arguing that a material issue of fact existed concerning that issue. The court ruled that with respect to the punitive damages claim for appellee's failure to render assistance, appellant failed to assert any claim on which actual damages could be awarded and was thus precluded from seeking exemplary damages.</SPAN></P>

However, it insisted that defendant had no &quot;standing&quot; to complain of the search and seizure. In support of their argument, the commonwealth pointed out that no one, other than the officers, were present at the time that the premises were searched. Defendant did not own the premises and there was no evidence that he was residing there. Moreover, the commonwealth contended that defendant claimed that he did not own the seized property. Defendant argued, nevertheless, that he had &quot;automatic standing&quot; to contest the search. On appeal, the held it could not resolve the issue of standing based on the facts in the record. Therefore, the court remanded that issue to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing. The court further held that that Ky. Rev.

The trial court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 247.780 was unconstitutional, but the trial court decided that &sect; 247.780 was severable from the remainder of the Act, which was valid. Both parties appealed the decision of the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 247.715(4) defined a producer as every person who produced burley tobacco and thereafter caused the same to be marketed. The court adopted the rationale and ruling of the trial court and decided that the trial court properly found that the Act was valid, except for &sect; 247.780.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two codefendants were indicted for armed robbery. The codefendants entered a plea of guilty to robbery in the second degree.

Subsequently, defendant was permitted to plead to the same reduced charged and, in open court, admitted that he committed the robbery while armed with a pistol. The trial court denied defendant probation under &sect; 533.060. Defendant contended that &sect; 533.060 was unconstitutional and that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the pistol was a weapon from which a shot or projectile could be discharged that is readily capable of producing death or other serious physical injury, as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 500.080(4)(a), the Kentucky &quot;deadly weapon&quot; statute. Affirming, the court held that &sect; 533.060 was constitutional. The court found that defendant's use of a gun in the commission of an armed robbery, in answer to a direct question by the trial court, was sufficient to bring his application for probation within the purview of Ky.

Appellants argued that the trial court erred in holding that the city did not have jurisdictional authority to rezone and that the zoning process was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city took action to both annex and rezone the landowner's property. A separate action challenged the annexation. The city passed its annexation ordinance a few days after the trial court judgment authorizing annexation and before a motion for new trial was filed. The court held that the motion did not stay proceedings until it was filed. The city had properly acted upon the authority of the judgment to annex the property. Its action was later validated by the affirming of that judgment on appeal. The city did, therefore, have jurisdictional authority to annex the property. The city acted to rezone the landowners' property at a meeting where no record was made. This was in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 100.167, which placed an affirmative duty on the commission to make and keep records. The court held that without a record, it and the circuit court were unable to perform their proper function of judicial review. This was a violation of the neighbors' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional because it was vague, overly-broad delegation of legislative authority, and a usurpation of judicial authority. The court reversed, applying the &quot;safeguards&quot; test to the administrative decision made by the commission. The court applied a five factor analysis to determine whether delegation by the state legislature to the commission was proper : (1) whether there were sufficient provisions to insure a defined scope of authority, (2) whether the delegation was to a newly created agency or to a long established agency, (3) whether significant decisions were left with the commission, (4) whether agency decisions affecting the rights of individuals were inherently reviewable, and (5) whether the delegation was necessary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The custodian injured his back in the performance of his job duties for the BOE. The Board found a temporary total disability. It also found a 25 percent permanent partial disability of which 10 percent or 2/5 of the total was due to a prior active condition and thus noncompensable. As for the remaining 15 percent, the Board apportioned 1/2 to the BOE on the basis that 3/10 of the total disability was attributable to the job-related injury and 1/2 to the Special Fund on the basis that 3/10 of the total disability was due to a pre-existing dormant condition. On appeal from the circuit court's affirmance, the court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.120(4) expressly required all compensation for the custodian's prior disabling disease or condition to be excluded from his award. To honor the mandate of &sect; 342.120(4) and a precedent of the Supreme Court of Kentucky, the court raised the custodian's award to the precedent's minimum and then calculated the appropriate proportionate reduction. Moreover, the court held that the Board miscalculated the custodian's temporary total disability benefits by applying the &quot;lost wages&quot; method rather than the formula set out in Ky. Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the proponents' application for incorporation of the city. The court held that the action by the trial court was a &quot;case&quot; as it involved findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment. The proceeding was a judicial function and an exercise of judicial power. The court further held that the opponents had the right to appeal under Ky. Const. &sect; 115. Lastly, the court reversed on the ground that the attempt to incorporate did not even remotely comply with the provisions of Ky. Const. &sect; 81.040 as the area sought to be incorporated was larger than that permitted by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Convington proposed annexation of portions of appellees' areas. Partial summary judgments against the City of Covington were entered by the trial court because the Act of February 16, 1968, ch. 5, 1968 Ky. Acts 5 reclassified the City of Edgewood from a sixth to a fourth-class city &quot;vitiated&quot; the City of Covington's annexation ordinance and prevented it from going forward with the proposed annexation, and that the effect of the 1978 amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.160 disallowed the City of Convington's annexation. The court held that because the City of Covington had begun to annex the territory under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.140 as if the areas were unincorporated it was entitled to proceed and to avoid the referendum provisions of the statutes governing annexation of the territory of another city. The court also found that the effect of the 1978 amendment of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.160 applied the referendum requirement of &sect; 81.160(1) to the annexation of territory which was incorporated and classified by the Legislature before January 1, 1978 although the annexation proceedings had begun before the territory was classified.

</DIV>

The Personnel Director sent the employee a letter informing her that she was suspended from her position for 30 days. The reason for the suspension was that she was a suspect in a theft investigation. The employee was notified that a pretermination hearing was set and that a warrant had been issued for her arrest. In lieu of her appearance at the hearing, her attorney sent a letter to the Personnel Director asking that the letter be considered an appeal of any actions of suspension or firing. The employee was terminated. The employee was acquitted of all criminal charges. The attorney then wrote the Commissioner of Personnel requesting a hearing, which was denied. The employee sued appellees seeking damages and reinstatement. The trial court dismissed the employee's complaint by a summary judgment. On review, the court affirmed. The attorney's correspondence was not directed to the Personnel Board, and did not set forth the specifics of the employee's argument. The employee failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.

The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees on grounds the claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations of the Kentucky Blue Sky Law. On appeal, the court affirmed. The Blue Sky Law applied to the offer or sale of a security. Because the payment was clearly made to obtain the insider's stock, the transaction involved a security. The classification of actions based on fraud into general actions, which had a five-year statute of limitations, and actions based on securities fraud, which had a three-year statute of limitations, was reasonable. Therefore, the shorter statute of limitations was constitutional. There was no saving statute under the Blue Sky Law permitting a minor to bring suit after the minor reached majority.</SPAN></P>

The court found the statute involved constitutional rights, the non-fundamental right to seek public office, and the fundamental rights to vote, to travel, and to associate for political beliefs. Because the statute had a real and appreciable impact on the voters and their choice of candidates, the court applied the compelling state interest test to determine its constitutionality. The court found opponents would make known their opposing candidate's shortcomings, and with today's mobile society, lengthy durational requirements violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

The boats are registered by the taxpayer as livery or boats for hire and were leased on a weekly basis. A petition of appeal was taken to the Board, which ruled that the houseboats were subject to use tax. The trial court affirmed the Board's order, and the taxpayer appealed. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and the Board. The houseboats of the taxpayer were exempt from sales and use tax under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.483, which contained no language excluding houseboats from the application of the exemption. The statute drew no distinction between industrial commercial craft and pleasure commercial craft, and the past practice of the Department was not to collect use tax on houseboats.

The trial court upheld the right of the Fund to collect the license tax from any corporation or partnership, which stated that it was in the business of holding real estate for rental income or investment. The principal question was whether the holding of rental property for income was a business. If so, the business was subject to the tax. The court found that renting real property was considered a business in most cases, but not all. Therefore, the 30 percent exemption was justified on administrative considerations alone. The failure to include partnerships in the exemption was not unconstitutional. The board of alderman did not improperly delegate authority to the Fund. Requiring businesses to divulge information regarding items subject to federal income tax was rationally related to the need for accurate information upon which to base the license fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sued appellees, a county property assessor, a sheriff, and the Kentucky Department of Revenue, to have certain tax assessments declared invalid on the grounds that they were made without proper notice. The Nicholas Circuit Court (Kentucky) entered a judgment declaring the assessments invalid and directing the Department to make emergency assessments. Both the owners and appellees sought review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Department informed her that the property values in the county were too low, the assessor undertook to reassess the residential property in the most seriously under-assessed areas to increase the total residential assessments and to equalize assessments within the county generally. The assessor made the increases and mailed notices of increased assessments only to property owners who had listed and valued their property in the assessor's office and to out-of-county residents. The only notice given to the other owners was by a two-week publication in a local newspaper. On appeal, the court held that though the assessor failed to give proper notice to some owners, the circuit court erred by voiding the assessments in their entirety. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.650, the only part of the assessment that should have been voided for lack of notice was the amount of the increase. Moreover, the owners who had appealed the increased assessments to the proper review board were not entitled to relief for lack of notice. The circuit court committed clear error in directing the Department to provide an emergency assessment because there was no showing that it had abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action for further proceedings. The court directed that on remand, the assessments for all unaffected properties were to be valued as previously assessed and that the assessments for all properties with increased assessments whose owners did not receive notice and who took no appeal were to be valued as assessed before the increase; the increase as to all other properties had to be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a husband and wife, filed suit against appellee driver to recover damages for injuries they sustained in an automobile accident with the driver. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) entered a judgment dismissing appellants' complaint on the grounds that they were precluded from maintaining a suit for common law negligence by the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 304.39-030 and 304.39-060. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>

The husband owned a car but had no automobile insurance policy in force because he could not afford to pay for it. The wife did not own a car and had no automobile insurance. She recently obtained a driver's license. She had not yet begun to drive, other than using the roads to learn how to drive and become licensed. The circuit court held that because appellants had not rejected the Act's limitations on their tort rights, they were bound by its provisions. Appellants argued that the Act imposed no limits on the wife's tort rights because she was not an automobile operator or user and was not a member of a household in which an operator had an insurance policy with basic reparations benefits coverage. On appeal, the court held that because the wife was a licensed driver and had used the roads while preparing for her license, she was an operator or user within the Act's terms. There was no merit to appellants' claim that they were being denied their tort rights due to their inability to pay for insurance. Appellants had the right to reject the Act's limitations on their tort rights but had not done so.</SPAN></P>

Admin. Regs. 20:070, &sect;5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board of Agriculture adopted 302 Ky. Admin. Regs. 20:070, which required brucellosis tests for all livestock at stockyards. The stockyards contended the regulation was unconstitutional on the ground that it constituted a taking of private property without just compensation, and was an unreasonable exercise of police power. The circuit court found the regulation to be clear and a valid and reasonable exercise of the state's police power. The court on appeal noted that the charge that the exertion of the police power deprived one of property without compensation was basically an assertion that the regulation violated Ky. Const. &sect; 2, which prohibited the exercise of absolute and arbitrary power. The court held that the regulation was reasonable because the evidence supported the fact that the program had worked in other states, and there was no evidence that any stockyard had been put out of business because of any economic burden from the enforcement of the testing program. The fact that the federal government was assisting such a program was some evidence of public necessity. The court found no reversible error in the circuit court judge's findings and conclusions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 121.045. The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) entered a judgment upholding the decision. The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator was an incumbent and sought reelection. The Registry, which was an independent state agency charged with enforcing the Corrupt Practices At, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 121.015 to 121.990, advised the candidates for the office of administrator that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 121.045 prohibited donations from anyone whose property might be assessed by an administrator. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 121.045 provided that no person other than a corporation was to contribute any money or thing of value towards the election of any county officer who, in his official capacity, was required to perform any duties peculiar to such person not common to the general public, or to control such person's affairs, or to perform any duty in assessing the property of such person for taxation. The purpose of &sect; 121.045 was to prohibit bribes, however, as applied to the administrators, the statute prohibited them from receiving donations from persons in the county in which they ran for office. Such a result was not only inconsistent with a candidate's right to solicit campaign funds, but was also an unreasonable classification in violation of the constitutional prohibition against special legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and declared unconstitutional so much of the statute as prohibited donations to the election campaigns of candidates for the office of property valuation administrator by persons whose property such candidates might assess.</SPAN></P>

The controversy began when appellee city, a second class city, passed an ordinance proposing to annex certain unincorporated territory in the county.

Appellant city filed an action in the circuit court in which it sought a declaration of the rights of the two cities to the territory. The circuit court entered judgments for appellee city in both suits. Before the mandates issued, the General Assembly enacted Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.145, which placed a restriction upon the annexation power of certain cities of the second class that were not placed upon the other cities within that class. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee city, holding that the circuit court correctly held that &sect; 81.145 plainly violated the Kentucky Constitution, which provided that all cities of the same class possessed the same powers and were subject to the same restrictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant fractured his leg in a fall, which leg had been struck by polio at an early age. The special fund argued that Ky. Rev.

Const. &sect;&sect; 2, 3, and 59 and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The employer argued in addition that the Board's finding that the claimant received an injury of appreciable proportions resulting in impairment of his future earning capacity was clearly erroneous based on the evidence. The court denied relief, affirming. The court found substantial evidence to support the finding that the claimant suffered a five- percent occupational disability to the body as a whole. The liability was properly apportioned between the fund and the employer. The court was aware that the legislature amended &sect; 342.740(1) to eliminate minimum weekly benefits for permanent partial disability, after it interpreted to allow them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant filed an application for a building permit to construct a building for a liquor store. The application was denied by the city building inspector and the applicant appealed to the zoning board, which upheld the denial. The trial court determined that certain zoning sections were unconstitutional, nullified the zoning provisions, and authorized the issuance of the applicant's permit. The court reversed. The court held that although the trial court was correct in determining that the ordinance was unconstitutional for failure to delineate standards by which the board of adjustment could approve exceptions to uses permitted in local business districts, the contention that the unconstitutional provision was void and is of no effect did not vitiate the remaining portions of the ordinance which contained a severability clause. The court ruled that to allow the issuance of a permit for a liquor store would be to completely disregard the remaining valid provisions of the ordinance because a liquor store was not listed as a permitted use. Moreover, an application for a retail liquor store did not qualify as a conditional use.</SPAN></P>

However, the court also held that an instruction on the lesser included offense, under Ky. Rev. Stat. 376.990(2), should have been given. The court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 376.070, 376.990(2) required a culpable mental state before a person could be guilty of even a misdemeanor. The court found that no criminal liability could be imposed on the contractor for failure to pay an amount which he disputed in good faith. Further, the court stated that to commit a felony under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 514.070, the contractor must not only have known that an amount was due and owing for labor and material, but must also have know that he had a legal obligation to make payment out of the proceeds he had received from the homeowner but had intentionally dealt with those proceeds as his own.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Kentucky challenged a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which dismissed an indictment filed against defendant. The indictment charged that defendant had committed third-degree forgery in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 516.040. Defendant asserted that the appeal should be dismissed because the Commonwealth did not follow the requirements of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A.020(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the food services director for a county school district. He allegedly misrepresented a financial arrangement offered by a milk supplier. He was indicted after the school district formed a bid tabulation based upon defendant's misrepresentation. The trial court dismissed the indictment and the Commonwealth appealed, asserting that it had sufficient evidence to prove defendant had furnished false and misleading information, both verbally and in writing. Defendant challenged the appeal, claiming that the attorney general had not given his prior approval as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A.020(4). In affirming, the court held that the promulgation of court procedure was left to the Kentucky Supreme Court. The legislature exceeded its authority in enacting &sect; 22A.020(4), which imposed a procedural requirement not found in the Criminal Rules of Procedure. Section 22A.020(4) was unconstitutional. Defendant could not be found guilty of forgery because forgery required the false making of a written instrument. Defendant's acts were verbal only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, six justices of the peace of Wayne County, Kentucky, filed a petition for writ of prohibition and declaratory judgment asking the Wayne Circuit Court (Kentucky) to prevent appellee county judge from enforcing an order reapportioning the justices' districts. Appellants challenged a decision that denied their petition and found jurisdiction for reapportionment in the county court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the application for reapportionment was filed, a county judge directed notices to be posted as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25.680. Appellants claimed an improper departure from the statutory procedure. The issue was whether the court would read &sect; 25.680 in such a way so as to void the reapportionment, which that the justices' lopsided districts in accordance with the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle. The court affirmed. The statutes covering reapportionment of justices' districts, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25.680, 25.690, and 25.700, were ambiguous. However, voiding the reapportionment would unnecessarily conflict with the Equal Protection Clause. Appellants had not shown that any technical departure from the statute placed them at a disadvantage. They had notice and an adequate opportunity to present their objections to the commissioners' report that recommended reapportionment. Meaningless technicalities would not thwart the Constitutional prohibition against substantial variations from equal population in drawing districts for units of local government having general governmental powers over the entire geographic area served by the body.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 11.42. Defendant was convicted of robbery. A timely notice of appeal was filed on behalf of defendant, but his appeal was dismissed because the record on appeal was not filed timely as required by Ky. R. Crim. P. 12.58. Defendant challenged his conviction by a motion under Ky. R. Crim. P. 12.58.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A court appointed attorney represented defendant. Following the conviction, defendant requested an appeal be taken on his behalf. Defendant's trial attorney testified there was a misunderstanding between the public defender office and the trial attorney as to who was to perfect the record on appeal. Defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of his trial counsel's failure to perfect his original appeal and to raise the issue of competency to stand trial. The court found that the question on appeal was whether defendant received &quot;reasonably competent counsel&quot; to assist in his appeal. The court held that a reasonably competent attorney could comply with the procedural requirements of Ky. R. Crim. P. 12.58. The court held that when, without excuse, the attorney failed to comply with Ky. R. Crim. P. 12.58, defendant had not received effective assistance of counsel on appeal. The court found that there was no testimony in the record to indicate defendant was incompetent to stand trial. The court held the trial court did not err in refusing to vacate the judgment because of the failure of trial counsel to raise the question of defendant's competency.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that time for filing the record on appeal was to run from the date of the appointment of appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Jessamine County Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted him, after a jury trial, of violation of the &quot;cold check&quot; statute,&nbsp;Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a part-time job selling handcrafted leather goods, and ordered a large quantity of leather ponchos from an importer. He paid with a check, and although the importer processed the check several times, and contacted defendant 18 times, the check was not made good, and the importer filed a complaint. Defendant was indicted, tried and convicted of the violation of &sect; 514.040. On appeal, defendant claimed that the rebuttable presumption contained in the statute that imputed knowledge and intent to deprive from a defendant's failure to make the check good within 10 days was irrational and arbitrary and violated the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court affirmed the conviction. There was a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, the presumed fact was more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it was made to depend, and the evidence necessary to invoke the inference was sufficient for a rational juror to find the inferred fact beyond a reasonable doubt. There was sufficient evidence that supported the conviction. The statute punished fraud, not debt.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner then filed a petition to require the owner to permit the inspection. On appeal of the dismissal of the Commissioner's action, the Commissioner contended that he and his agents had authority for such an inspection under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 338.101. In affirming, the court held that the owner was protected under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ky. Const. &sect; 10 against warrantless searches. In the absence of any showing that the owner's business was inherently dangerous or that it was subject to federal or state regulation and/or license, an inspection of the closed area of the premises was not permitted without a search warrant or court order obtained upon probable cause.

The embalmer obtained a temporary injunction against appellees. His application for a permanent injunction was denied, and the temporary injunction was dismissed. The embalmer alleged that the statute was vague because he was only able to guess at the meaning of normal function and regular service. In affirming, the court determined that the statute was not unconstitutional. The embalmer was well aware of what constituted normal functions and regular services of his profession. Moreover, a licensee's due process rights were protected if he was given a hearing that afforded him all of his constitutional rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's will left one half of his estate to his father and mother and the other half to his wife. At the time of the decedent's death he left surviving him his wife, two adopted daughters, his mother, and the illegitimate son. The son sought to inherit under the will. The trial court held that the son was not a lawful heir or issue of the decedent. On appeal, the court stated that the son was not capable of inheriting from his father or his father's kindred by reason of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 391.090(2), and was accordingly not permitted to take under the anti-lapse provision of either Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 394.400 or 395.410(1). The court had interpreted the word &quot;children&quot; to exclude illegitimate children unless a clear intention was expressed in the will. The son was excluded from taking under the decedent's will because the decedent did not intend the son to take. The will written seven years after the son's birth had to be considered to reflect the intention of the decedent. The evidence and the record failed to support the contention that the relationship between the decedent and the son's mother was an illegal or void marriage as provided in Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 391.100(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was arrested on an unspecified charge on November 19, 1974, and lodged in the county jail. He was subsequently convicted of the crime for which he was indicted and sentenced on September 26, 1975, to five years in the penitentiary. In the interim, he had served 317 days in the county jail. Upon his incarceration in the penitentiary, the trial court gave to the inmate the credit of 317 days on his maximum sentence, and the Bureau awarded him 230 days adjusted jail credit time, in accordance with the policies of the Bureau. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order, which dismissed his petition requesting a declaratory judgment that the Bureau be required to award &quot;good time&quot; credit for his pre-sentence custody. The court held that the case was brought in an improper manner. When a state prisoner challenged the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment and sought immediate or speedier release from imprisonment his sole federal remedy was a writ of habeas corpus which required that he exhaust effective available state remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher challenged a judgement of the Fulton Circuit Court (Kentucky), which dismissed his action against defendants, a board of education, the members of the board, and the superintendent of the school district, claiming that the school board wrongfully failed to renew his teaching contract for the next school year under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 161.750 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher agreed to teach five classes, including one designated as a planning period. The teacher was not eligible for a continuing contract under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 161.740, but was employed under a limited contract. Before the end of the school year, the teacher was verbally informed that his salary was to be reduced by the elimination of the planning period. The teacher responded that he was unable to accept reemployment unless he received the same pay. As such, the superintendent sent the teacher a letter that the district was unable to renew his contract because it had lost students and revenue. The teacher claimed that he was entitled to a hearing to prove the falsity of the reasons given in the superintendent's letter and that the board acted arbitrarily in failing to re-employ him. The court held that the board properly gave the teacher a statement of reasons for his non-reemployment under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 161.750 (1970), but that the teacher, who was non-tenured, did not have the right to contest the grounds given for his non-reemployment. The court further held that the teacher was not entitled to the protections of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 161.760.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual sought review of a decision from the trial court (Kentucky), which found that the individual was not a lawful heir or issue of his decedent father and dismissed the action. The Supreme Court of Kentucky transferred the case to the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were whether the individual was entitled to take, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 294.400 or 394.410(1), a share devised to his grandfather under the will of his father, whether the individual was a legitimate child by reason of &sect; 391.100(2), whether the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the trial court were supported by substantial evidence, and whether &sect; 391.090(2) was constitutional under the Kentucky and Federal Constitutions. The individual's grandfather had predeceased the individual's father. However, the will of the individual's father had left a share of his estate to the grandfather. The court held that there was no dispute that the individual was a natural child. However, the court held that the evidence indicated serious questions as to the actual occurrence of a marriage between the individual's father and mother. The court held that the individual was not capable of inheriting from his father or his father's kindred by reason of &sect; 391.090(2). The court further held that the individual was excluded from taking under his decedent father's will because the decedent did not intend the individual to take.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a decision from the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which entered judgment in favor of appellee, Kentucky Bureau of Corrections, and dismissed the inmate's action for a declaratory judgment requesting the Bureau be required to award good time credit for his pre-sentence custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought a declaratory judgment to require the Bureau to award good time credit for his pre-sentence custody. The Bureau filed a motion to dismiss. The action was dismissed. On appeal, the inmate asserted it was error to have dismissed his action on the ground that he was not entitled to good time credit and that the dismissal denied him his right to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court stated that it had to first determine whether or not the action was properly brought. Case law held that if an inmate brought an action challenging the fact or duration of his confinement then the remedy was a writ of habeas corpus. Where an inmate brought such action and sought damages then habeas corpus was not the appropriate or available remedy; a declaratory judgment action was proper. The court was of the opinion the action should have been dismissed because it was brought in an improper fashion, as the inmate did not seek damages but only release from his confinement. In the event a habeas corpus action was brought by the inmate the court felt that it had to set out proper guidelines and stated that the Bureau was the proper party in the action.</SPAN></P>
