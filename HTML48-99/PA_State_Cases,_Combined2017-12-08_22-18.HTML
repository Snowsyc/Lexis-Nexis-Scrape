</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed motions for a new trial and for arrest of judgment after the court convicted him of driving while his operating privileges were suspended, a violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(a), and imposed a fine and sentenced him to a three-month prison term pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6503.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while his operating privileges were suspended for DUI, a violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(b). The court convicted him of driving while under suspension, a violation of &sect; 1543(a), and sentenced him pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6503. Defendant filed motions for a new trial and for arrest of judgment, claiming that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(a) was not a lesser-included offense of &sect; 1543(b) and that the court erred in sentencing him under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6503. The court denied the motions, holding that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(a) was a lesser-included offense of &sect; 1543(b) because proof of the former offense necessarily involved proof of the latter. The court also ruled that defendant waived any objection to the method of proof of his prior driving convictions for purposes of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6503 by failing to object during sentencing and that the Commonwealth had no duty to establish the validity of the prior convictions because he did not claim that the convictions were unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 6503 did not deny defendant his right to due process by failing to set a time limit for the use of prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, persons liable to pay a hotel tax imposed by the Convention Center Authority Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 16201 et seq.&nbsp;(Act), filed a class action against defendants, Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority, City of Philadelphia, and the Department of Revenue of the City of Philadelphia, for a declaration that the Act violated the due process, equal protection, interstate commerce, and privileges and immunities clauses of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act increased the existing hotel tax in Philadelphia by adding two percentage points to the tax during the pendency of the construction of a convention center, and adding an additional one percentage point once the convention center was in operation. In finding for defendants, the court held that the tax did not violate the equal protection or due process clauses of the federal constitution, or the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania constitution, because the tax was reasonable in its object, the classifications it created were rational, and it was exacted in return for services provided by the state. The court next applied a four-part test and concluded that the tax did not violate the commerce clause, noting that the tax did not discriminate in favor of intrastate commerce and was fairly related to services provided by the state. Finally, the court held that the tax did not violate the privileges and immunities clause, because far from imposing a burden on interstate travel, the purpose of the tax was to promote tourism via the construction of the convention center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for defendants in plaintiff's action to have the hotel tax provision of Convention Center Authority Act declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of cruelty to animals, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first contended that the evidence was insufficient. The court found credible evidence that defendant engaged in cockfighting. He was observed by officers holding a rooster and forcing its head together with another rooster, a common action to bait the roosters to fight. There was a fighting pit in defendant's house and the roosters were dressed for fighting. Defendant also questioned the constitutionality of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511, claiming it was vague, overbroad, and that it called for a cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that, applied to the facts of the case and defendant's probationary sentence, defendant had no standing for the challenge. A specificity of a statute could only be measured against the conduct of the party challenging it. The statute clearly proscribed defendant's conduct. Defendant also claimed that a witness was not a qualified expert in the area of cockfighting, but the court held that his background in investigation of animal cruelty was reasonable for a special knowledge. The opinion testimony was properly admitted. Finally, the court confirmed that there were exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless search and arrest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence was denied. Defendant was subsequently convicted by the trial judge of cruelty to animals, in violation of 18 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5511(h.1), which made it a felony to permit animal fighting. Defendant was sentenced to one year non-reporting probation. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. Upon review, the court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. The court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied because there were exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless search and arrest. The court held that the direct evidence that cockfighting was in progress, and other evidence, was more than sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. The court held that the animal cruelty statute, as applied to defendant, was clear and not unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was charged with a crime and deposited cash bail to secure his release pending trial. Following plaintiff's conviction, his bail was revoked and the Clerk returned the amount deposited, less a poundage fee. In his action, plaintiff claimed that the Clerk was liable to plaintiff on either a breach of contract or constructive trust theory for the accrued interest. As to the Clerk's contention that he was immune from liability under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8541-8564, the court determined that the Act did not apply because plaintiff was not attempting to recover on a theory of tort. The court further ruled that that the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure allowed the Clerk to invest bail funds and pay the accrued interest to the county treasurer for deposit into the general fund, that the withholding of interest by the county was not unconstitutional taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as claimed by plaintiff, and that the Clerk was not obligated to pay the accrued interest over to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The former members' complaint did not aver any specific facts to substantiate the existence of an agency relationship. The individual corporations did not exercise such authority and control over each other that each was an agent of the other for due process purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition, under the Disease Prevention and Control Act of 1955, 35 Pa. Stat. &sect; 521.1 et seq., to compel defendant, who was accused of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, terroristic threats, and indecent assault to submit to a blood test to determine whether he possessed the virus for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome at the request of the victim who feared contracting the disease and transmitting it to her family.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the sexual assault that the victim sustained, the Commonwealth argued that bodily fluids, possibly containing the AIDS virus, were transmitted between the assailant and the victim. Further, the Commonwealth insisted that it would use the blood test for no other purpose than to alleviate the victim's fears. It promised to forego using any of the results against defendant in the future. However, defendant's counsel contended that the evidence sought had no probative value in the determination of defendant's guilt or innocence and that such a bodily intrusion was in and of itself contrary to U.S. Const. amend. IV. Moreover, the legislature's recent action in attempting to amend 35 Pa. Stat. &sect; 521.1 et seq. to include AIDS testing within the required testing of the Disease Prevention and Control Act of 1955 (Act) evinced its previous exclusion from the Act. Ruling that the blood test was a search and was required to pass the test of constitutionality, the court determined that the legislature's definition of venereal disease included the later-discovered AIDS disease. Since the legislature had so acted, the court was empowered to act. Thus, the court ordered the testing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered defendant to forthwith undergo an examination under the statute for a venereal disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff partnership asked the court to enter a declaratory judgment that the Convention Center Authority Act (act), 53 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 16201 et seq., and the Hotel Room Rental Tax (tax) were unconstitutional and were also unenforceable as applied to the partnership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a city council enacted a tax for the support of a convention center, a partnership that operated an airport hotel sought declaratory relief that the tax and its enabling act violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. The court denied the partnership's request for a declaratory judgment. The partnership had failed to prove that the burden of the tax was palpably disproportionate to the benefit received under the tax. The partnership had not shown that it was subject to a legally significant burden; the partnership had provided no evidence that the tax reduced its revenues or discouraged the partnership from raising its rates. Moreover, the partnership had not shown an actual loss of business. Analysis from a report had demonstrated that despite the market differentiation between center city hotels and airport hotels, the airport hotels would experience an increased demand for rooms as a result of the new convention center. The act did not violate the prohibition against special laws; legislative history detailed legitimate needs for the convention center.</SPAN></P>

(Pennsylvania), as applied to them, was unconstitutional. They sought a declaration that the Ordinance abridged their First Amendment rights and an order enjoining the city from enforcing the Ordinance against them. They moved for summary judgment. The city filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promoters operated &quot;peep shows.&quot; The Ordinance required persons permitting the use for profit of any machine or device for amusement or entertainment that was operated by a coin or token to register each machine and pay an annual tax thereon. The Ordinance applied to all coin-operated entertainment devices, regardless of their communicative content. Once the tax was paid, a label or tag was issued for the year for which the tax was paid. The promoters argued that the tax on their machines amounted to a license fee or a prior restraint on their protected pornographic expression. In denying the promoters' motion, the court held that the Ordinance, which was adopted under an act for revenue-raising purposes, in no way attempted to subject the promoters to supervision and regulation of their First Amendment activities. The tax imposed no impediment to their right to show pornographic material; it affected only the manner in which they represented it. The tax, which was applied uniformly to all coin-operated entertainment devices, was a non-discriminatory, content-neutral charge, that permissibly regulated the manner in which the promoters' First Amendment rights were exercised.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was the district's burden to establish that &sect; 11-1106 was unconstitutional as it applied to the district and that it failed to meet that burden. The court further found that the classification between school districts of different sizes was a legitimate one and was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. Thus, the court found that the district's residency policy contravened &sect; 11-1106, that &sect; 11-1106 did not violate the equal protection and due process clauses, and that the district should have been precluded from enforcing its residency policy by virtue of laches and equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of homicide by vehicle and was sentenced to imprisonment and required evaluation for her addiction as well as participation in a safe driving course. Defendant began serving her sentence and filed a formal work release request, which led to her eventual release into the home monitoring program requiring her to remain in the evening within a certain distance of her home telephone and to inform her supervisors when she left for work and returned home during the day. The prosecution argued that the home monitoring was not in accord with the sentence. The court found that: (1) electronic home monitoring was not partial confinement or work release, but in fact was analogous to parole; (2) the court did not have jurisdiction to grant parole, but did retain jurisdiction to determine the validity of the decision to parole defendant; (3) the warden had in fact lacked the authority to place defendant on parole; and (4) it was proper to send defendant to a work release facility in a neighboring county to serve the remainder of her term where no appropriate facility existed for women in the county.</SPAN></P>

A regulation giving notice to a probationary employee that his probation could be terminated or permanent status denied him for failure to submit to a polygraph test appeared to be required. In the absence of such required notice there could be no ban to reinstatement. The court found no reason to rule that the requirement of notice should not be applicable to probationary employees. It could have been that the employee's privilege against self-incrimination and his fundamental right of privacy would be violated. Although the case involved a departmental (non-criminal) investigation in which the employee was not a target, it may have been transformed into a criminal investigation against him. It could not be argued that the employee waived his Fifth Amendment rights by answering questions prior to the request to repeat the same under polygraph.</SPAN></P>

Not having received payment, it instituted the action in assumpsit. The husband contended that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 116, which allowed execution against a husband for necessaries supplied to a wife, was rendered unconstitutional by the passage of the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The court noted that passage of 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2301 eliminated the gender bias contained in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 116. A creditor was still allowed to file an action against both a husband and his wife to collect debts of necessaries, but a creditor was not required to first attempt to satisfy his judgment out of the husband's assets before he was allowed to execute against a wife's separate property. Thus, &sect; 116 was not rendered unconstitutional by the ERA, but was modified by 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2301 to meet constitutional standards of equality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth charged defendant with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol to the degree which rendered him incapable of safe driving in violation of &sect; 3731(a)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Code, a misdemeanor of second degree, and operating a motor vehicle while the amount of alcohol by weight in his blood was 0.1 percent or greater, in violation of &sect; 3731(a)(4) of the Motor Vehicle Code, also a misdemeanor of the second degree. The jury acquitted defendant of the first charge but convicted him of the latter. Defendant sought judgment notwithstanding the verdict, on the ground that the inconsistency of the verdict violated his constitutional right to double jeopardy protection. The court held: (1) the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution, applicable to the Commonwealth by the 14th Amendment, did not prohibit the legislature from permitting multiple methods of proving a single offense; (2) &sect; 3731 of the Motor Vehicle Code defined a single offense, driving under the influence, and provided four methods of proof; and (3) defendant's acquittal under one method of proof did not prohibit his conviction under another.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed the orders of the court, which granted defendants' motion to suppress evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire occurred at the premises of defendants' business, and defendants submitted a claim to their fire insurance carrier. After the fire was determined to have been of an incendiary nature, defendants were each charged with arson, criminal conspiracy, attempted theft by unlawful taking or disposition, and risking catastrophe. At trial, the court granted defendants' motion to suppress tainted evidence. The commonwealth appealed, contending that the court's suppression of evidence materially affected its ability to proceed at trial. First, the court held that the transcript of the examination of defendants conducted by insurance counsel was properly suppressed because the insurance counsel acted as an agent of the commonwealth during the course of its investigation of the fire, pursuant to the Arson Reporting Immunity Act, 40 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1610.1 et seq. The court reasoned that private individuals could assume governmental functions that were tantamount to the private individual's becoming an agent of the commonwealth. The court also held that the examination of defendants under oath by the insurance counsel was compelled testimony that was violative of their Fifth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the suppression of the evidence, finding that the evidence represented derivative fruit of the poisonous tree. The commonwealth's notion of ultimate or inevitable discovery was inapplicable because the commonwealth failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information would have been discovered by other lawful means.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger was injured when another vehicle struck the car in which she was riding. She filed a claim for first-party benefits against the company as the insurer of the driver of the car in which she was riding. The company denied the claim pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1714 (1934), on the ground that at the time of the accident the passenger was the owner of a registered vehicle that did not have financial responsibility as defined by the Act. The passenger filed an action to have &sect; 1714 declared unconstitutional as it applied to her and to recover benefits. The court held that there was a rational basis for denying the passenger benefits under &sect; 1714. The court found that the Act sought to remedy the rising cost of consumer automobile insurance. The court stated that those who owned vehicles but did not insure them reduced the pool of money available to pay insurance claims. The Act promoted the purchase of insurance by all registered vehicle owners by defining a class of people who could not recover insurance benefits.

Based upon the fingerprints, burglary charges were filed against defendant. Defendant moved to suppress the fingerprint evidence. The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the motion as untimely. The court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the motion to suppress the evidence. The motion was not untimely because Pa. R. Crim. Proc. 322 was inapplicable to juvenile proceedings. The taking of defendant after the hearing was an arrest that was not based upon a reasonable belief that he violated the conditions of his probation. The order was issued without any showing of probable cause and authorized an unconstitutional seizure of defendant. Defendant was not in lawful custody when he was fingerprinted. Defendant was denied the constitutional mandated notice of the accusation against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were pharmacists who were arrested in the first forum on fraud charges. After a lengthy preliminary hearing, that prosecution was discharged. The parties disputed whether the court had the jurisdiction to enjoin the Commonwealth from re-arresting defendants in the second forum under the Fraud and Abuse Control Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 1401, and specifically the venue provision, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 1411. The court determined that it had jurisdiction to enter the injunction because under the broad jurisdictional mandate given to the court of common pleas, Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 5; 42 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 93, it may exercise its equity jurisdiction to enjoin a criminal prosecution where a fundamental question of constitutionality or legal right was involved. The Commonwealth's attempt to re-arrest in the second forum would have deprived defendants of substantive due process. Further, the venue provision did not provide for re-arrest in the second forum, and such action was not permissible by implication.

The court granted defendants' motion for an injunction against their rearrest in the new county, finding that the commonwealth was limited to proceeding against defendants in the county where charges were originally filed. The court found that it had jurisdiction of the case because it presented a question of defendants' constitutional right to fairness in their prosecution. Since &sect; 1411 did not provide for rearrest in a second forum, allowing such rearrest would have encouraged forum shopping by prosecutors and it would have been unfair to defendants to require them to defend prosecution in an additional county, the court granted defendants an injunction against their rearrest in another county.</SPAN></P>

All of defendants contended that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511(c) was unconstitutionally broad and vague as applied to them because they could not be guilty under the statute for being present at the barn. Police officers arrived at the barn of defendant one after they received a tip. When the officers arrived at the barn, defendant one told the officers that the other defendants were at his barn to witness two cockfights. The officers took a series of graphic photographs, which were admitted at trial without objection. On review, the court found that defendants could be found guilty under &sect; 5511(c) if they encouraged, aided, or assisted the cockfight. The court noted that Pennsylvania had a history of prosecutions for attendance at a cockfight. In addition, the court held that the statement by defendant one was properly admitted into evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township filed an action for declaratory judgment to seek a ruling on the enforceability of Whitehall Township, Pa., Home Rule Charter art. III, &sect; 3.07 and &sect; 1703 of the Administrative Code of Whitehall Township, Pa., which prohibited a commissioner from holding any other governmental office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township prohibited two persons from serving as commissioners because they held positions with a school district or with the commonwealth. The township sought a determination whether the provisions of its charter and administrative code that prohibited the holding of two governmental positions were constitutional. The court held that the provisions were unconstitutional insofar as they restricted township commissioners from holding any compensated governmental office other than compensated positions as township employees. The court found that the provisions served to protect compelling governmental interests to avoid direct or indirect conflicts of interest and to assure that commissioners served with undivided loyalty and without any appearance of impropriety. However the provisions were not the least drastic means to achieve those compelling interests because the commissioners could abstain from voting in situations where a conflict of interest was possible. The court found that the employee of another governmental entity would find himself in a potential conflict of interest situation so infrequently as to make the issue as a practical matter de minimus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident was injured and her five children died when a fire broke out in the residence. The Housing Authority failed to install smoke detectors, but conceded that had there been a smoke detector in the house, the children would have survived. At the time of the fire, no applicable code or regulation mandated that smoke detectors be installed. On appeal, the Housing Authority contended that the lost earnings awards to the children's estates were unfairly prejudiced and inflated by the admission of testimony of a non-economist who forecast their future earnings. The Housing Authority also argued that it was protected by a statutory damages limitation as an agency of the Commonwealth. The court held that the non-economist was qualified to testify as to the decedents' projected lost earnings. He was a licensed psychologist, had practiced vocational rehabilitation for 25 years, and was an expert vocational consultant. He was familiar with earnings by occupation, and his calculations were based upon statistical tables of the Bureau of Census. The court held that the Housing Authority was not a Commonwealth agency because it was predominately funded by federal sources.</SPAN></P>

In support of her petition for habeas corpus, the accused contended that sexual activity required intercourse and, as none was observed, the charges should be dismissed. The Commonwealth argued that &quot;sado-masochistic sexual stimulation&quot; met the requirement of sexual activity. The court agreed with the Commonwealth and denied the petition. In so ruling, the court noted that the statute was previously determined to not be unconstitutionally vague. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902(f) included in the definition of sexual activity homosexual and other deviate sexual relations. Sad-masochism was a type of sexual activity, and sexual activity did not require penetration or intercourse. There was evidence that the accused charged a fee for entrance to her premises.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The same arguments made by defendant were raised and addressed and denied in a prior matter. The only remaining argument that was not addressed in that prior matter was the effect of &sect; 6503 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6503. That statute provided for a fine and imprisonment of not more than one year for persons who were convicted of a second or subsequent violation. The court noted that the Constitution required that one accused of a &quot;serious offense&quot; had to be given a jury trial. The question was whether the crime was serious. On review, the court held that &sect; 6503 was not mandatory, and that the stricter sentences dictated therein could have been imposed only if the Commonwealth gave defendant notice that it intended to do so and the case was placed on the regular criminal trial list. The Commonwealth had only argued that the mandatory 90-day prison term was applicable. Because the sentence was for less than six months, defendant's case was not a serious offense that required a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seventeen property owners filed a class-action suit challenging their county property tax assessments. They asserted that the assessments were based upon unit-price methodology and did not reflect the current market or actual value of their properties, as required by &sect; 5453.602. Defendants filed six preliminary objections to the complaint and the court dismissed the matter on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The court concluded that the property owners failed to exhaust the mandatory administrative remedy set forth in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5453.701. Under that provision, the property owners were required to appeal to the county board of assessment appeals before presenting the matter for review with the court, unless an attack on the validity of the statute was included. Because the property owners did not allege that the Law was unconstitutional, or that their legal remedy was inadequate, the court lacked equitable jurisdiction over the case. The court also rejected the claim that judicial review was more appropriate for the class-action form of proceeding. The interest of all property owners was not identical, but separate.</SPAN></P>

He appealed that decision to the court, which dismissed the appeal. The court upheld the dismissal of the appeal. The officer was not denied due process because he was not entitled to a hearing prior to the suspension. The Commission was not required to order discovery and the officer was not prejudiced thereby. There was no error in the Commission's refusal to bifurcate the hearing. His prior disciplinary record was properly considered on the discipline issue only. There was no violation of a 30-day investigation requirement that concerned outside complaints, not internally generated investigations.

On appeal, defendants invoked the statutory exception, testifying that the driver of the lead vehicle had stopped it in the middle of a highway about 100 feet east of the intersection and had dismounted and stood there with a red flag, directing traffic, and had also directed defendants by two-way radio to come through the intersection without stopping. The Commonwealth attacked the credibility of defendants on the theory that if defendants' story of traffic direction were true, in would have been natural for them to mention it to the police officer who made the traffic stop. On reversal, the court held that the Commonwealth had the burden of negating the statutory exception, both by producing evidence on the issue and by persuasion of the fact-finder beyond a reasonable doubt. The language of the statutory exception of &sect; 3323(b) was incorporated as an integral part of the definition of the offense instead of expressing the exception separately and distinctly from that definition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of rape, statutory rape, indecent exposure, corruption of a minor and simple assault, but not guilty of aggravated assault or recklessly endangering another person. On post-trial motions, defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and that the taking of the testimony of the complainant over closed circuit television violated his constitutional rights. The court found that there was no doubt that the attack on the complainant occurred as she indicated. All the evidence pointed to defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court denied the motion that the convictions were contrary to the weight of the evidence. In addition, the court denied that there was a violation of defendant's constitutional rights when the complainant was permitted to testify by closed circuit television. The taking of testimony of a child victim by closed circuit television under the circumstances described did not in any way infringe upon defendant's constitutional rights. The constitutional mandates were met when defendant had an opportunity to see and hear the witness testify and opportunity for cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county detective observed defendant conducting bingo games in the name of an athletic association. He was not an officer of the association nor did he have a license to conduct the bingo games. He was a member of the association. No written records were kept of monies and merchandise collected and distributed. Defendant first argued that the Bingo Law imposed duties and criminal responsibilities solely upon an &quot;association.&quot; However, the court held that the legislature obviously intended to prohibit the described acts. An association was a concept and was required to act through people. The legislature did not intend that people could perform the prohibited acts in the name of the association and defend by arguing that only the association was prohibited from so acting and not the people. Thus, defendant, who individually conducted a bingo game in violation of the Bingo Law, was guilty of a misdemeanor. Defendant next argued that the Bingo Law was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed. The law gave a clear and unequivocal warning of what acts exposed defendant to liability and what the penalties were.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the Commonwealth stipulated that defendant was a homeless, chronic alcoholic and that his conduct violated 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5505. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 5505 violated the Eighth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. The cases cited by defendant involved statutes that penalized excessive drinking to the point of intoxication or the status of being addicted or intoxicated. In contrast, &sect; 5505 sought to punish conduct, i.e., being manifestly under the influence of alcohol in a public place to a degree that it might endanger other persons or property or annoy persons in the vicinity. The legislature's use of the criminal system to protect citizens from the annoying conduct of public drunks was permissible. Defendant, through the voluntary intake of alcohol, could not immunize himself from the criminal sanctions for public drunkenness. The statute was enacted to deal with the problem of chronic alcoholics who voluntarily appeared in public, causing disruption and annoyance, and it was properly directed to protecting the general public against antisocial acts that violated public order and decency just like the disorderly conduct statute.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 301 et seq. The Township and Authority filed motions to strike and demurrers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fundamental dispute involved the question of whether the mobile homes at issue had to be hooked up to the new sewer system constructed under the project. The mobile home parks were already served by sewer facilities constructed under state permits, and the partnership and citizens argued that the project was being undertaken under the wrong statute and was an abuse of discretion. The court found that: (1) the Municipality Authority Act of 1945, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 301 et seq., applied where it was clearly a case involving a municipal authority's construction of a sewer; (2) there was no impropriety in the provisions for financing the bonds; (3) the existence of two separate systems for building sewers did not violate the right to equal protection where the reasons for the two classifications were appropriate; (4) the allegations of fraud in connection with the project were unsupported and the argument that the Authority and Township had abused their discretion was meritless; and (5) the permits under which the mobile home parks were operated required them to cease using their sewage facilities upon the construction of new facilities by the Authority and Municipality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the demurrers with prejudice, held that the other preliminary objections were moot, corrected the caption to show the proper parties, and held that individual supervisors and Authority members were to be dropped as party defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he refused to take the breath test for blood alcohol content and that the officer informed defendant that his refusal would result in a one year's license suspension as was required under Pa. Vehicle Code &sect; 1542(b)(2). However, defendant stated that the officer informed him that he could be entitled to admission to the first offender program, which would result in only a one month's suspension of his license. Thereafter, the secretary suspended defendant's license for one year. Defendant appealed the secretary's decision. The court held that it was satisfied that defendant was confused when the officer discussed the one month suspension as an alternative to the one year suspension. In light of the statutory language that the license &quot;will be suspended&quot; for refusal of testing, that is, that suspension for refusal was a certainty, the court held that a warning that suspension was but a possibility did not comply with the statute and would not support suspension for refusal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a refuse service, brought two actions against defendants, an individual and the business he operated, to collect unpaid garbage bills from both defendants. Defendants admitted their liability for the unpaid garbage collection service, but disputed the amount of the charges and the manner in which they were assessed by a solid waste enforcement officer pursuant to local ordinance. Defendants filed crossmotions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed the crossmotions for summary judgment from both the service and defendants in response to the service's action to collect defendants' unpaid garbage bills incurred after a rate increase was imposed by the local solid waste enforcement officer. Defendants contended that under Pennsylvania law the power to fix refuse collection charges for services rendered by a municipal agency was a legislative function vested in a borough council and could not be delegated to a committee or an administrative officer. The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the service, concluding that the discretion given to the enforcement officer to set rates for garbage collection different from that established by the borough's council was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, and the service was only entitled to collect charges as set by the borough council in Meyersdale Borough, Pa., Ordinance 273, &sect; 16. The court also held that a resolution adopted by the borough council in an attempt to amend the rates chargeable under an existing ordinance was invalid because it did meet the notice and publication requirements of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 46006(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the service in each of the actions, finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact except the actual amount of damages owed to the service by defendants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper claimed that the court's adverse inference charge and its ruling on the Pennsylvania Shield Law (shield law), 42 Pa.

The court found that because the reporter who wrote the defamatory articles was available but did not testify, it charged that the jury could draw an adverse inference from this failure to testify. The newspaper contended that the reporter's physical condition precluded his testimony and it produced a letter stating that it was medically inadvisable for him to testify, although he was writing and traveling at the time of the trial. The court upheld its charge because there was no competent evidence showing the reporter's physical inability to testify. The court also upheld its ruling that if the newspaper relied on the shield law to prevent disclosure of its sources, it could not use evidence from those sources. The court held that this remedy balanced the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press with an individual's right to protect his reputation and have access to the facts needed for his case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected the student's argument that his cause of action was within the real property exception of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8542(b)(3). The student averred no defect in any district property, nor claimed that such a defect caused his injuries. Therefore, he failed, by these omissions, to state a cause of action as a matter of law. In addition, his claim that the district and its employees were negligent with respect to a school activity and in failing to provide him with prompt medical attention was clearly outside the limited waiver for actions relating to the care and control of real property.

She filed her motion to quash and contended that &sect; 5902(a) was void for vagueness as applied to her, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court noted that one common pleas court had determined that such an activity did not fall within the purview of prostitution because there was no penetration involved, but another common pleas court had found that the activity did fall within the other sexual acts described in the statute pertaining to prostitution. The court noted that there was no impact on the First Amendment and the vagueness analysis was limited to whether an ascertainable standard of conduct had been established. It held that there was an ascertainable standard of conduct that was not vague as it applied to defendant. She was on notice that masturbation for hire was within the range of activities prohibited by the statute. The constitutionality of the statute was supported by the presumption of constitutionality as set forth in 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1922(3).</SPAN></P>

At the station, defendant first consented to take a breathalyzer test and then refused to take it without his attorney. On review, the court first held that under the facts, the breathalyzer stage of criminal proceedings was not a &quot;critical stage&quot; allowing defendant the right to confer with counsel before taking the test. There was no suggestive variation in the technology, and defendant had been informed of his right not to take the test. Second, the officer had a statutory right to stop defendant because he was in the boundaries of the officer's jurisdiction. The officer's testimony was found to be credible. Third, under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;8952, the officer had probable cause to pursue and stop defendant because he observed him driving erratically. Fourth, the mandatory minimum sentencing provision did not violate the separation of powers by eliminating the judicial discretion with respect to the imposition of sentences. The legislature had the power to fix the penalty, but the court determined if the burden of proof was met. Finally, the court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 65, &sect; 403(a). Defendant filed an omnibus pretrial motion, which comprised a motion for severance, seven motions to quash bills of information, a motion for additional pretrial discovery, and a motion for pretrial conference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One information charged defendant with two counts of violating the Pennsylvania Ethics Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 65, &sect; 403(a), because of his acceptance of free lodging and meals at an establishment that was a Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board licensed establishment. Another information charged that defendant unlawfully disclosed to the owner of a business that his establishment was under investigation. In granting in part the motion for severance and otherwise denying the pretrial motion, the court found that proof of defendant's transaction with the establishment would be prejudicial at a separate trial on the charges relating to the business. The court was unable to say that one or more of the investigative resources of the grand jury were not required in order to adequately investigate the matter. It would be error for the court to quash the information based on the alleged inadequacy of the Commonwealth's evidence. Defendant clearly fell within the proscriptions of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5101 and Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 65, &sect; 403.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student argued that since the trampoline was an activity for which government-owned property was regularly used, for which it was intended to be used, and for which it was reasonably foreseen to be used, the exception to immunity in &sect; 202(b)(3) of the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 5311.201 et seq. (repealed), applied. Section 202(b)(3) provided an exception for the care, custody, or control of real property in the possession of the political subdivision. The court stated that since the student admitted in her brief that the trampoline was not physically attached to the land, it had to be concluded that the trampoline was personalty. The court noted that the commonwealth court had held that the failure to supervise employees or students did not fall within the scope of &quot;care, custody or control of real property.&quot; The court stated that having concluded that it could not interpret the Act to waive immunity as to the unfortunate incident at issue solely because it occurred on the district's real property, it was constrained to grant the district's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The will provided that the residue of the decedent's estate went to his wife at the time he made the will, from whom the decedent was divorced from at the time of his death. The alternative residue gift provision provided that if the wife did not survive the decedent, then all the residue went to the decedent's son in trust until he was 21 years of age and to the step-daughters. The issue before the court was whether the failure of the gift to the divorced spouse rendered the will null and void resulting in an intestacy or whether the failure of the gift merely negated the provision in favor of the divorced spouse and created the gift to the alternately named residuary beneficiaries. The court found that the intent of the decedent and the language of the will were very clear. The court held that under 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2507(2), the decedent's will was modified to excise the residuary gift in favor of the divorced spouse and the residue passed, as intended, in trust to the son until he reached the age of 21, and then to the son and the step-daughters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator presented his account to the trial court, suggesting that the decedent's parents should receive the entire estate. The decedent's illegitimate minor children asserted a claim based on intestate laws. The trial court noted that, at the time of the decedent's death, the Pennsylvania Probate Code &sect; 2107, 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2107 barred an illegitimate child from inheriting through his father, but that &sect; 2107 had been declared unconstitutional. The trial court accorded the children their constitutional right of equal protection under the law, based on case law holding that a child born out of wedlock whose father died prior to November 26, 1978, should be given the opportunity to prove by clear and convincing evidence his relationship to the decedent. As the parties had admitted the decedent's paternity of the children, the trial court held that the children were entitled to share in the estate.

The court found that the husband could not be forced to repay the benefits he received because the wife was the owner of the vehicle involved and the obligation to pay back was from the owner or registrant of the vehicle.

Defendant's arguments that &sect; 3731(a)(1) and &sect; 3731(a)(4) defined completely different offenses, and that the court erred in not indicating which offense was the basis for the conviction, were devoid of merit. The court also ruled that defendant's conviction was supported by the evidence, as a blood alcohol test indicated that his blood contained 0.109 percent or 0.108 percent alcohol by weight 53 minutes after he was apprehended by a trooper, the delay between his apprehension and the administration of the test was insignificant, the trooper had smelled an odor of alcohol coming from him, and he had admitted to consuming a six-pack of beer earlier that evening.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed post-trial motions for a new trial or arrest of judgment. Defendant had been convicted upon a jury verdict for committing the crimes of solicitation to commit simple assault and solicitation to obstruct the administration of law. The court had admitted a tape of defendant's conversation with a consenting, undisclosed informant under the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (Act), 18 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sought to hire an individual to beat up a man with whom defendant was having a problem. The individual went to the police and reported the incident. The individual wore a body recorded supplied by the police to his meeting with defendant. The tape, which was admitted into evidence during the Commonwealth's case-in-chief, was the key evidence in the case. The tape established that defendant agreed to pay the individual to beat up the man. Defendant argued that the procedure authorizing police officers or their agents to record private conversations without a warrant under the Act diminished fundamental principles of privacy embodied in the Pennsylvania Constitution. Denying the motion, the court held that defendant's reposing a trust or confidence in the individual, an undisclosed informant, raised no legitimate Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy right. Recording the conversation with the individual's consent was not a Fourth Amendment violation. Without a Fourth Amendment right, there was no need for a warrant based on probable cause. A misplaced belief by defendant that the individual would not reveal his confidence was not protected by the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the court erred in admitting the results of a blood alcohol test performed about an hour after he drove his vehicle. In rejecting that argument, the court found that the Code provided for chemical testing to determine alcoholic content of blood. The statute did not specify that to be admissible, a chemical test had to be performed within any stated time after the incident or arrest. The court had previously held that a one and one-half hour delay between a motorist's arrest and the performance of a blood test did not render the results inadmissible. The effect that the passage of time may have had on the test results was for the jury to consider. Defendant also claimed that since the jury found him not guilty of violating &sect; 3731(a)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Code (Pennsylvania), it could not consistently convict him of violating &sect; 3731(a)(4) of the Motor Vehicle Code. The court, however, did not find the verdict, finding the alcoholic content of defendant's blood to exceed that permitted under the Code, to be inconsistent with rejection of that percentage of blood alcohol in defendant's blood establishing that he was unfit to operate a vehicle with safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action involved a post-divorce partition of real and personal property owned by plaintiff former wife and defendant former husband.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with the court's prior direction, the trustee's first report dealt only with identifying how the various items of property were owned by the parties and thereby determining what property were entireties property and as such subject to the action. The proposed decree made that determination, to which the husband had filed the pending exceptions. Running through all or most of the exceptions was a challenge to the trustee's application of a rule that any property acquired in anticipation or during marriage and possessed and used by both spouses was presumed to be held as joint property by the entireties unless contrary evidence of intent was adequately demonstrated. Because it was acknowledged that the real estate of the parties was held by the entireties, the question of the presumption related only to ownership of personal property. The court held that the trustee did not state the presumption too broadly. The presumption extended to any property acquired for the family enterprise and not merely household goods. Therefore, any tangible non-business personal property acquired in anticipation during the marriage was rebuttably presumed to be entireties property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prosecution for driving under the influence of alcohol, the court issued a rule to show cause requiring the Commonwealth to provide the legal basis for requiring the court to direct completion of a sentencing guideline form provided by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing, to make it a part of the record in the case, and to submit a copy to the Commission pursuant to the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, 204 Pa. Code &sect; 303.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth submitted to the court for its use a sentencing guideline form provided by the Commission. Recognizing a requirement set forth in 204 Pa. Code &sect; 303.1(b) that the court direct completion of the form, make it a part of the record in the case within 20 days, and submit a copy to the Commission, the court raised the question of a legislatively-created commission's authority to direct such action on the part of the judiciary. The court concluded that the guideline sentence form requirement was inconsistent with the doctrine of separation of powers and thus was not binding on the courts. It was within the exclusive province of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, under Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c), to establish rules of practice and procedure for such matters as the documents and materials to be included in the record of a sentencing proceeding, the time limitations within which a lower court had to act, and the manner in which lower courts were to proceed under the sentencing limitations set by the legislature. There could be no justification for requiring the judiciary, a co-equal branch of government, to report to the legislature on individual sentencing decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the Commission's regulation requiring the completion and submission of sentencing guideline forms was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine and thus was not binding upon the courts.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were sentenced pursuant to the Pennsylvania Mandatory Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9712 et seq. Both defendants appealed and argued that the Act was unconstitutional because they were not afforded notice of the sentencing enhancement and the firearm element only had to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held the Act constitutional. The court found that the Act provided notice and gave no unfettered discretion to the Commonwealth since only certain enumerated felonies were covered by the Act. The factual situations presented in the instant cases clearly illustrated that the preponderance of the evidence section was completely independent from the other parts of the Act. The fact finder in both these cases, applying a reasonable doubt standard, found defendants guilty of aggravated assault and robbery, respectfully, by use of a firearm. The preponderance of the evidence clause was not involved in nor had any bearing upon the outcome of these cases.

Defendant was convicted. On appeal, he argued that his assignment to the Program and the subsequent denial of his waiver of a jury trial violated his constitutional rights. The court disagreed. The Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, affirmed the inviolability of the right to trial by jury, while Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 guaranteed only that a criminal defendant would receive an impartial jury trial. Because in Pennsylvania waiving a jury trial was not a constitutional right but one created entirely by court rule, denying a waiver request based on inclusion in the Program did not violate any fundamental due process right guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Constitution. Nor did the fact that a Program defendant would generally be compelled to waive before a judge who knew of his prior criminal record violate equal protection because the Program rationally furthered the state's legitimate interest in reducing recidivism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been suffering from mental illness for many years, robbed a store at gun point, ran from police in a high speed chase, and was shot. At his trial for robbery, theft, aggravated and simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, resisting arrest, terroristic threats, and weapons violations, defendant pleaded insanity. The court found that in order to successfully prove an insanity defense, defendant had to demonstrate that he either did not know the nature and quality of his acts or that he did not know right from wrong. The court held that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving defendant sane at the time he committed the crimes. The court found that defendant's insanity defense failed because from the attendant circumstances it appeared that although defendant was sick when he committed the crimes, he knew that what he was doing was wrong. Defendant apologized to police and showed mercy to his victims. Defendant's crime was planned and methodically carried out. The fact that defendant was mentally ill did not effect defendant's ability to know that he was committing a crime. Therefore, the court found defendant guilty but mentally ill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a one-car accident to which there were no eyewitnesses, and defendant had no recollection of what happened. Defendant's vehicle apparently left the road and went over a bank into some trees; two of the three people in the vehicle were dead when the vehicle was found. The court found that the proof was insufficient to convict defendant under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732 because the expert the Commonwealth relied upon to establish the underlying motor vehicle violations could not fix the speed of the vehicle when it left the road or state that the vehicle was out of control. The physical facts of the markings on the road could not be considered incontrovertible in the absence of oral evidence regarding the movement or speed of the vehicle. The Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of proof because its evidence was contradictory as to whether defendant had control of the vehicle when it left the road. There was thus reasonable doubt as to whether defendant was guilty of the underlying offenses of driving at an unsafe speed and reckless driving. The evidence, in fact, tended to show that defendant's conduct was excusable as an &quot;accidental misadventure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions and that the Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act (Pennsylvania) was unconstitutional. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions. The Act was constitutional. First, pursuant to due process requirements, defendant was given pre-trial notice that the Commonwealth was proceeding under the Act. Next, through the Act, the legislature did not define a new set of crimes. Defendant was properly convicted of the crimes for which he was charged by a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The sentencing enhancement imposed by the Act because a weapon was used in the criminal activity was constitutionally proper since after a conviction, defendant could be sentenced by a showing of the preponderance of the evidence that he used a firearm in the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff elected officials sought a mandamus order and a peremptory judgment directing defendant county commissioners to approve and pay certain salaries in accordance with a schedule provided for in an ordinance adopted by a former board of commissioners. The county commissioners filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the former ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mandamus was appropriate if the elected officials' right to certain salaries was clear and there was a want of any other adequate remedy. The court determined that the right to be vindicated was not sufficiently &quot;clear&quot; because it depended on a determination that an ordinance was invalid. The court also found that declaratory judgment or an action of assumpsit were available as alternative remedies. In the interests of justice, the court proceeded to determine the case on the merits regardless of the procedural defect. Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 27 prohibited the increase or decrease of a public officer's salary after his election. The elected officials contended that an ordinance reducing their salaries was unconstitutional, and the county commissioners contended that a prior ordinance increasing their salaries was unconstitutional. The court determined that both ordinances were constitutional. The fact that they were passed during an elected official's term of office did not invalidate them. There was no constitutional impediment to passing an ordinance changing salaries, even though that revised salary could not be constitutionally paid to any individual then holding office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court decreed that the ordinance passed by the prior board of commissioners was constitutional and that the elected officials and the county commissioners should be paid the salaries provided therein during their present elected terms of office. The court decreed that the county commissioners' current ordinance was constitutional, but it did not apply to the elected officials or the county commissioners during their present terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant objected to being sentenced under the act relating to certain offenses committed with firearms. Defendant attacked the act on the ground that it constituted an impermissible delegation of legislative power to the executive branch in violation of the Pennsylvania constitution. Defendant had been convicted of aggravated assault after admitting to the shooting of the victim. The State gave notice to defendant of the State's intention to seek a five-year sentence in accordance with the act. Defendant argued that the act was fatally flawed because the act was not self-executing. If it were, it would apply to every defendant situated as he was today, dictating that no one could escape mandatory minimum imprisonment of at least five years. The court found that that the act gave the district attorney the option to invoke its sanction whenever he saw fit to do so. Although that called for an exercise of discretion, the court found that the legislature failed to provide the district attorney, or the court, with any criteria or yardstick against which the exercise of such discretion could be measured.</SPAN></P>

The court also denied defendant's claim that the ordinance was vague and incapable of being understood by a reasonably intelligent person. The definition of &quot;sound&quot; used in the ordinance, while technical, was capable of ordinary understanding. The court also found that the ordinance was not overbroad because it was directed toward conduct and not communication.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a program to detect and apprehend intoxicated drivers, four state policemen conducted a traffic checkpoint where they stopped all north and southbound traffic. When defendant's vehicle was checked, an odor of alcohol was detected on his breath and a mug with amber-colored liquid was observed in the vehicle. Defendant, who appeared somewhat stupefied, was advised of his Miranda rights and gave his consent to field sobriety tests. Based on the results, he was taken to the police barracks where a breathalyzer test was administered that indicated a blood alcohol level of .19. In his motion to suppress the test results, defendant claimed that his vehicle was stopped in violation of the federal and Pennsylvania constitutions. In denying the motion, the court ruled that stops at fixed safety checkpoints were not random searches that violated the Fourth Amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an injured swimmer, initiated a case against defendant property owners and sought to recover damages for injuries sustained on the property owners' premises. The property owners filed a motion for summary judgment and claimed that they were immune from liability under the Pennsylvania Recreational Use of Land and Water Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, &sect; 477-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The swimmer commenced a personal injury case against the property owners and sought to recover damages for injuries he sustained while swimming in a creek on the property owners' premises. The property owners filed a motion for summary judgment claiming immunity from liability under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, &sect; 477-1. The court granted the property owners' motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in their favor because the swimmer was using the premises for recreational purposes and the property owners had no duty to warn him of the low water level, which was caused by a draught. There was no evidence that the drought had existed for a sufficient length of time to constitute constructive notice to the property owners that the water level was dangerous. In addition, there was no reason for the property owners to know that the swimmer would dive headfirst into the creek, which was unusual conduct that could not have been anticipated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an application to correct an illegal sentence, which was imposed following a plea bargain agreement whereby defendant pled guilty to driving under the influence in violation of 75 Pa.

The court denied defendant's application to correct his sentence because it found that &sect; 3731(a)(4) was not a summary offense and the imposed sentence was not illegal. The court determined that defendant got a good bargain when he entered the plea agreement and that there had not been a judicial determination that a violation of &sect; 3731(a)(4) was a summary offense. The court concluded that defendant waived the right to challenge his sentence because the purpose of the plea bargain was to give him a better benefit than he would have otherwise obtained.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the mandatory minimum sentencing provision did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. The legislature had the right to classify crimes and to fix the maximum and minimum penalty to be imposed. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the bill violated Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The court found that the language in the title of the bill afforded sufficient notice to advise the public of changes in the penalties imposed for driving while under the influence. The last clause of the act's title expressly provided for the increased penalty and changes in the disposition of fines and penalties. The court rejected defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient. On the night in question an officer noted that defendant's driving was erratic, that the odor of alcohol was detected on defendant's breath, and that his speech was impaired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made a motion in arrest of judgment for his conviction for driving while under suspension. Defendant's violations spanned both the &quot;old&quot; and the &quot;new&quot; drunk driving laws. One issue was whether the law in effect during the prior offense, Act of June 17, 1976, P.L. 162. No. 81; 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1543, or the law in effect during the present offense, Act of June 17, 1976, as amended December 15, 1976, P.L. 1268, No. 239, applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was arrested for driving under the influence, the penalty for driving under suspension was a smaller fine and no imprisonment, with no distinction made as to why the license was originally suspended. However, when defendant drove under suspension, the penalty had been raised to a large mandatory fine and imprisonment if the suspension resulted from drunk driving. The court held that the statute in effect when defendant drove under suspension governed. The court rejected the argument that double jeopardy occurred, stating that prosecution for driving under suspension was the initial prosecution and was not a prosecution for driving under the influence as was the first charge. The court also rejected arguments of an excessive fine and cruel and unusual punishment, stating that the fine imposed was much less than the maximum and that the punishment was no more cruel and unusual than the thousands of deaths and injuries involving emotional heartbreak and financial ruin caused by persons driving under the influence. The court concluded that a maximum 90-day sentence did not apply to imprisonment for convictions of summary offenses.</SPAN></P>

Under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, a local agency was liable for injuries resulting from acts involving the care, custody or control of personal property only if the property belongs to others and was in possession or control of the agency, but was immune from liability for injuries resulting from acts involving the care, custody or control of personal property which belonged to the agency even though in the possession or control of the agency. Counsel for the school district argued that under traditional concepts of property law, the machine in question was personal property, not a fixture of real property, and that the school district was immune from liability. The court held that while attachment of the machine was not essential to its operation, it was essential to its proper and safe operation under governmental regulation and hence the machine was real property for liability purposes, even though the fact or mode of attachment was not causually related to the injury.</SPAN></P>

After hearing oral argument on defendant's motion, the court concluded that &sect; 9712 was constitutionally defective in its provision that a sentencing judge was required to make a determination by a preponderance of the evidence as to whether a defendant visibly possessed a firearm during the course of committing the offense The court noted that facts relating to acts that constituted a crime for which a defendant could have been punished were for the trier of fact to determine at trial. Because defendant was charged with the crime of first-degree robbery while visibly possessing a firearm, he was entitled through Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 to a jury trial. By removing the determination of whether defendant visibly possessed a firearm from the finder of fact the legislature denied defendant this constitutional right. The fact that defendant elected not to be tried by a jury did not remedy the problem, because the choice of a jury trial would have afforded defendant no protection on the issue of the visible possession of a firearm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was adjudicated of being guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the district attorney's office moved to invoke the Pennsylvania Mandatory Sentencing Act, which provided for a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment. The court had found defendant not guilty of possessing an instrument of crime. During an emotional confrontation with the victim, who was defendant's former lover and the father of her child, defendant shot the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim had shown a brutal indifference to both defendant and her child. The court found that defendant's act rose only to the level of voluntary manslaughter because she had not intended to use the gun criminally when she took possession of it. Finding no element of intent, the court stated that the Act was never intended to refer to a heat of passion killing committed by an emotionally involved, otherwise law abiding citizen who succumbed to rage or panic and killed a lover or family member. The Act was designed to put violent and repeat criminals behind bars for at least five years. The court applied a three-prong test to find that the imposition of a five-year mandatory prison sentence was disproportionate to the offense and, therefore, cruel and unusual. The notion of appropriate punishment of defendant did not require a five-year imprisonment, miles from her young daughter. Reversing, the court concluded that the application of the Act to defendant would constitute a denial of equal protection because, by the single fact of her use of a gun, she would have been sentenced differently than all other voluntary manslaughter defendants who killed with weapons other than a gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained an arrest warrant based on books they had purchased at defendants' adult book store. Defendants' pre-trial motions challenging the constitutionality of the Act and claiming that the seizure of the materials without an adversary hearing was improper were dismissed. Defendants were arrested and convicted. During the trial, the prosecution did not produce any expert testimony regarding contemporary community standards. Denying the motion, the court determined that the Act was constitutional. The court concluded that expert testimony was not required to show that the books were obscene. The court relied on the books themselves to determine that the books appealed to prurient interests. Under the local Obscenity Ordinance in Philadelphia, Pa., Code 10-1100, the sale of obscene material was prohibited. Defendants' failure to file a motion to suppress the evidence seized under the search warrant waived their right to challenge the warrant under Pa. R. Crim. P. 323(b). The Act was constitutional because obscene material was not protected by First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Act did not violate equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants. The district attorney refused to recommend defendants for ARD. Most defendants were rejected because of the prosecutor's policy to reject any ARD application if defendant applying had a blood-alcohol percentage of at least .20 at the time of testing. One defendant was rejected because he was charged with a second offense. Defendants argued that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(d) provided an exclusive list of categories for rejection of ARD. Defendants did not meet the criteria of &sect; 3731(d). The court noted that each county was required by statute to establish an ARD program. The court held that the Commonwealth had discretion in determining which cases to move for ARD consideration. 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1552 required only that an ARD Program be established and implemented. It did not indicate under what circumstances the district attorney is required to move for a person to be placed in the ARD Program. The court held that the district attorney's criteria were rationally related to the prosecution's interest in the ARD program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the standard of proof lacked due process under the section, which provided that a complete record of previous convictions had to be given to the trial court. On a contest of the record, the trial court had to schedule a hearing and determine by a preponderance of the evidence to impose the sentence. Agreeing that the standard lacked due process, the court said that defendant's prior record was an element equivalent to the aggravating factor element that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in a murder case. The due process remained throughout the trial and because the sentencing procedure depended on a new finding of fact and presented a different situation, defendant was entitled to the same rights and the Commonwealth held to the same duty of establishing that fact by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. For the issue of severability, the court noted that the section was so intertwined with and formed such an important part of the statute that it could hardly be said that the Legislature intended the remainder to be in effect. Severance was not provided for in the event of a finding of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The female students applied for, and were rejected, admission into an all-male high school. The female students claimed that they were denied admission solely on the basis of their sex. The female students sought a declaration that held the school board's admission policy was unconstitutional and also sought to enjoin the school board from excluding female students from admission to the all-male school based on their sex alone. The court entered its order in favor of the female students, which enjoined the school board and its officials from barring admission to the school based on gender. The court held that the issue was not res judicata de to a previous challenge over the same issue because the counsel in that action had not adequately represented the interests of the plaintiffs in that action. The court found that no collateral estoppel existed because the nature of the action had not remained static, both factually and legally. The court also found that there was no important governmental objective to be served by the single sex school and the means employed were not substantially related to their unsubstantiated theory of schooling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The successor asserted that the tax sale was defective because notice of the tax sale was not mailed to each of the record owners; delivery of the notice was not restricted to the &quot;personal addressee only,&quot; as required by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5860.602; and the address on the notice differed from the address specified in the certificate of residency set out on the deed of the property to the owners of record. In addition, he contended that the conduct of the tax sale and &sect; 5860.602 were unconstitutional because notice of the tax sale to a mortgagee of record was not mandatory. Setting aside the tax sale, the court held that defendants' argument that had the address on the notice duplicated the address given in the certificate of residency, there would have been no assurance that the notice would have reached the record owners was devoid of merit because the relevant issue was whether the Bureau mailed the notice to the record owner's last known address. Clearly, it did not. As the Bureau failed to prove that it complied with all of the statutory notice provisions, the tax sale affecting the subject property was declared invalid.</SPAN></P>

The depositors opposed the conversion and filed an action on behalf of themselves and other depositors to permanently enjoin the proposed conversion. The depositors argued that ownership of the bank and its net worth was vested exclusively in the bank's depositors, that the conversion would have illegally deprived the depositors of their equity interest in the bank without notice, hearing, or compensation, and that the state statute authorizing the conversion, 7 Pa.

The court ruled in favor of the bank and held that the depositors did not possess a constitutionally cognizable property interest in the surplus or net worth of the bank, that the proposed conversion did not constitute a taking, that &sect; 1609 was therefore constitutional, and that the depositors were not entitled to an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Glade Township, Pa., Drilling Ordinance, adopted February 15, 1982, and effective February 20, 1982, made no attempt to prohibit the drilling and operation of oil and gas wells. Its sole purpose was to regulate the location of the wells in relation to public safety and more definitively limited the operation of a well within 500 feet of a residence or place of public assembly. That was a reasonable exercise of a valid police power considering the volatile nature and hazard of oil and gas wells. The court also ruled that there was no conflict of regulations between the Ordinance and the Gas Operation Well-Drilling, Petroleum Coal Mining Act. Rather, the Ordinance was supplemental, and the Pennsylvania legislature was allowed to delegate to municipalities the power to regulate and control local matters, even though the legislative fiat addressed a broader field of regulation. The Ordinance was for a fire hazard protection of the residents of the township in drilling operations. The Act was totally silent of that surface activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant bought a used truck from a car dealer. He experienced difficulty with the truck and returned it to the dealer for repairs. He was not satisfied with the repairs and tried to have the dealer fix the truck again. The dealer then refused to perform further repairs. Defendant then erected a sign on the side of the truck that stated the dealer's name and listed his &quot;guaranteed work&quot; as follows: motor to miss, transmission to slip, transfer case to clang, and body panels to crack. The dealer removed the sign. Defendant placed another similar sign on the truck. Defendant claimed his purpose in placing the signs on the truck was to inform the dealer of his intent to pursue his complaint until he received satisfactory service and to advise the public of the unsatisfactory service he received from the dealer. The court determined that &sect; 2709(a) prohibited conduct, including speech, that was not constitutionally protected and which was intended to alarm or seriously annoy the average person. The court noted that the statute required that defendant's conduct have no legitimate purpose. The court ruled that defendant's conduct was constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence; the arresting officer advised him that his refusal to take the breathalyzer test would result in a suspension of his license, but he was not told that his refusal was admissible at trial as evidence of his guilt. Defendant argued that it was error for the trial court to admit his refusal into evidence for such purposes. The court held that defendant's refusal was relevant for such purposes. In addition, the refusal was &quot;conduct,&quot; not &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;testimony,&quot; and therefore was not entitled to the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Thus, no warning to that effect was required. In addition, opinion testimony by the officer that defendant was both intoxicated and impaired was admissible so long as the facts that lead to that opinion were first presented, and no opinion by a medical expert to that effect was required. The court also held that the prosecutor's closing argument that the arresting officers were being paid by the jurors as taxpayers did not improperly invoke the juror's economic interest and did not imply that the officers were more credible than other witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The individual requested delay damages. The court molded the verdict accordingly and denied delay damages. The court held that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.

The court noted that &sect; 8528 granted injured parties a right to recover damages from the commonwealth where no right previously existed and held that the legislature could grant limited rights of recovery. The court held that the $ 250,000 limitation on damages bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate legislative objective and did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an attempt to meet its then-current expenses, the commissioners sought permission to issue bonds or notes. They withdrew their request when the attorney petitioned to intervene in the proceedings as set forth in the Local Government Unit Debt Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6780-210. Thereafter they made repeated attempts to levy additional taxes through increasing the millage, and the attorney succeeded in having the tax declared illegal. That declaration was upheld by three courts, culminating in the state supreme court's ruling that affirmed the lower courts' decisions. This left the court with the problem of disposal of the illegally-collected taxes. Finding itself reluctant to entrust the commissioners with the disposal, given their previous disregard of court orders, the court concluded that its authority in equity allowed it to render whatever decree was necessary to ensure proper enforcement of its order. Further, &sect; 5566(b) of the Local Tax Collection Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5566(b), mandated refund of the illegal taxes, and the funds had been paid into a court-designated depository instead of into the county treasury and so need not be paid from public funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed the county treasurer and the controller to submit, within two weeks, a plan to effectuate refunding the illegally-obtained taxes to the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in assumpsit and in trespass against defendant. The assumpsit count was for breach of contract for failure to join in a coal stripping lease for royalties allegedly lost, and the other count was in trespass for damages for intentional interference with contractual relation. Before the court were defendant's preliminary objections to the amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action where plaintiff sought both damages in assumpsit and in trespass, the primary concern of the court was ascertaining the rules of law governing liability for interest in non-loan claims. The court held that the amount payable under count I, being a sum due under a contract, was to bear damage-interest at the fixed legal rate of six percent per annum. The sum due as tort damages in count II was to bear damage-interest at a rate not exceeding six percent per annum to be determined by the fact finder. The court examined at length the purpose in award of interest. It held that the usury statutes applied only to interest due on loans; usury did not apply to non-loan debts. The award of interest, in the absence of a controlling statute, rested on the equitable principles of fairness and justice and a determination of which party was at fault for the delay in payment. Conventional interest meant interest imposed by contract of the parties as distinguished from interest imposed as damages by court decree. So, in strict theory, any interest allowed after money became due, as distinguished from pre-maturity interest, was not interest but damages in the nature of interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion to strike plaintiff's claim for 12 percent interest; all other objections were overruled and defendant were allowed 30 days to answer plaintiff's amended complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife and defendant husband filed for a divorce. Before the court was an action for the equitable distribution of the marital assets. In a case of first impression for Pennsylvania, the court was presented with the question of whether &quot;nonvested&quot; pension benefits were subject to equitable distribution under the state's new Divorce Code, Act of April 2, 1980, 1980 Pa. Laws 63, &sect; 401; Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 401.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For the first time since the enactment of Pennsylvania's new Divorce Code, Act of April 2, 1980, 1980 Pa. Laws 63, &sect; 401; Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 401, the court had to determine if &quot;nonvested&quot; pension rights were marital property subject to equitable distribution, and if so, how to value them for the purposes of distribution. The court examined similar statutes in other states and concluded that nonvested pension rights were marital property largely because they were &quot;choses in action,&quot; a form of property that was acquired during the marriage and thus met the definition of marital property under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 401(e). The court held that pension rights acquired before the marriage and after the marriage did not qualify as marital property. Because the actual payment of the pension usually was far in the future, and may never come about if the covered party was fired or died, that made the pension the equivalent of a contingent annuity. The court held that many administrative problems were avoided by reducing the spouse's share of the pension to its present day value and then requiring the covered party to make a cash payment accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the wife's equitable share of her husband's nonvested pension rights be reduced to a present day value so that husband could make an immediate cash payment of equal value from the sale or distribution of other marital assets.</SPAN></P>

The court held that construing Act 271 to allow for gradual achievement of uniformity would be consistent with equitable principles of gradualism, traditional Equal Protection analysis, and statutory analysis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board denied the application because it was not shown that the proposed establishment was located within a resort area or that there was a necessity for an additional retail liquor license in the city where the establishment was to be located. Moreover, the proposed establishment was too close to other licensed establishments and to two churches. In addition, there was testimony that the quota of retail liquor licenses in the city had already been exceeded, that the existing licensed establishments adequately served the demand in the city, and that at least two liquor licenses were outstanding and available for purchase, although the brewery complained that they were too expensive and that one carried a &quot;stigma.&quot; The court affirmed, finding that the brewery failed to meet its burden under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 4-461(b) to show that the premises sought to be licensed were in a resort area and that there was an actual need for another license in the area, which was dispositive of the appeal.

Defendant argued that &sect; 9(a) of the Ordinance was unconstitutional because it was overly board and too vague. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 9(a) of the Ordinance was unconstitutionally broad because it forbid all street and sidewalk assemblies and gave local officials unfettered discretion in regulating the use of streets and sidewalks for assemblies. Such unfettered discretion was an unwarranted abridgement of defendant's First Amendments right of assembly. The court also held that &sect; 9(a) of the Ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because a person of common intelligence had to guess what the prohibited conduct was, thus violating defendant's due process rights. Moreover, The court noted that defendant was really arrested for suspected prostitution, not for loitering.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of her summary convictions for violating &sect; 9(a) of the Loitering Ordinance of the City of Reading, Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating the Ordinance when she and another female were standing on a corner waving at passing motorists and when she walked up to the passenger side of a car operated by a male motorist. Defendant argued that &sect; 9(a) of the Ordinance was unconstitutional because it was too broad and too vague. On appeal, the court agreed. The court found that &sect; 9(a) of the Ordinance was unconstitutionally broad because it forbid all street and sidewalk assemblies and gave local officials unfettered discretion in regulating the use of streets and sidewalks for assemblies. Such unfettered discretion was an unwarranted abridgement of defendant's First Amendment right of assembly. The court also held that &sect; 9(a) of the Ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because a person of common intelligence had to make a guess as to what conduct it prohibited, thus violating defendant's due process rights. Moreover, the court noted that defendant was really arrested for suspected prostitution, not for loitering. Because of the statute's failure to define the prohibited conduct, it was a dragnet that permitted the police to arrest, without probable cause, any undesirables.</SPAN></P>

The insurer reimbursed the insured for part of the damage. The insured filed an action for the unreimbursed damages and the insurer filed a subrogation action. The city filed preliminary objections to the subrogation claim. The objections were sustained. The Tort Claim Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8553(d), stated that a party could not recover in a tort claim against a municipality any amount which it had already received in benefits under an insurance policy. The insurer, as subrogee, could have no greater rights than the insured. Therefore, because the insured could not recover for the portion of his losses which were paid for by the insurer, neither could the insurer. The insurer was not a claimant within the meaning of &sect; 8553(d). The purpose of the Act was to limit damages to municipalities and it was to be so construed. The Act was not an unconstitutional impairment of the insurance contract because the contract was not in effect at the time the Act was passed. The effect of the Act on the insurer was not an illegal taking and did not violate its due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a pretrial application challenging the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's &quot;New Drunk Driving Law,&quot; Act of June 17, 1976, P.L. 162 (Pennsylvania).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of, among other things, the mandatory sentencing provisions of the Law, namely 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3735(a), 3731, and the per se .10 rule, under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(4), which permitted a conviction without additional evidence if a driver's blood alcohol content was .10 or more. Defendant also alleged that it was improper for the court to consider pre-January 14, 1983 offenses in applying the mandatory provisions of the Law. In dismissing defendant's pre-trial application, the court found no infirmities in the mandatory sentencing provisions of the Law; the provisions were a reasonable, rational, appropriate legislative attempt to address a most serious social problem. The mandatory sentencing provisions did not violate due process; punishment was in the purview of the Pennsylvania legislature. The court held that the per se rule in 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(4) was valid; other States had uniformly accepted the constitutionality of such a provision. Because the section under which defendant was charged read precisely as 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(1), so there was no due process violation.</SPAN></P>

Municipal Pension Ordinance, the spouse filed an action against defendants, the Board and the decedent's son, that sought judicial review of the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouse and the decedent were married for 8 months, although their relationship had lasted for 20 years. The Board denied pension benefits to the spouse under &sect; 211.1, which precluded a spouse from receiving pension benefits if he or she were married to a deceased employee for less than two years. On review, the spouse argued that the Board denied her the full and equal protection of the law by applying &sect; 211.1 to the facts of her case. The court held that the duration of marriage criterion as applied to the facts of the spouse's case lacked a fair and substantial relationship to the stated governmental objective of preventing collusive relationships. The court reasoned that the 8-month duration of the spouse's marriage was irrelevant given her continuous 20-year relationship with the decedent and that the governmental objective of preventing spurious claims was not advanced by precluding the spouse from obtaining ordinary death benefits. The court also reasoned that the application of the statutory classification to the spouse frustrated rather than furthered the aim of protecting dependent beneficiaries through a pension and retirement system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the Board to deny the spouse ordinary death benefits and affirmed the Board's decision to deny benefits to the son pending the spouse's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff group appealed from a decision of defendant township planning commission denying the group's application for a curative amendment to a township zoning ordinance governing construction of residential housing. The group asserted that the ordinance had an exclusionary effect because it failed to provide for the township's &quot;fair share&quot; of twin housing and imposed undue restrictions where such housing was permitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court evaluated three factors to determine if the ordinance effected an unconstitutional exclusion. First, the court determined that the township was a logical area for development and population increase. After evaluating the present level of development in the community without regard to whether flood plains, steep slopes, or rights of way rendered a particular site less suitable for development, the court accepted the township's percentage of total undeveloped land. Considering the vacant land in three districts where dwellings were permitted, the court determined that the township needed 711 dwelling units by the year 2000. Although twins, by definition, were only permitted in only one of the three districts, the court concluded that the number of additional dwelling units that could be accommodated statistically exceeded the projected demand. Lastly, because all of the township's potential housing needs could be met through construction of twins or multiple-family dwellings on the present vacant land, the court found no exclusionary result effect by the zoning scheme or exclusionary intent to zone out the natural growth of population.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the bus driver's counsel had been derelict in discovery methods and also had not complied with the requirements of Pa. R. Civ. P. 216 in requesting a continuance. The bus driver also alleged error in the exclusion of testimony of certain rebuttal witnesses, but the court found that the testimony merely contradicted the accident victim's cause of action but did not deny an affirmative fact that the accident victim hoped to prove. The court rejected the bus driver's employer's sovereign immunity challenge to punitive damages because municipal corporations were no longer immune from tort liability in Pennsylvania.

The court ordered the corporation to comply with the subpoena because when an administrative agency subpoenaed corporate books or records, the Fourth Amendment required that the subpoena be sufficiently limited in scope, relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that compliance was not unreasonably burdensome. The Agency had the right to conduct all reasonable inspection of documents that were contemplated by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 71, &sect; 307-2. The court found, among other things, that the subpoena issued by the agency clearly satisfied all the requirements necessary to establish its validity. The subpoena was sufficiently limited in scope in that it addressed only one particular action perpetrated by the corporation. The investigation was clearly relevant to the purpose for which Congress empowered the agency pursuant to &sect; 307-2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city through its fire code amended an ordinance to completely ban self-service gasoline stations within the city limits. The gas station owners and customers had petitioned for an adoption of an amendment to the ordinance allowing the self-service stations. When the city council failed to adopt the amendment this action attacking the constitutionality of the ordinance was instituted. The city contended that the ordinance was a proper exercise of its police powers for the protection of the public health and welfare. The court ruled that the city's ordinance was unconstitutional. The court found that the city's concern for a safety hazard was dispelled by the gas station owners' experts. This was not even a concern by the city council. The operation of self-service stations presented no greater risk of harm than full-service stations. The court found that the gas station owners had overcome their burden and established that the legislative act was improper. Even giving the city the benefit of applying the less restrictive test of any rational basis for the amended ordinance, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the city's ordinance banning self-service gasoline stations was unconstitutional and must be stricken. The court stayed its decree 180 days to permit the city to amend the ordinance in compliance with the court's adjudication. If the city took no action, then the court's decree was to take effect and it would issue an injunction enjoining the city from interfering with the operation of self-service gasoline stations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township sought to enjoin defendant individuals from dumping solid waste without a permit. The township filed a motion for summary judgment that alleged the dumping of solid waste violated the Solid Waste Management Act, 35 P.S. &sect; 6018.101 et seq. (1980) and the regulations promulgated thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals conceded that they had been dumping material defined as solid waste without a permit, but alleged that the Act was unconstitutional, that the depositing of solid waste without a permit did not constitute a public nuisance and that the township was barred by laches from proceeding. The court entered judgment for the township and enjoined the individuals from dumping solid waste without a permit. The Act provided that any violation of its provisions constituted a public nuisance. Therefore, dumping the waste without a permit was a violation of the Act. The individuals failed to meet the heavy burden imposed on them to show the Act was unconstitutional. There was no showing that the requirement of a permit placed an onerous burden on them or that the individuals were intentionally singled out for discriminatory enforcement. Mere passage of time was not enough to show laches. Where there existed a violation of the law or a continuing nuisance, the failure of the township to exercise its police power did not provide the individuals a right to continue or to estop the township from enforcing the law at any time the illegal action continued.</SPAN></P>

All parties filed preliminary objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended an accident occurred as a result of a malfunction of the automobile that the owner had purchased from the seller. The accident occurred upon a crossing of the company. The action was instituted by praecipe for writ of summons and all defendants responded by making preliminary objections. First, all defendants claimed the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for personal injuries, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5524(2). Under Pa.R.C.P. 1007, an action could be initiated by the filing of a praecipe and if such filing was timely, the statute of limitations would be tolled. Once such a writ was filed, a plaintiff was prohibited from delaying the action but the court found no such delay was created to bar the proceedings. Plaintiffs also made claims of breach of warranty and these were not affected by the personal injury statute of limitations. Demurrer by the seller was sustained because the seller could not be liable as it did not fall within the exceptions to &sect; 301 of the No-Fault Act, 40 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1009.301; however, the pleadings against the other defendants were sufficient to withstand demurrer.</SPAN></P>

The court found this issue was waived because defendant proceeded voluntarily to trial before a judge without objecting to a non-jury trial. Defendant also argued that his acquittal on the charge of simple assault by a jury invalidated his conviction on double jeopardy grounds. Though defendant was not entitled to automatic acquittal by merger based upon his acquittal on the misdemeanors and harassment was not a lesser offense of the misdemeanors, the court found that defendant was entitled to a single finder of fact on the issue of the alibi defense he presented at both non-jury trial on the summary offense of harassment and a jury trial on the misdemeanors as the charges grew out of the same incident.</SPAN></P>

The court held that that the guardian was authorized to consent to surgical procedures upon the incompetent, but that the decision whether to perform those procedures was left to the judgment of the attending physician, based on stated criteria. The court also declared Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6603(a) was unconstitutional because it was an invalid limitation upon the rights of the incompetent and the guardian.

The insured, in a motion for partial summary judgment, asserted that there was no marketable title during the pendency of litigation initiated by a third-party who claimed adverse possession pursuant to 12 P. S. &sect; 78 (1852).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the insured purchased insurance coverage on real property, a third-party commenced an action for adverse possession. However, the third-party's claim was held in valid. The insured claimed that it was entitled to damages because it did not have marketable title during that litigation, as guaranteed by the insurer's policy. The court denied both the insurer's motion for judgment on the pleadings and the insured's motion for partial summary judgment. Whether marketable title existed depended upon whether a prospective purchaser of the title, without the benefit of the hindsight of the other judgment, would have been subjecting himself to the hazards of litigation in which a third-party had a fairly probable likelihood of succeeding. The court concluded that it was not possible to whether there was marketable title during the adverse possession litigation. The court reasoned that even if a prospective purchaser had studied the third-party's claim and the statutory history of 12 P.S. &sect; 78 (1852), the prospective purchaser could not have determined the likelihood of success because whether the insured's real property constituted &quot;manorial&quot; land as used in &sect; 78 was in dispute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of defendant's conviction, the court noted that &sect; (e) of the Act of June 18, 1980, P.L. 223, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49Q2(e), required informational signs to be placed to allow drivers to avoid the restricted portion of the roadway, but specifically stated that the failure to post advance informational signs did not constitute a defense to violation of the statute. The court noted a rule that the constitutional requirement of definitiveness was violated by a criminal statute that failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by statute. The court concluded that the statute at issue was vague and indefinite as applied to defendant in that it did not furnish fair warning to defendant and thereby denied him his due process rights as guarantee by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

A piece of machinery called a shearer had been bolted to the floor in the welding shop. The school then moved the shearer to the air conditioning shop, but failed to bolt it to the floor. The student, who attempted to use the shearer to cut a piece of metal, was injured when the shearer toppled over. The school argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because it was immune from suit under the Act. The student contended that the shearer was &quot;real property,&quot; which constituted an exception to the Act's immunity. Although the court found that the Assembled Industrial Plant Doctrine did not apply to the shearer, it denied the school's motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that summary judgment could be granted only when the issue was free from doubt. The court found that the school continued to regard the property as a portion of the realty because it had planned to reattach it. Mere physical separation of an object from the real estate for some temporary purpose was not sufficient to change its character.

When called before a grand jury under the Investigating Grand Jury Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4541 et seq., defendants denied their actions and falsely testified that the mandated procedures had been followed. Defendants' preliminary motions were denied, which was affirmed upon appeal. Pursuant to the jury verdict, the trial court convicted defendants. Defendants moved for a new trial or arrest of judgment. The court denied the motions. Venue was proper because the conspiracy spread across the entire Commonwealth, and the central lottery computer was located within the county, an overt act was committed in the county that was connected to the theft by deception, criminal mischief, and rigging and conspiracy charges. The grand jury judge had properly directed the criminal proceedings to be held in that venue under the Investigating Grand Jury Act. The perjury count venue was also correct because it was so intertwined with the substantive offenses that joinder was required.</SPAN></P>

They sought compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that the municipality and authority were negligent in failing to provide proper security. The municipality filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, claiming that any duty to provide security was a public duty which could not be claimed by an individual. The parties conceded that a special relationship was necessary in order for the wife to claim that the municipality owned her a duty to provide security. The court determined that a special relationship existed because the wife was a business invitee. Therefore, the court concluded that the municipality was not entitled to the motion.</SPAN></P>

(Supp. 1981), but that the immunity was not retroactive. The city was not immune because the victim's cause of action arose before the Act's passage. For the city to have a duty beyond the public duty to provide security, a special relationship must have existed between the victim and the city. The court found that because the city had chose to render the services of the subway system, there was a special relationship.

Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 1311.706. Defendant alleged that &sect; 706 was unconstitutional because it was void for vagueness, because it shifted the burden of proof from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to defendant, and because it violated defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with failing or refusing to produce the head of a deer upon demand of a game law officer. He was found guilty and was fined. The court agreed with defendant's contention that &sect; 706 unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof from the Commonwealth to defendant. Defendant, as the accused in a criminal case, was clothed with a presumption of innocence. The Commonwealth had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty, and that burden never shifted. The court noted a case in which the forerunner of &sect; 706 had been found unconstitutional on the same basis. Because &sect; 706 presumed defendant to be guilty until he could prove his innocence, &sect; 706 obviously flew in the face of defendant's presumption of innocence and could not stand. The fact to be presumed in &sect; 706 was that the deer was killed unlawfully, and the presumption amounted to a shifting to defendant the burden of providing evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff aunt filed an action seeking support for her niece against defendant, the alleged father of the niece. The court considered the father's preliminary objections to the aunt's complaint and the aunt's answer thereto. The parties' dispute concerned the constitutionality of the six-year statute of limitations for civil child support actions set forth in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6704(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the aunt's complaint was barred by the six-year statute of limitations of &sect; 6704(e). The aunt argued that &sect; 6704(e) was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26 because it treated non-marital children differently than marital children. The court stated that while classifications based on illegitimacy were not subject to strict scrutiny, they were invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment if they were not substantially related to permissible state interests. The court concluded that the need of a child to receive adequate support outweighed the relation the statute of limitations might have to the prevention of fraudulent claims. The statute of limitations established by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6704(e) did not achieve the state's objective of avoiding stale claims. An arbitrary period of time could not insure the availability of proof of paternity within the child's first six years of life. Section 6704(e) created an impenetrable barrier to a non-marital child's right to support after six years and discriminated against non-marital children in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than five years after the child's birth, the mother filed an action against the putative father for support. The father sought judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the action was barred by the two-year limitation period for paternity actions. A dispute arose with regard to the constitutionality of the limitation period. The court denied the putative father's motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding that the limitation period violated the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibited classifications by the state based on illegitimacy unless the classifications were substantially related to a proper governmental purpose. No limitation was imposed on natural children that sought support from their fathers. To limit the right of illegitimate children to seek support was therefore a denial of equal protection. The concerns of preventing the litigation of stale and fraudulent claims had largely disappeared in light of scientific advancements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When buying a used vehicle, the purchasers entered into a Pennsylvania Retail Installment contract.

It was stipulated that the finance charge rate under the contract, computed on an add-on basis, was under 12 percent.

The court had to examine the statute in the light of the intent of the legislature and the evil sought to be remedied. The court, although bound by a decision of the appellate court, had a duty to point out issues that appeared to have been overlooked or misinterpreted, and stated that it did not feel that the omission of the word &quot;simple&quot; in the statute was determinative, particularly in view of the fact that it was also omitted in other statutes where the intent to limit interest to simple interest was clear.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued judgments for the minor and parents. The tire supplier appealed. The court held that (1) a new trial as to the tire supplier was proper because the tire supplier was liable as a manufacturer and the trial judge failed to submit the special interrogatories on special damages to the jury under Pa. R. Civ. P. 2257, (2) delay damages were proper under Pa. R. Civ. P. 238 because rule 238 did not violate the equal protection or substantive due process rights of the parties, (3) the tire supplier's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly denied because the evidence showed that the tire was defective and the lack of a warning caused the injuries, and (4) the tire supplier's motion for new trial was properly denied because expert witnesses were properly qualified, tests and subsequent accidents were properly excluded from the evidence, and the jury was properly instructed under the Pennsylvania Comparative Negligence Statute,&nbsp;42 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee filed a personal injury case against several parties, including defendant chemical company, which filed a complaint against additional defendant employer. The employer filed preliminary objections to the company's complaint, which alleged that it could not be joined in the case under &sect; 303 of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 481, or under the State's comparative negligence statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company alleged that &sect; 481 did not prohibit joinder of the employer if intentional misconduct was alleged and if an employee failed to file for workers' compensation benefits. The company also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 481 the ground that it violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, which concerned the subject matter of legislation. The court sustained the employer's preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. There would be no advantage to allow joinder of the employer under the comparative negligence statute because the employer's liability could be asserted as a defense at trial. The fact that the employee had not filed for workers' compensation was irrelevant with respect to the right of common law recovery against the employer, which could no be joined as an additional defendant despite the company's allegations of deliberate and intentional misconduct. Finally, the title of &sect; 303 of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act satisfied Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. It was sufficient to put persons of a reasonably inquiring state of mind on notice of the general subject matter of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant's objection to the interpreter was premature. The court also determined that the original complaint was dismissed to avoid procedural objections by defendant and that when the complaint was refiled a preliminary hearing was set within the time requirements of Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found it clear that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5322(a)(7)(iv) purported to give the Pennsylvania courts personal jurisdiction over all directors of all Pennsylvania corporations with respect to causes of action arising from their directorships. The directors contended that the statute was unconstitutional under a United States Supreme Court decision involving a Delaware corporation and its nonresident directors. Upon interpretation of that decision, the court found that it appeared that Delaware did not have a statute similar to &sect; 5322(a)(7)(iv), which specifically expressed the legislature's desire to make corporate officers amenable to suit, regardless of their residence. The Delaware law could have based personal jurisdiction solely on the fact that a defendant owned any property in Delaware. In &sect; 5322(a)(7)(iv), the legislature expressed the &quot;state interest&quot; that was lacking in the United States Supreme Court case. It seemed reasonable that a state should have jurisdiction over a person who had voluntarily accepted a directorship in an entity created by the state with reference to causes of action arising out of the directorship.</SPAN></P>

The shareholders conceded that the directors were non-residents but claimed that jurisdiction was obtained pursuant to Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 5322(a)(7)(iv). The court held that it was clear by its terms that &sect; 5322(a)(7)(iv) purported to give the Pennsylvania courts personal jurisdiction over all directors of all Pennsylvania corporations with respect to causes of action arising from their directorships. The court rejected the directors' claim that the statute was unconstitutional under a United States Supreme Court ruling in a case dealing with a Delaware corporation.

At issue was whether the Equal Rights Amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 28, required a woman to be equally liable for her husband's necessaries or whether instead it demanded that a man be equally not liable for his wife's necessaries. In denying the objection, the court held that when the husband was supplied with the necessaries of life, the wife was also benefited, and therefore, both were liable for them. The court adopted the rule that each spouse was primarily responsible for necessaries furnished himself or herself and was secondarily liable for those furnished to their marital partner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a petition to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 3926(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and the son argued that the wife failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could have been granted for the reasons that title to the property at issue was only in the name of the husband, individually, and was never in the name of the wife. In addition, the husband and the son argued that the conveyance was made prior to the effective date of the Divorce Code of 1980, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 101 et seq. In response, the wife argued that since her pre-Code action in divorce was pending when the conveyance was made, and since there was no apparent monetary consideration paid, the property was &quot;marital property&quot; subject to equitable distribution. On consideration of the issues, the court decided to sustain the preliminary objections. Specifically, the court held that because the Code did not take effect until after the transfer of the property in question, the husband had been free to transfer all of his interest in the property to whomever he wished. Accordingly, since the property was not subject to equitable distribution under the provisions of the Code, the court dismissed the wife's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband preliminarily objected to the request for equitable distribution claiming that all marital property was acquired by the parties, either individually or by the entireties, prior to the effective date of the Pennsylvania Divorce Code, July 1, 1980. Consequently, he asserted that, if applied, the Divorce Code would operate retroactively violating the state and federal constitutions. In overruling the objection, the court held that the husband did not carry the burden of proving that the Divorce Code was not constitutionally valid. The State could, in the exercise of the police power, enact a statute to promote the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Such a statute, because of retroactive application, could diminish or totally destroy a individual's right, whether in property or in contract, provided that the public interest to be promoted sufficiently outweighed in importance the private right that was impaired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his summary conviction for three violations of the Motor Boat Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 55, &sect; 483 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was boating on a lake when he was approached by two patrolmen of the Fish Commission (Pennsylvania). The patrolmen informed defendant that he was in violation of the Motor Boat Law and informed him that he could make a &quot;field acknowledgement&quot; of guilt in order to receive a lesser fine. Defendant did not timely respond to the Fish Commission, so he was summarily convicted. On appeal, defendant contended that the patrolmen's actions constituted prosecutorial misconduct and denied defendant several of his constitutional rights. In vacating defendant's summary conviction, the court held that the Fish Commission asserted judicial power that it did not possess; the sentencing of criminals was a judicial duty. The court also held that the use of &quot;field acknowledgements&quot; amounted to coercive and unfair bargaining techniques in regard to a summary defendant who was not protected by the usual constitutional safeguards attaching to plea bargains or guilty pleas. The procedure was so fundamentally unfair that defendant was denied his right to procedural due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's summary conviction and found defendant not guilty. Costs were assessed against a county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging that defendants, a city and some individuals, were liable thereunder for the acts of some city police offers. Those officers allegedly made an unlawful search of plaintiffs' residence and unlawfully restrained plaintiffs for an unreasonable period of time. The city filed preliminary objections, which the court overruled. The city filed a petition for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contended that it was immune from suit under the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 5311.101 et seq. The court disagreed, holding that the city was shielded only from causes of action which were derived under the common law and were enforceable only under state law. Thus, the court had to look to federal law. Federal case law stated that local governments were not wholly immune from suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. A local government could not be sued under &sect; 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employee or agents. Here, the question of whether the actions of the police officers represented official policy of the city was an issue of fact that could not be determined on the basis of pleadings. The court pointed out that the language of &sect; 1983 was absolute and unqualified; no mention was made of privileges, immunities, or defenses that could be asserted. Thus, Congress abolished whatever vestige of the state's sovereign immunity that the city possessed. Thus, the court held that the city could not assert the issue of good faith immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the city's preliminary objections. The court gave plaintiffs 20 days to file a more specific complaint after sustaining an objection filed by the individuals.</SPAN></P>

The court further concluded that the Board did not transcend the limits of its authority when it required the production of all leases in any appeal that involved commercial or industrial property that was subject to lease. The court found that the regulation in question, Regulation D of the Board of Assessment Appeals of Bucks County, Pa., had no constitutional infirmity. Owners of industrial and commercial property were not required to bear of the tax burden than other members of the same class, the equal protection rights of corporate taxpayers were not violated, and Regulation D was not a direct interference with the taxpayer's ability to engage in its profession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from a trial court (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of corruption of a minor, in violation of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6301, and indecent exposure, in violation of the Crimes Code, as amended, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3127. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that from the evidence adduced at trial, the jury could well have found that defendant touched or rubbed the vaginal area of an eight-year-and-eleven-month-old girl, kissed her on the lips and breasts, and rubbed his penis against the child's body. The evidence would also have supported a conclusion that defendant admitted the conduct. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in not sustaining his demurrers to the charges of corruption of a minor and indecent exposure as well as indecent assault. The court found that the evidence of guilt in the case was so overwhelming that any possible error in regard to the indictment had to be deemed harmless. The court found that the statute under which defendant was convicted was a valid exercise of police power. The court concluded that the district attorney's remark was isolated and was not part of a much longer harangue. Although it presented a close question, the court did not believe that one brief reference to the personal experience of a jury constituted an emphasis to the degree necessary to pose a danger of jury inflammation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff wife filed a complaint in divorce seeking an equitable distribution of marital property, alimony, support, alimony pendente lite, counsel fees, costs, and expenses in addition to divorce on the grounds of indignities to the person and irretrievable breakdown, as permitted under Pennsylvania Divorce Code of 1980, defendant husband filed preliminary objections. The husband argued that portions of the Code were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed a complaint in divorce against the husband, and the husband filed preliminary objections. The court dismissed the objections. Because of the public importance of the questions, the court held that they could be heard by way of preliminary objections. Even if &sect; 102(6) of the Code contemplated a retroactive taking of vested property, it was a valid exercise of police power. It was in the public interest to effectuate economic justice by recognizing the contribution of the wife in the acquisition of marital property by awarding her an equitable share of the marital property. Section 401 of the Code was not vague, uncertain, ambiguous, or otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The words &quot;equitable distribution&quot; directed that the court apportion the marital assets in a manner that would be just to the parties under all the circumstances. The marital relationship was a contract subject to the State's police power, and the equitable distribution provisions of the Code did not unconstitutionally impact on the contractual relationships between a spouse and third parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether or not the testimony elicited at a hearing was sufficient to justify the commitment of the patient to a state operated facility. At the hearing it was determined that the patient was mentally retarded, suffered from severe obesity, and his weight posed an unquestioned danger to his health and could be fatal. While living with his parents, it had been impossible to control the patient's weight. Commitment was ordered. The court ordered temporary commitment to a state facility until a more satisfactory living arrangement was created. It found that the patient's obesity and inability to control his eating presented a clear and present danger to himself. The risk of injury had been demonstrated within 30 days of the hearing and was likely to continue for an indefinite period. While the court agreed that the county should develop and create a living arrangement that provided 24 hour supervision and attendant medical services for the patient, the court could not return him to his home, and no appropriate community living arrangement facility existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the patient temporarily confined to a state facility and directed the program to act in good faith to make every attempt to create a living arrangement that would provide 24 hour supervision and attendant medical services for the patient as soon as practicable.</SPAN></P>

The complaint had attached thereto an affidavit of probable cause, the substance of which was that both the patrolman and the chief of police viewed the films and magazines together, which upon applying contemporary community standards depicted patently offensive representations that lacked serious literary, artistic, political, educational, or scientific value. On instructions from the district attorney, the district justice did not see either the magazines or the films before she found probable cause and issued an arrest warrant. Defendant filed an omnibus pretrial motion to quash the information and arrest warrant, and to discharge him.

Further, the court held that defendants were not the focus of any investigation designed to protect any animals, birds, or other game. The court granted the motion in arrest of judgment and denied the motion for a new trial, concluding that unlawful interference with duty under Pa. Stat.

Plaintiffs sought to hold the father liable under &sect; 301(a)(1) of the Act, P.L. 489, &sect; 301, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 1009.301, which made the owner of an uninsured vehicle vicariously liable for injuries caused by the operation of his uninsured vehicle. The father filed a demurrer to that part of plaintiff's complaint seeking to impose liability on him under &sect; 301(a)(1). In sustaining the demurrer, the court noted that plaintiffs' theory was that &sect; 301(a) created a form of liability before unknown to the state's law. The court found that &sect; 301(a) was intended to benefit individuals who abided by the terms of the Act by providing them with a partial shield from tort liability, and thus, the purpose of the exception in &sect; 301(a)(1) was simply to strip the owner of an uninsured vehicle of any immunity from tort liability he may have otherwise been afforded. However, the court held that, by removal of the shield, the legislature did not intend to allow a plaintiff to subject the owner of an uninsured vehicle to a new liability without reference to fault on the owner's part.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that in resolving a summary judgment request, the court should determine if there was any genuine issue as to a material fact which was essential to granting the requested judgment. Further, the court held that if such an issue existed then a summary judgment could not be granted and the matter must proceed to trial or hearing for a resolution of the disputed factual issue or issues. The court granted the commissioners' motion for summary judgment, concluding that the actions of the officers and the corporation were invalid, and that the position of the parties should be reinstated as it existed prior to the amendment of the articles of incorporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were the parents of four children. The children were absent and unexcused from school as the result of an extended Christmas vacation and a family trip. They were again absent as a result of a family trip. The school district excused that absence. Defendants requested that the children be given three more excused absences under the school districts educational trip policy. The school district denied the request, but defendants took the children from school. They were charged with violating the compulsory school attendance law of &sect; 13-1333 of the Pennsylvania School Code. They were convicted of the summary offense. The court found defendants guilty. It held that the school district's educational trip policy was not contrary to the Code or to the regulation of the State Board of Education. The school district's policy of limiting excused absences for educational trips was created to effectuate the compulsory education law. Because its rule advanced a legitimate compelling state interest, compulsory education, and was narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interest at stake, compulsory education, state regulation of defendants' rights was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The bus driver argued that the regulation relied on by the government agency was arbitrary and capricious. The court rejected this argument and noted that the regulation here was a valid exercise of judgment given to the government agency by the statutory scheme. Thus, the position taken by the government agency was not unreasonable. The court also noted that the disputed regulation did not go beyond the intent of the statute related to the qualifications for obtaining licenses. Finally, the presumption created by the statute at issue in this case was not constitutionally invalid because operating a vehicle was not a civil or property right but was a privilege, which was subject to such regulation and control that the state saw fit to impose.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 6704 did not retroactively apply because this was an unconstitutional revival of a liability that had expired. The court rejected the alleged father's arguments. The court pointed out that the previous law did not have a statute of limitations for the institution of a civil action for paternity. The court found that, although a paternity action under the Criminal Support Act was barred, a civil action under this law had never been barred, thus, the Commonwealth's civil cause of action never terminated before the enactment of the Civil Support Act. The court determined that the Civil Support Act could not be retroactively applied to withhold rights from persons who only recently acquired these rights, as such an application negated the very purpose of the legislature in creating an action for civil support.</SPAN></P>

However, following the convictions, defendant argued that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

On consideration of the issues, the court decided to deny defendant's motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. Specifically, the court held that the statute, which was a codification of the felony murder doctrine of the Pennsylvania common law, was not unconstitutional. Rather, the court noted that a defendant who willfully and ruthlessly planed and executed the arson of a dwelling house clearly exhibited the wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, and recklessness of consequences, which constituted the malice involved in the crime of murder. In addition, the court determined that statements by defendant to police were voluntarily made.

The owner argued that barroom nude dancing was a form of expression that was entitled to First Amendment protection and that &sect; 4-493(1) was unconstitutionally vague. In affirming the Board's decision, the court found that the business of dispensing alcoholic beverages was a privilege and an exercise of the state's police power. The owner had to comply with the conditions imposed by the state to operate under the privilege. When the owner accepted the imposition of the condition of no lewd entertainment as a condition of his license, he voluntarily acquiesced in the limitation of this right of freedom of speech and expression to the extent that the conduct was prohibited by the condition of his license.

The court heard the matter de novo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of violating Kidder Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 5.604(c), and that &sect; 5.604(c) was unconstitutional in that it violated defendant's First Amendment right of free speech. Section 5.604(c) indicated that zoning and building permits were required for the erection or alteration of any sign more than seven square feet in area. The court construed the language of the ordinance to require that permits had to be obtained by the person or persons actually erecting the sign. In the court's view, under the wording of the ordinance, a property owner without a permit who allowed or even directed the erection of a sign on his land but who did not actually participate in the erection of the sign did not violate this ordinance. The testimony in the instant case established beyond a reasonable doubt only that defendant permitted erection of the political sign in question on his own land but that he did not erect it or participate in the sign's erection. Such evidence was clearly insufficient to convict appellant under the wording of &sect; 5.604(c) of the offense charged.</SPAN></P>

The railroad also recorded certain radio communications with its train crews. The court dismissed the district attorney's preliminary objections. The court held that its equity jurisdiction extended to the control of the district attorney's prosecution under the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 et seq., where the railroad would be exposed to multiple improper prosecutions under the Act for which there was no adequate legal remedy. The railroad's claim under the Pennsylvania Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa. Cons.

The court concluded that the railroad's recordings did not violate the Wiretap Act where the employees were deemed to have given implied prior consent because they were notified of the recordings and knew when they were being recorded.</SPAN></P>

The company alleged that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5903(a) preempted the regulation of obscenity in the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality brought proceedings under its ordinance to enjoin the company from selling allegedly obscene materials. After the municipality had enacted its obscenity ordinance, the Commonwealth had enacted its obscenity law providing for criminal penalties and giving the court of common pleas injunctive powers. The court dismissed the municipality's complaint as moot and held as follows: (1) the municipality was without authority to regulate obscenity after passage of the Commonwealth's criminal obscenity statute; (2) nothing in the Commonwealth's obscenity law provided any authority for legislation or action by municipalities to regulate obscene literature or to aid in the enforcement of the state law by civil action; and (3) with the passage of a statewide criminal statute which failed to delegate cooperative powers to the various municipalities, actions to enjoin the sale of obscene or lewd material had been preempted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, including the imposition of penalties and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The county sought to collect the penalty for the decedent's failure during her lifetime to file property tax returns for four years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent did not file a personal property tax return for the four years preceding her death. Following her death, the county assessed the tax for each of those years. The executors paid all of the taxes due with interest. However, they refused to pay the 12 percent penalty that the county sought to collect. The court held that the Personal Property Tax Law of 1913 (Pennsylvania) authorized the collection of personal property taxes by counties from their residents. Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 4844 authorized the county to collect a 12 percent penalty for the failure to file a return. However, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 4844.2, which dealt with the assessments and collection of personal property taxes from the estates of decedents, limited the county to only taxing the property of a decedent which should have returned by him plus interest without the 12 percent penalty applicable to living taxpayers. Thus, the assessment of a penalty against the estate was not authorized by law. The court analyzed the legislative history of &sect; 4844.2 and determined that there was a clear intent to treat a decedent's estate differently that living persons for purposes of the 12 percent penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that certain estate proceedings were held and that an auditing judge held that certain legacies were invalid under the Mortmain statute because the testator died within 30 days of the execution of his will. Over 30 years later, the legatees filed exceptions to the adjudication on the basis that the Mortmain statute was declared unconstitutional. The court determined that the claim was barred by res judicata. The court stated that a certain fund was not a new or separate fund but that instead, it was part of the corpus of the estate that was awarded to intestate heirs in the earlier proceedings. The court noted that the earlier proceedings were uncontested for 35 years and that the legatees had received actual notice of the estate audit. The court held that the record showed that some members of an attorney general's staff had knowledge that the gifts to the charities were ruled invalid. The court determined that a deputy attorney general entered an appearance in the matter, that the auditing judge's order was voidable by the attorney general, and that the attorney general's failure to file exceptions stamped the proceedings with his approval.</SPAN></P>

The tenant filed a motion for partial summary judgment and for consolidation of the two cases. The court granted both motions and held that the landlord could not claim that the apartment was abandoned because his initial reason for the distraint was nonpayment of rent.

The father filed an answer that denied the grounds alleged by the mother petitioner and further claimed that the petition violated the legislative intent of the Act because it did not contain an averment that adoption proceedings with respect to the child were contemplated. The father moved to dismissed the petition. The court dismissed the petition and held that the conditions laid out in the Act were justified by appropriate state interest which bore a real and substantial relationship to furthering governmental ends. The court noted that equal protection guarantees did not require the state to treat all persons identically. Rather, it sought to ensure equality of right by forbidding arbitrary discrimination between persons similarly situated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents sued defendant school districts for themselves and affected pupils and sought an injunction and money damages. The parties agreed that an injunction was not needed because the school districts were providing the transportation required by the Public School Code of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended by the Act 372 of December 29, 1972, P.L. 1726, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 13-1361. The school districts requested summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute required school districts to provide free transportation to students attending nonpublic schools. The school districts earlier claimed that the statute was unconstitutional. After the statute was declared constitutional, the school districts began providing transportation. The parents sought reimbursement for their transportation costs for five years. The court found nothing to suggest an intention to create a private cause of action for damages. The court added that the parents did not show that the remedy provided in the Act of October 21, 1965, P.L. 601, &sect; 57 of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 25-2543, was ineffective in achieving the purpose of the statute mandating free transportation. The court found no private remedy intended by the legislature anywhere in the Pennsylvania Public School Code that enabled the parents to sue for reimbursement for transportation costs. The court noted that the judiciary was more willing to infer private causes of action where equitable relief was sought than where money damages were sought. The court explained that damages often involved harsher results and, thus, indicated a complex balancing of interests best left to the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the school districts' motion for summary judgment. The court dismissed the parents' complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judgment creditor entered a final default judgment rendered in its favor in Oklahoma to enforce that obligation against defendant judgment debtor in Pennsylvania. The judgment entered against the debtor as an individual doing business as a company, and he made a motion to strike and/or open the judgment on the ground that it was void as entered without jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor's company consulted with local manufacturer's representatives to have the creditor manufacture a custom product but suspended payments because of alleged deficiencies in the resulting product. The debtor claimed that Oklahoma, as a state and polity, had no jurisdiction of the matter, but he did not appear to contest jurisdiction or to assert forum non conveniens or appeal from the judgment, which was rendered after due notice of the proceedings. Except for the transaction at issue, the debtor had no contacts with Oklahoma. The court found that the critical problem was the absence of the debtor's permanent presence in Oklahoma and that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would have rejected a due process attack based on the &quot;active purchaser&quot; doctrine. The foreign judgment was presumptively entitled to Full Faith and Credit because it was rendered after notice and a proceeding in a sister state's court of record, the regularity of which was not challenged. On that limited basis, the court sustained the obligation of the judgment and denied the motion.</SPAN></P>

The employee sustained injuries in the collision, and she filed an action to recover damages. The employer and the co-employee filed a motion for summary judgment, and the operator filed a brief in opposition. The driver argued that the Workmen's Compensation Act (Pennsylvania) was unconstitutional in so far as it granted the employer immunity. On review, the court found that the Act granted and employer immunity from suit and barred its joinder as an additional defendant where an employee sued the third party for injuries sustained in the course and scope of his employment. The court held that the employees were in the course of their employment when the accident occurred. The court determined that the employer and the co-employee could be joined under the Pennsylvania comparative negligence act because it was apparent that the parties were necessary to the action if the operator was to have an accurate determination of his comparative negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority, which was vested with the power of eminent domain, condemned a portion of land that included the trailer park where the residents lived. The authority assumed the operation of the trailer park from the trailer park managers, who had orally promised the residents that they were permitted to live there as long as they paid rent. In response to the authority's notice to vacate the premises, the residents filed an action that sought damages under the Pennsylvania Eminent Domain Code of 1964, 26 P.S. &sect; 1-101 et seq. (Code). The court held that the authority failed to provide the residents with notice of condemnation, which could have been accomplished via a written letter or a visible sign on the premises, in violation of due process laws, and therefore, placed the residents in a protected class under the Code because they were legal occupants of the premises, and therefore, held a valuable property right. The court held that because the residents occupied the premises on the date when notice of condemnation was served upon them and had no comparable place to relocate, they had a right to the legal remedy of displacement damages calculated from that date.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.

Moreover, the MVISC itself provided that the Commercial Code would govern it. The Uniform Commercial Code, 13 Pa. Cons. Stat.

The court found that Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, president of a corporation, appealed his summary conviction from a district justice (Pennsylvania) for knowingly and intentionally failing or refusing to pay the amounts necessary to provide benefits for several employee union funds in violation of &sect; 11.1 of the Wage Payment and Collection Law of July 14, 1961, Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, corporation president, was convicted for knowingly and intentionally failing or refusing to pay the amounts necessary to provide benefits for several employee union funds. Defendant claimed it had not been demonstrated that he had the necessary criminal scienter to hold him criminally responsible for his failure to satisfy the fringe benefits of the parties in interest and argued the debts represent dischargeable debts under the federal laws and regulations. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentenced him to pay the costs of prosecution and a fine for each of the offenses charged. The court ruled that the criminal proceeding was not barred by the bankruptcy proceedings involving the corporation and held that the penalty was properly imposed under the statutory law despite defendant's lack of criminal intent since the legislature had the authority to define a crime so that proof of criminal intent or guilty knowledge was not necessary. The court refused to impose restitution as part of the sentence in view of the potential personal liability which such an order would create for certain corporate officers, without an requirement of complicity in the violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district justice's summary conviction and found defendant guilty of the offenses charged against him for knowingly and intentionally failing or refusing to pay the amounts necessary to provide benefits for several employee union funds. Defendant was sentenced to pay the costs of prosecution and a fine of $ 100 on each of the two offenses charged.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers brought an appeal from the imposition of the tax ordinance on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional as being in violation of the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa.

Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6901, et seq. The court ruled that the imposition of the tax for disparate periods of time in the initial year of imposition resulted in a difference in the tax rate applied to taxpayers whose income was earned as opposed to those who realized net profits, which constituted a constitutionally repugnant lack of uniformity. The court decreed that the taxes as imposed for the initial year of imposition were void, and that the imposition of the taxes for all subsequent years was valid, concluding that the imposition of the tax for the initial tax year of was in violation of the Uniformity Clause of Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under pseudonyms the anonymous asbestos industry worker, who had asbestosis, and his wife accused the manufacturers of having wrongfully allowed their asbestos exposure.

One of the manufacturers was an English corporation and asserted that the court lacked personal jurisdiction in this matter. Under Pa. R. Civ.

The court granted the worker, his wife, and the English corporation leave to submit affidavits concerning that matter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother filed a complaint for support on behalf of her nonmarital child. Defendant putative father contested paternity, and filed a petition to dismiss the paternity proceedings. The mother's suit was filed pro se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the suit had been pending for approximately six months, the trial judge sent her a certified letter threatening to enter a compulsory non-suit if she did not prosecute the suit. No action was taken and no such order followed, however, the mother caused a criminal action to be filed against the father. The criminal action was dismissed sua sponte for over two years' inactivity. The father argued that lapse of the statute of limitations on criminal determinations of paternity barred any civil suit for failure to support. The court disagreed, holding that although under case law the civil action could not have been maintained absent a waiver or admission if the criminal statute of limitations had expired, the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1952 (1972), saved the new procedure for determining paternity. That procedure under the Civil Procedural Support Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 62, &sect; 2043.31 et seq. was amended, effective June 27, 1978, to provide a civil cause of action with a six-year statute of limitations. Even though it had a curious status as an amendment to a repealed statute, the new procedure for determination of paternity was validly effective.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the statute's classification of marijuana as a controlled substance was irrational and arbitrary under the Equal Protection Clause. In considering defendant's motion, the court found that defendant's medical witnesses claimed that marijuana had medicinal qualities, while the Commonwealth's witnesses disagreed. The court held that defendant had no standing to question the statute on the medicinal quality ground because he did not claim that he used the drug for a medicinal purpose. In denying defendant's motion, the court held that marijuana had a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. The court found that defendant failed to show that the basis for classifying marijuana as a controlled substance was irrational or arbitrary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were subscribers to the insurer's dental services program, which essentially provided for an agreed upon fee system. The insurer had audited plaintiffs and determined that plaintiffs were charging a higher fee that permitted by the contract between the parties. Plaintiffs took exception to the audit, asserting that it involved a nonrepresentative percentage of their uninsured patients and that an improper standard was used. The court found that the insurer's bylaws and regulations spoke specifically to the matter involved and that the contractual agreements, along with statutory requirements, imposed an exclusive remedy for settling disputes such as brought forth by plaintiffs. The court held that where such a remedy was provided by statute, it was the exclusive remedy and equitable relief was not available.

The court disagreed. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the state police did not need probable cause to stop defendant because the act of stopping was nonarbitrary, where all trucks were stopped, and because the public interest in the prevention of injury to public property and the safety of persons traveling on the road outweighed the potential interference with Fourth Amendment rights; (2) the Commonwealth's action did not constitute an unconstitutional infringement on defendant's rights; and (3) the weighmaster was qualified to weight the truck because under &sect; 4981(a) of the Vehicle Code, Pa.

The creditor contended that it was entitled to judgment by confession without such an affidavit. On the creditor's motion, the court issued an order making the rule absolute. The court held that it was not bound by a United States District Court opinion mandating certain procedures, which were implemented by the prothonotary, in the confession of judgment where the United States Supreme Court did not affirm the District Court's judgment on the merits. The court held that the entry of judgments by confession were constitutionally valid where notice of the judgment was provided to the debtor along with an opportunity to be heard and to raise defenses prior to any judicial sale on the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's gift of the residuary estate to his wife lapsed because she pre-deceased him. Thus, that portion of his estate was subject to distribution under the intestate laws. The claimant contended that she was entitled to inherit as the decedent's brother's illegitimate child. The decedent's sister argued that the claimant could not legally inherit because of her illegitimacy. The court was presented with a petition to determine the claimant's standing. The court found in favor of the claimant. The court found that the decedent and his brother died long before the effective date of 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2107 (1972), which removed the bar against inheritance by illegitimate children from or through the father under certain conditions. The decedent died after the United States Supreme Court declared that statutes that barred an illegitimate child from inheriting were unconstitutional. As a consequence, the court held that the claimant should be permitted to present evidence in support of her claim as an illegitimate child of the decedent's brother. In so doing, in order to prevail, she was required to establish proof of her relationship by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A will created testamentary trusts, with life interests to annuitants and the principal to the charities. Upon the death of each life annuitant, accounts were filed and audited, with adjudications by the trial court. In the first audit, the court adjudged that the charitable bequests failed under the Mortmain Statute, &sect; 7(1) of the Wills Act of 1947. The court awarded the principal of the trust to the intestate heirs of the testator, with the exception of a sum retained to secure the payment of the annuities. The charities had notice of the audit. On the death of the last annuitant, the accountant filed its account. The charities filed claims to the residue, on grounds that the Mortmain Statute had been declared unconstitutional. The court disallowed the claims and entered a decree that the account was confirmed nisi. The court held that the prior audit had the effect of res judicata as to the charities' claims. The entire corpus was awarded, subject only to the equitable charge of the annuities. The fund held to secure the annuities was not a separate fund awaiting determination. Thus the declaration that the statute was unconstitutional did not affect the fund's distribution.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff challenged his purported removal from the water authority board by the council and his replacement by the appointee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council appointed plaintiff to serve as a member of the water authority board. Plaintiff was elected to a seat on the council. The council declared plaintiff's water authority board seat vacant, removed him, and replaced him with the appointee. Plaintiff filed a complaint in quo warranto and mandamus, and moved for peremptory judgment in mandamus. Defendants filed answers and preliminary objections. The court held that (1) mandamus, not quo warranto, was the appropriate action on the issues of the legality of plaintiff's ouster and his reinstatement; (2) the authority granted to the council under &sect;&sect; 903, 904 of the Borough Code of 1966, Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was not given proper notice under &sect; 8 of the Ordinance, as notice was given to his wife by a police officer and he was named as defendant.

The court found defendant not guilty and held that the Ordinance was unconstitutional. In so holding, the court found that the presumption shifts the burden to defendant to prove that the vehicle was not abandoned and was in disregard of the constitutional protections that all men are innocent until proven guilty, the Fifth Amendment protection that no man could be compelled to testify against himself, and the requirement that the Commonwealth was required prove every element beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered defendant's pre-trial application seeking dismissal of the charges against him for violating Allentown, Pa., Noise Ordinance No. 12356, &sect; 719.04(b)(4). Defendant contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the magistrate committed fatal error by requiring him to post more bond than the summons specified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited owning, possessing, harboring, or controlling any animal or bird that made noise continuously for 10 minutes or intermittently for one-half hour or more. The magistrate convicted defendant after a hearing. Defendant appealed and sought pre-trial relief, which the court denied. The constitutionality of the ordinance was presumed, giving defendant the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. The ordinance violated due process if it prohibited or required an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence necessarily guessed at its meaning and differed as to its application. Defendant failed to show that the ordinance was vague or overbroad. The ordinance, which required that noise be such as to offend a reasonable person and to continue for specific lengths of time before one could be held accountable for violation, withstood a constitutional attack. The court conceded that the magistrate erred by requiring defendant to post excess bond but declined to dismiss the conviction. The prompt refund of the excess bond after the conviction corrected the error, and the mistake did not abridge defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife brought an action against her husband for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle collision. The wife claimed that the husband voluntarily left their marital residence after the accident and that his departure constituted abandonment. The husband objected to the complaint, arguing that the action was barred by interspousal immunity under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 111. The court dismissed the preliminary objections. The court rejected the husband's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it created a cause of action in a wife and not in a husband. The court held that under 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2301(a) (1978), the legislature intended to interpret statutes which limited a right to a single sex to refer to both sexes. Thus, in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 114 (1913), the right of a deserted or abandoned wife to bring an action also included the right of a deserted or abandoned husband. Because the wife alleged abandonment in her complaint, she appeared to fall within the scope of the abandoned wife or spouse exception to interspousal immunity.</SPAN></P>

The court enjoined the district attorney from prosecuting the organization. The court found that in order to establish an allegation of discriminatory enforcement it was necessary to prove that the enforcement contained an element of intentional discrimination. It was apparent from the stipulations that the district attorney did not screen complaints and that no prosecutorial discretion was exercised once complaints were received. The system of prosecution used by the district attorney allowed illegal discriminatory and selective enforcement. The court also found that it was proper to enjoin the criminal prosecution because the organization did not seek a determination of guilt, it challenged the constitutionality of the statutes in question, and there was a reasonable probability of irreparable harm.</SPAN></P>

However, the elapsed time between arrest and trial was 317 days in violation of Pa. R. Crim. P. 1100. Following defendant's conviction, the court informed counsel of the existence of the serious constitutional issue of speedy trial rights and requested briefs. The commonwealth moved for the recusation of the court. The court denied the commonwealth's motion and set aside defendant's convictions. Because the court convicted defendant in a nonjury trial, it was evident that the court was not biased or prejudiced against the commonwealth. The delay between defendant's arrest and the certification to try him as an adult was attributable to the commonwealth, and the juvenile court's jurisdiction did not toll the running of Rule 1100. There was no reason not to include children within the ambit of the right to speedy trial. A boy in custody, regardless of his status under the criminal law, was entitled to the educational rights of all children. Thus, the separate classification of certified juveniles by refusing to provide them schooling violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

The Commission filed objections to the complaint and claimed that sovereign immunity applied and that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Board of Property had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. The court sustained the objections and ordered the matter transferred to the Board for further action. The court held that 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2310 indicated that sovereign immunity was viable except in those specific instances where it was waived by the legislature. In the present action where title to land was involved there was a specific waiver of immunity. Pursuant to the Act of April 9, 1929, P.L 177, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 71, &sect; 337 the Board had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute centered around title to land. The court held that a precedential decision cited by the owner did not take case out of sovereign immunity area because the owner sought to compel affirmative acts on the part of the Commission and did not claim that a statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the requirement to be shown before a grand jury was convened was provided in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 267(b), but defendants' claim was moot because the Commonwealth agreed to grant defendants a preliminary hearing. The court held that the judiciary still controlled the investigating grand jury pursuant to &sect;&sect; 3, 6, and 9 of the Grand Jury Act of 1978. The court also determined that the Act did not prohibit a judicial district from proceeding by indictment or information and that an investigating grand jury was allowed to issue an indictment. The court finally held that the Act merely permitted different investigations to proceed in different jurisdictions which did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) Investigating Grand Jury issued indictments against defendants charging each with murder, arson, causing catastrophe and conspiracy, defendants moved that the court quash the indictments alleging that the grand jury was unconstitutionally convened. The matter was continued to permit counsel to submit briefs and prepare for oral argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the alteration of the decisional standards relating to the right to convene a special investigating grand jury by the Pennsylvania Investigating Grand Jury Act of November 22, 1978, Pa. P.L. 1148, No. 271, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 265 et seq., as amended, did not violate the Pennsylvania Constitution. The word &quot;shall&quot; had to be interpreted as conferring discretion upon judges. As it was plain that the president judge had discretion with respect to impaneling an investigating grand jury, it was similarly plain that the supervising judge maintained his former control over it. The ability of the supervising judge to protect the rights of witnesses and those accused before the grand jury was in no way abridged by the act. Were indictments quashed on a technical ground, they could properly be re-issued as presentments, which the act, as amended, allowed, so defendants suffered no harm. The act merely permitted criminal investigations to proceed in forums having different jurisdictions, but the substantial rights of an accused were equal. The contention that proceeding by county investigating grand jury denied defendants the equal protection of the law was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney general sought to modify an order of the court in a malpractice case, which approved a settlement and which, subject to a final determination, authorized the customary attorney's fee to respondent attorney for a minor of one-third of the recovery, instead of the smaller amount permitted by the Pennsylvania Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1301.101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney represented a minor in a malpractice action. The court approved a settlement and authorized the customary attorney's fee in minor's cases of a third of the settlement. The Administrator of the Arbitration Panels for Health Care declined to approve the settlement because the attorney's fee award was not in conformance with the 30 percent or less permitted under 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1301.604. The attorney general sought to modify the court's order to have the difference paid to the minor's guardian. The attorney mounted a full scale constitutional challenge to the limitation. The court found in favor of the attorney. The court held that by virtue of the Act of June 21, 1937, P.S. 1982, as amended by 17 Pa Cons. Stat. &sect; 61, any Act of Assembly inconsistent with a Rule promulgated by the Supreme Court was suspended. Accordingly, 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1301.604 to the extent that it purported to limit contingent fees in a case of a minor plaintiff, was in conflict with Pa. R. Civ. P. 2039(b) and was therefore suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding the Malpractice Act suspended as inconsistent with the rule vesting minor's compromises exclusively in the Court of Common Pleas, the court denied the petition to modify the order of the court as to attorney's fees. The court directed that the balance of the fee then in an escrow account to be remitted to the attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband filed preliminary objections to plaintiff wife's petition seeking an order restraining the husband from abusing her and their children under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 10181.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband asserted that &sect; 10181 allowed for the taking of property without a jury trial, just compensation, or due process of law. The husband asserted that &sect; 10181 was vague and indefinite and that it amounted to an ex post facto law. The court determined that the Protection From Abuse Act, including its sanctions and objectives, did not offend due process. The sanctions imposed by the act bore a real and substantial relationship to its stated objectives. These objectives were to provide for remedies and procedures relating to abuse of adults or children by a person who was a member of the family or household. The court found that the restrictions that the act placed on the use of property to protect abused spouses and children were necessary to dispel the dangers of domestic violence. In doing so, they violated no constitutional mandate against the taking of property. The court reasoned that a temporary denial of use to one who had allegedly perpetrated an anti-social act of abuse on another member of the family did not in and of itself make the act repugnant to the Constitution. The court further found that the Act was clear and did not constitute ex post facto legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the husband's preliminary objections and set the wife's petition for a final hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence in support of both of his post-verdict motions. The court held that the evidence revealed that defendant had been drinking both whiskey and beer prior to the accident. When the police arrived at the scene of the fatal accident, they discovered several empty beer cans just outside the cab of the truck. The difficulty defendant experienced in driving his truck immediately before the accident as well as the occurrence of the fatal accident itself provided additional and sufficient evidence to the jury that defendant was under the influence of alcohol to such an extent that he was incapable of safe driving. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to convict defendant of violating 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that defendant's violation of section &sect; 3731 was the proximate cause of the fatal accident that killed defendant's passenger. The court concluded that the homicide by vehicle statute was constitutional and that defendant's points for charge requesting instructions concerning mens rea were properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite the objections of the creditor, the court decided to rule on the debtor's petition. The court held that the debtor had been deprived of a significant property interest. A writ of attachment was issued on praecipe to the prothonotary on rather conclusory allegations. The court held that under Pa. R. Civ. P. 1291(a), the debtor had the right to immediately move to dissolve the attachment and to test the sufficiency of the allegation upon which the writ was issued. Therefore, the debtor had the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time, in a meaningful manner. The debtor chose not to follow the procedures of the rules themselves, but to wait the better part of a year to contest the legality of the proceedings. The court noted that proof of prejudice was a necessary element to make a due process claim ripe for adjudication. The court concluded that the debtor still had the right to file a motion to dissolve the attachment under Pa. R. Civ. P. 1291(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition was presented pursuant to the Juvenile Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 333, &sect; 1, Pa. Stat.

The parents signed a consent decree that allowed the children to be placed in a foster home. Subsequently, counsel for the children was appointed who, with Children Services, sought to examine the parents, who had filed a petition for the return of their children to their home. The petition was opposed on the grounds that the parents were not able to provide minimal care. The parents' counsel opposed the examination on grounds that it would violate their right to privacy as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The court found that (1) Pa. R. Civ. P. 1040 did not apply to cases brought under the Juvenile Act; (2) there was no invasion of privacy because there was no doctor-patient privilege at issue; (3) the parents put their ability to parent at issue by seeking the children's return; and (4) the request was reasonable because the state was a proper interested party that had a vital interest in the protecting the children's welfare.</SPAN></P>
