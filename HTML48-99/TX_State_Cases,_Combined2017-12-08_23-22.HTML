</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed a motion for rehearing en banc of the court's prior opinion, which reversed the judgment from the District Court of Williamson County, 277th Judicial District (Texas) convicting appellant of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction for murder was previously reversed by the court. The court granted the state's motion for rehearing en banc. The court's prior decision that the district court did not have jurisdiction because there had been no formal change of venue was withdrawn. The error was a procedural one, rather than jurisdictional as construed by the court in its original opinion. Thus, it was not a fundamental error and was not preserved for review. Accordingly, the court withdrew its prior decision and reviewed the points of error originally raised. Appellant was not denied due course of law when his motion for new trial was not heard. Appellant did not satisfy the two-pronged test for ineffective assistance of counsel. There was no error in allowing testimony of the victim's statements regarding her relationship with appellant because it fell within the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule, and its admission was harmless because appellant failed to object to similar evidence. There was no error in admitting evidence alleged to have been illegally seized because appellant had elicited evidence of the search first. Accordingly, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the state's motion for rehearing en banc, withdrew its previous opinion, and substituted it for this one because the unassigned error upon which the court previously reversed appellant's conviction was a procedural error. Therefore, it was not a fundamental error and was not preserved for review. Upon rehearing, the court affirmed appellant's conviction, having found no merit with the points of error raised by appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the 54th District Court, McLennan County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated assault, arguing that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the prosecution's peremptory challenges and erred in denying discovery of an arresting officer's personnel file to support his claim of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers witnessed defendant driving erratically and, believing he was intoxicated, attempted to stop him. When an officer reached into the car to take the keys out of the ignition, defendant hit the accelerator, dragged the officer down the street, and eventually ran him over. Defendant was charged with and convicted of aggravated assault. He appealed the judgment of conviction, arguing that the prosecution exercised peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner and that he was improperly denied discovery of Brady materials. On review, the judgment of conviction was affirmed, as the prosecution offered appropriate race-neutral explanations for its challenges and defendant failed to establish that such explanations were mere pretext. Although the trial court erred in concluding that evidence of prior misconduct by the officer was subject to disclosure only if substantiated and erred in precluding discovery of material information favorable to defendant's claim of self-defense, reversal was not required where there was no reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, as the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's objections to the prosecution's peremptory challenges where the prosecution offered valid, non-discriminatory reasons for such exercise. Further, although the trial court erred in failing to permit discovery of material impeachment information, reversal was not required where disclosure would not have affected the proceeding's outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a decision of the County Criminal Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of the misdemeanor offense of promotion of an obscene device in violation of Tex. Pen. Code &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An undercover officer purchased a clitoral stimulator from appellant. He later returned with other officers and confiscated other obscene merchandise from appellant's shop. Appellant was convicted of promotion of an obscene device in violation of Tex. Pen. Code &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (1994). The court affirmed finding the state could deny access to obscene devices. The court held the obscene devices were not speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The court found appellant's motion to quash the information was untimely. The court found the trial judge did not have to make a determination that the clitoral stimulator was obscene before issuing a warrant. The court held the plain view doctrine applied to items seized prior to the issuance of a warrant. The court found there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of extraneous evidence relevant to appellant's intent and knowledge concerning the character of the obscene device. The court held the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the definition of obscenity because that term was defined in the statute, thus, the jury was not required to make an independent determination that the device in question was obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction was affirmed because the statute was constitutional. Appellant's motion to quash the information was untimely. Because the legislature defined &quot;obscene device,&quot; the jury did not have to make a finding of obscenity. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence which was relevant to show appellant's intent and knowledge concerning the character of the device he sold to an undercover officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for driving while intoxicated in the County Criminal Court at Law No. 7, Harris County, Texas, on several grounds, including that there was no probable cause for his arrest and that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for driving while intoxicated on several grounds, including that there was no probable cause for his arrest. The court held that after an officer observed defendant speeding, the officer had probable cause to stop him pursuant to Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 543.001, 545.351, 545.352 (1998). After defendant admitted he had three beers and failed a subsequent field sobriety test, the officer had probable cause to take defendant to police headquarters. At headquarters, police made of videotape of defendant when he refused, after oral and written warnings, to take a breath test, all of which constituted probable cause for his arrest. The court also held that Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 724.061 (1998), which allowed introduction of evidence of a person's refusal to submit to the taking of a specimen of breath or blood, was not unconstitutionally vague and that conflicting inferences did not render the statute unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state challenged the order of the 220th District Court of Comanche County (Texas), which set aside an indictment of appellee on the charge of engaging in organized crime activity in connection with a burglary pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 71.01(a), 71.02(a)(1) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a previous indictment for engaging in organized criminal activity in connection with a burglary had been set aside, appellee filed a motion to set aside a new indictment for the same offense. The court reversed the order of the trial court setting aside the indictment pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 71.01(a), 71.02(a)(1) (1994). The indictment, which alleged one criminal activity, a single burglary, was not defective because the statute referred to plural activities. Organized criminal activity included a combination of persons carrying on &quot;one or more&quot; criminal offenses by engaging in either a single criminal activity or multiple activities. Setting aside the prior indictment ended that prosecution without determining issues on the merits. Thus, neither res judicata, nor collateral estoppel prevented refiling the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, having been arrested for possession of methamphetamine pursuant to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.115, applied for writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.001 et seq. was unconstitutionally vague, that it violated separation of powers, and that it allowed arbitrary prosecution. Appellant also claimed that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that the statute gave appellant sufficient notice of the prohibited conduct and was therefore not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the statute did not allow for arbitrary prosecution under either Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.115 or &sect; 481.129 because the two statutes did not address the same offense. The court determined that the Texas Controlled Substances Act did not improperly delegate legislative power to the executive branch because the commissioner could not change any controlled substance in the statute under which appellant was charged. The court concluded that the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct.</SPAN></P>

In order to qualify as a guard dog under the Act, a dog had to be sold for protective purposes. The ferocity or timidity of the dog and its ability to protect were irrelevant under the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the felony offense of driving while intoxicated and, in two enhancement paragraphs, was alleged to have previously committed two offenses of possession of a controlled substance. Defendant was convicted after entering a plea of not guilty to the offense and pleas of true to the allegations in the two enhancement paragraphs, and the trial court sentenced defendant to 25 years confinement. Defendant argued that his sentence was cruel and unusual under U.S. Const. amend. IX and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Defendant also claimed that Tex. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 49.04 and 49.11 were unconstitutional, and that the jury charge and the indictment were fundamentally erroneous because they failed to allege or require a culpable mental state. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Defendant could not complain that his punishment was cruel because he did not object timely and specifically at trial. Also, a culpable mental state was not required for the offense of driving while intoxicated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a criminal action, defendant appealed a judgment of the County Court at Law No. 2 of Bell County (Texas), which convicted him of telephone harassment under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of telephone harassment under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07 (Supp. 1998) for calling his victim at work and threatening to kill him. On appeal defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, that there was insufficient proof of criminal intent, and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal the court affirmed. Although defendant and his sister testified that defendant did not make a threat during the phone call, there was testimony by another witness to the call that a threat was made, which the trier of fact was free to believe. That testimony was also sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently defined telephone harassment as a threat, by telephone or in writing, to inflict bodily injury on the person, or to commit a felony against the person, a member of his family, or his property. Thus, the conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the decision, the court explained that a mother's use of drugs during pregnancy was conduct which endangered the physical and emotional well-being of her child. The court also held that, although parental rights were of constitutional magnitude, she had waived her challenge to the interpretation of Tex. Fam.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant putative father challenged an order of the County Court at Law No. 1, Webb County (Texas), which rendered a take-nothing judgment against appellant in his suit to establish paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A child was born during a marriage. When the couple divorced, the child was named as the couple's child in the divorce decree. Later, the couple reconciled and remarried. Appellant, the child's putative father, filed suit to establish himself as the child's biological father. In response, the couple alleged that the suit was barred because the divorce decree constituted a prior adjudication of paternity for the purposes of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 160.007(a)(1). After blood tests established that appellant was the child's biological father, the parties asked for a bench trial to determine whether &sect; 160.007(a)(1) barred the action. The trial court rendered a take-nothing judgment against appellant. Appellant sought review, but the appellate court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that &sect; 160.007(a)(1) did not violate appellant's rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 when it limited appellant's standing to the period before the husband was adjudicated the child's biological father. The court found that &sect; 160.007(a)(1) represented a reasonable means of promoting the state's legitimate interests in the finality of judgments and the stability of families.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of an order revoking community supervision. He alleged that he was not given credit on his sentence for the time he was incarcerated prior to the final revocation proceeding.

The court held that appellant would be granted credit on his sentence for the time he was incarcerated between his arrest on the revocation warrant and the imposition of sentence. Appellant argued that the trial court's denial of credit on his sentence for time incarcerated between his arrest on the revocation warrant and his sentencing after revocation of community supervision violated constitutional rights of due process and due course of law under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowner sought review of a decision from the 78th District Court of Wichita County (Texas), dismissing plaintiff's suit challenging an unfavorable property appraisal by defendant county on the ground that plaintiff's challenge to the appraisal was barred as being untimely filed after the delinquency date for payment of taxes had expired under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08(b)(1988).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowner challenged the trial court's dismissal of his challenge to a real property appraisal made by defendant county. The trial court held that plaintiff's suit was barred as untimely because it was filed after the date for payment of taxes had expired. On appeal, the court held that under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08(b)(1988) as interpreted by the state's highest court, plaintiff was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he had substantially complied with the statutory requirement of paying the assessed taxes before the delinquency date. If plaintiff had substantially complied, he would retain his right to challenge defendant's appraisal. The fact that plaintiff was financially unable to pay the taxes before the delinquency date did not render the trial court's dismissal harmless error because, at the time plaintiff's 1994 taxes became delinquent, the state legislature had not yet enacted the provision for filing an oath of inability to pay as required by Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08 (1996). The court reversed and remanded for a hearing to determine whether plaintiff had substantially complied with Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08(b)(1988).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate was indicted for delivery of cocaine and entered into a plea for community supervision and deferred adjudication. Subsequently, appellant was found in violation of his community supervision conditions and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Appellant contended that he was entitled to a new trial because he made a timely request for the statement of facts, the court' reporter's notes were lost through no fault of his, and the parties could not agree on the facts. The court held that appellant failed to make a timely request for the reporter's record. The only delay attributable to the lost reporter's record was the five months appellant waited. The court held that this was not an inordinate delay of the appellate process and did not deprive appellant of due process. The court further held that appellant entered his guilty plea freely and voluntarily because where the record was otherwise silent, the court presumed that there was a recital in the judgment relative to the voluntariness of a guilty plea. The trial court also had jurisdiction to revoke appellant's community supervision after it had expired because a capias was issued before the period had expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, holding that appellant inmate did not make a timely request for the reporter's record, he was not deprived of due process, he pled guilty freely and voluntarily, he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court properly denied appellant's motion for a new trial without a hearing, the trial court had jurisdiction to revoke his community supervision, and appellant failed to object to his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A grievance proceeding was filed against appellant by the state bar. Appellant then sought injunctive and declaratory relief against appellees, the state bar and the state bar's employees. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's complaint. The court held that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. The court held that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear appellant's claims because it would have interfered with a pending grievance proceeding filed against appellant. The court also held that the state bar was entitled to governmental immunity as to appellant's claims. The court held that the state bar did not waive said immunity. The court also held that the sovereign immunity extended to the state bar's employees because they were sued as individuals in their official capacities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In appellee property owners' suit for damages arising out of an explosion at appellant pipeline companies' underground storage facility, appellants sought review of an order of the 55th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which found that all appellants were negligent, grossly negligent, acted with malice, proximately caused appellees' damages, created a permanent nuisance, and awarded punitive damages for past and future mental anguish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee property owners sued appellant pipeline companies after an explosion occurred at appellants' storage facility. The trial court found that appellants were negligent, grossly negligent, acted with malice, proximately caused appellees' damages, created a nuisance, and awarded actual damages for property damage and mental anguish, as well as punitive damages. Appellants sought review. In reversing the judgment against one appellant, the court found that its limited involvement in the facility's operations was insufficient to establish the type of control necessary for a finding of negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. As to the remaining appellants, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish that appellants acted with gross negligence, but not malice, in that they proceeded with conscious indifference to the rights, safety, and welfare of others. The court reversed the trial court's award of mental anguish because, where a claim of mental anguish was based solely upon property damage resulting from gross negligence, recovery was contingent upon evidence of some ill will, which appellees did not show. The modified judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, in part, and affirmed a modified judgment. Modified judgment was rendered in favor of one appellant pipeline company because of its limited involvement, and the court vacated only the award for past and future mental anguish and the finding of malice as to other appellant pipeline companies. The court remanded for recomputation of the punitive damage cap and prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for assaulting his wife one year after his indictment for aggravated assault from the same occurrence was dismissed. Thirty months after his arrest, defendant was convicted. However, the state was only responsible for 18 months' delay. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. Eighteen months delay was not presumptively prejudicial because the purpose of the two-year assault statute of limitations was the same as the speedy trial right. Defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of prejudice. In any case, defendant failed to timely assert his speedy trial right. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of his wife's substance abuse prior to determining its relevance because the trial court implicitly made findings of fact and conclusions of law when it ruled upon the admissibility of the evidence. Defendant did not always give the trial court reasons why witnesses' testimony should have been admissible, and failed to present the same arguments on appeal as he had at trial. The trial court could conclude that evidence that defendant's wife had fallen and hurt herself in the past was inadmissible character evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because he did not make a prima facie showing of prejudice, and he failed to timely assert his speedy trial right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband and appellee wife were divorced in 1980 and husband was ordered to pay child support until the children reached 18.

The trial court denied the motion to stay and ordered the arrearage to be withheld from appellant's wages. On appeal the court affirmed, because the only grounds to challenge the withholding were as a dispute over the identity of the obligor or the amount of the arrearage. The court found that there were no constitutional protections applicable to a wage withholding order and laches was not an available defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with indecent exposure, a misdemeanor. He signed a written jury waiver and announced his intent to plead either guilty or nolo contendere to the charge. State refused to consent to defendant's waiver and requested that a jury be impaneled. The trial court accepted the waiver and set the case for a plea hearing. State sought a writ of mandamus to compel the trial court to empanel a jury. The court rendered an opinion, but the parties sought rehearing thereof for clarification. The court granted the request for rehearing and issued a new opinion explaining its reversal of the trial court's decision. The court concluded concluding that defendant's jury waiver was invalid because state did not consent to the waiver and such consent was required under Tex. Crim. Proc. Ann. &sect; 1.13(a). The court further held that state's consent was required even though defendant planned to enter a guilty or nolo contendre plea because it was the jury's responsibility to assess punishment where such a plea was entered and the penalty to the offense was not fixed by law. Thus court thus concluded that state was entitled to a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the matter with directions for the lower court to set the cause for the jury docket.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant arrestee sought review of a decision of the District Court of Comal County, 274th Judicial District (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellees, city and police officer, in appellant's suit claiming damages for injuries suffered while he was incarcerated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant arrestee brought a suit against appellees, city and police officer, for injuries suffered when appellees took blood and hair samples pursuant to court order, while appellant was incarcerated following his arrest on charges of aggravated assault. Appellant first brought the claims in federal court. The federal district court dismissed appellant's federal claims with prejudice and his state-law claims without prejudice. Appellant sought review, and the court of appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the cause to the federal district court, which again dismissed the cause. Nearly six years after the incident, appellant brought suit in state court, alleging that the taking of the samples violated state law. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment without specifying a basis, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, holding that the acts complained of in appellant's complaint filed after the summary judgment motion were essentially unchanged from those alleged before, and that the federal-court dismissal, which was not based on lack of jurisdiction, did not toll the running of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment to appellees, city and police officer, in appellant arrestee's suit claiming damages for injuries suffered while he was incarcerated, because the grounds considered in the summary judgment motion encompassed those raised in appellant's later petition and dismissal of appellant's federal claim had not tolled the running of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant reporter aired a story suggesting that appellee, a city employee, withheld information during an investigation of a city department and that the department reassigned him as a result.

Appellants sought interlocutory review of the partial grant of its summary judgment motion. Over appellees objection, the court held that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 51.014(6), which provided for interlocutory appeals for media defendants in libel cases, was constitutional. The court declined jurisdiction over appellees request for review of the dismissal of their emotional distress claim, as it did not fall within &sect; 51.014(6). The court reversed the denial of appellants' summary judgment motion as to the libel and tortious interference claims because the claims fell within &sect; 51.014(6), appellant reporter's story was substantially true, and appellee manager did not suffer an adverse employment action sufficient to support a tortious interference claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his convictions in the 64th District Court of Hale County, Texas, for driving while intoxicated, each enhanced by a prior felony conviction. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in not affording him a competency hearing, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, that one of his cases was improperly transferred, and that his sentences were improperly enhanced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his convictions for driving while intoxicated, each enhanced by a prior felony conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct a competency hearing before accepting appellant's guilty pleas. The trial court had inquired into appellant's competency, and appellant's counsel stated that appellant was competent to stand trial, therefore, nothing was preserved for appellate review. The court also held that appellant's counsel's conduct did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, and appellant failed to establish that absent counsel's errors, he would not have pled guilty. Appellant contended that the indictment underlying his prior felony conviction was defective and therefore, his current convictions were improperly enhanced by the use thereof. The court held that because the indictment alleged with reasonable certainty the reckless act relied upon, it was not defective. Further, the court held that when the judge in one district court mistakenly believed that he was disqualified from hearing appellant's case, his transfer of the case was not improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for driving while intoxicated, each enhanced by a prior felony conviction. The court found that the trial judge did not improperly transfer the case, appellant's counsel was not ineffective, the trial court did not err in not affording appellant a competency hearing before accepting his guilty pleas, and the indictments underlying his prior felonies were not fundamentally defective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the revocation of his probation in the 185th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which was imposed upon his conviction of the charge of sexual assault of a child pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1987). Defendant was to serve his original 10 year prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the trial court's revocation of his probation imposed upon his conviction of sexual assault of an child, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021 (1987), and reimposition of his 10 year prison sentence. Defendant asserted that it was error to admit statements made during a polygraph test and to admit his statements in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 38.22 (1997). Defendant argued that it was an abuse of discretion to revoke his probation, and dismiss his motion to quash the state's motion to revoke his probation. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that defendant's statements made to a polygraph examiner were voluntary and not the results of a polygraph test, and that there was no violation of statute because while defendant had to undergo a polygraph exam as a condition of his probation, there was no custodial interrogation. The court found no abuse of discretion in the revocation of defendant's probation because proof of one violation was sufficient to revoke probation. The court held that it was not unreasonable to require defendant to stay away from persons below age 17, and complainants were known to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A revocation of defendant's probation and a reimposition of a 10 year prison sentence was affirmed because statements made to a polygraph examiner were voluntary, because although defendant was required to take a polygraph, it was not a custodial interrogation, and revocation was not an abuse of discretion where defendant violated a condition, and because the conditions of probation were not unreasonable and defendant knew the complainants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff challenged as inadequate the jury's award of damages for severe personal injuries plaintiff suffered in a bow accident. On appeal, the court held that during voir dire, a juror blatantly failed to reveal under questioning by plaintiff's counsel that she was biased against personal injury claimants. However, the juror's bias, which she freely expressed to other jurors during trial and jury deliberations, was not reversible error under Tex. R. Civ. P. 327 or Tex. R. Evid. 606(b) because the testimony and affidavits other jurors were not admissible to prove that the biased juror was incompetent to serve on the jury. However, the court held that the biased juror's misconduct prevented plaintiff from receiving a fair trial as guaranteed by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. Therefore, Tex. R. Civ. P. 327(b), which prevented impeachment of the jury verdict based on evidence emanating from jury deliberations rather than outside influence, was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the jury's damage award and remanded for a new personal injury trial. A state procedural rule that prevented plaintiff from using other jurors' testimony and affidavits to show that a biased juror had harmed plaintiff's chances for a more favorable damage award was unconstitutional because the rule abrogated the state constitution's guarantee of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sheriff's deputy sought review of the 225th Judicial District Court, Bexar County (Texas), which upheld appellant's suspension without pay imposed by appellee county sheriff's civil service commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court, which approved of the decision by appellee county sheriff's civil Service commission to suspend appellant sheriff's deputy following an incident in which an inmate escaped from appellant's custody. Appellant contended that Bexar County Sheriff's Department Civil Service Commission, Texas, R. 11.07, which was enacted pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't. Code Ann. &sect; 158.035(a)(5) (1998), was an unconstitutional violation of his property right under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because R. 11.07 placed on appellant, the burden of proving that an adverse action by the sheriff's department should not be upheld. The court disagreed with appellant and held that in light of Bexar County Sheriff's Department Civil Service Commission, Texas, R. 11.10, which required that the sheriff's department present its case first at a review hearing, that R. 11.07 did not place an unconstitutional burden of production on a disciplined employee. The court held that appellee's action could be supported because appellant failed to meet a burden of persuasion and not an unconstitutional burden of production.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the decision was based on the fact that appellant did not meet his burden of persuasion and not a burden of production that was of questionable constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, mother of decedent, on behalf of decedent's heirs sought review of an order by the 217th District Court, Angelina County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee dentist in a case arising out of appellee's purported negligent treatment of decedent prior to his death from cancer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee dentist treated decedent prior to his death. Appellant, mother of decedent, on behalf of decedent's heirs contended that appellee misdiagnosed lumps in decedent's mouth and a lesion on his lip by not determining that they were cancerous. Appellee filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to medical negligence based upon the two-year statute of limitations as provided in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1998). The limitations period began to run on the last day of appellee's treatment of the decedent and no claim was filed until well after the expiration of the limitations period. Decedent learned of the misdiagnosis six months before the end of the limitations period. The court further found upon the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution that decedent did not bring his claim within a reasonable time after discovery of facts sufficient to put him on notice of the claim. The court remanded appellant's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because there was a fact issue as to whether appellee added the entry of a missed appointment in order to demonstrate contributory negligence on the part of the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court held that decedent was barred by the two-year statute of limitations from bringing a cause of action for medical negligence, but that there was a fact issue pertaining to appellee's possible intentional infliction of emotional distress claim that required remand for trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, alleging the trial court erred by denying his motions to suppress a breath test and other sobriety tests because the stipulated evidence was too conclusory to establish probable cause for his arrest. The court affirmed, first holding that evidence that appellant disregarded a red light gave police sufficient authority to stop and investigate pursuant to Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 543.001, .004 (1998). Furthermore, appellant smelled strongly of alcohol, and his speech was slurred. Appellant had also argued that his stipulation was so detailed that no inferences or deductions could properly be drawn from it, under the &quot;agreed case&quot; doctrine utilized in civil cases. The court, however, rejected the agreed case analysis for a criminal case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee lion owners moved to a new city, and one month later appellant municipality passed an ordinance which prohibited the keeping of pet lions. Appellees sought a permanent injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance against them. Appellees claimed the ordinance constituted an ex post facto law as applied to them and that appellant lacked authority to pass the ordinance, which deemed pet lions a nuisance per se. The trial court found for appellees and granted injunctive relief. The court also awarded appellees attorney's fees. Appellant challenged the trial court ruling, and the court reversed. The court held that the ordinance at issue, which did not punish or increase the punishment for acts previously committed, but only attempted to prevent future actions, was not an ex post facto law. The court held that appellant was justified when it declared pet lions a nuisance per se, and therefore had the authority to do so, where the evidence showed that lions posed a threat to humans. Because the trial court lacked a basis upon which to grant injunctive relief, the court reversed the trial court ruling and ordered that appellees take nothing.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws 583, 609-11, amended by Tex. Gov't Code Ann.  &sect;&sect; 554.001- 554.009, and awarded future lost earnings, mental anguish, and punitive damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee employee was a peace officer who took a promotional position in policing illegal environmental dumping. In response to investigating and reporting an illegal disposal site owned by a former city official, appellee's reputable career deteriorated, he received his first disciplinary action in fourteen years of work, and was demoted. Appellee filed suit against appellant city employer for retaliatory discrimination under the Whistleblower Act, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 583, 609-11 (amended by Tex.

The court affirmed the judgment reviewing 11 points of error, holding the pleadings and evidence were factually and legally sufficient. An inference of reasonable cause supported discrimination when appellee's protected report was filed on illegal dumping in good faith. Exemplary or punitive damages, mental anguish damages, and future lost earning damages, were proper where sufficient evidence supported the awards, proper calculation was made, and the amounts were not excessive. A motion for change of venue was properly denied weighing the interests of the parties for a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was arrested and convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), but contended several points of error in the trial court's admission of evidence. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because the officer's decision to pull his car over was unconstitutional. The court held that the officer had a reasonable suspicion to justify a Terry stop from the totality of the circumstances. There was reasonable suspicion because appellant's vehicle was weaving back and forth in its lane. Appellant also contended that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his objections to admission of an &quot;intoxication video,&quot; which filmed appellant taking field sobriety tests at the police station following his arrest. The court held that a trial court had broad discretion to admit the videotape over an objection to the video's quality and that videos were admissible under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 901, 1001(2). An observing officer properly authenticated the video. Additionally, the audio portion of the videotape was admissible because appellant had been properly advised of his Miranda rights before the custodial interrogation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted for indecency with a child. After finding appellant guilty, the trial court sentenced appellant to prison. The appeals court reversed, holding that the denial of appellant's right to a jury trial was a constitutional structural error and not subject to a harm analysis. Thus, the error was harmful. The right to a jury trial at the guilt stage was both a statutory right and a constitutional right, pursuant to U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 &amp; amend. VI; Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15; and Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 1.12 (1977). The right could not be relinquished, except by an express waiver. As appellant did not waive his right to a jury trial, the conviction and sentence were reversed and the action was remanded. The court affirmed that part of the judgment which found that the facts asserted in the indictment were a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.11(a)(1) (1994). The testimony established that appellant committed the charged offense prior to and within 10 years of the presentment of the indictment and was sufficient to support appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Candidate's license to practice law was placed in inactive status. Candidate applied to return to active status on June 14, 1989 and resumed the practice of law in September 1994. She was reinstated to practice law on November 18, 1994. On March 10, 1998, candidate won a nomination to run for a judicial position. Relator candidate filed a request for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent political party chairman to remove candidate's name from the ballot because she did not practice law for four years before the election, as required by Tex. Gov't Code Ann. 25.0014(3) (1998). The court had jurisdiction under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 273.061 (1986). Relator had standing because he was a candidate for the same election and he had an interest in not being opposed by an ineligible candidate. The court held that candidate returned to active status when her application and fees were received, which was a question of fact. The court could not grant mandamus relief because such relief was only available when the law clearly spelled out a duty to perform, and there was no clear duty because it was not established when candidate returned to active status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff patient appealed a decision of the 192nd Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas) granting summary judgment in favor of defendant health care providers in plaintiff's suit alleging fraud, false imprisonment, battery, negligence, gross negligence, negligence per se, deceptive trade practices, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent misrepresentation, and conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a minor, plaintiff was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment under the care of defendant health care providers. Following her release she brought a malpractice suit alleging numerous claims related thereto. Defendants filed motions for summary judgment on the basis of limitations, which the trial court granted. After plaintiff nonsuited her fraud claim, the trial court entered final judgment ordering plaintiff take nothing against defendants. Plaintiff appealed and the court affirmed. The court concluded that she was required to bring suit on or before her twentieth birthday and thus, unless an exception to the statute of limitations applied, her claims were barred by limitations. The court found that because her injuries were not inherently undiscoverable, the discovery rule did not apply to her claims as a matter of law. The court also found that she could not rely on the doctrine of fraudulent concealment to defeat defendants' limitations claim. Finally, the court concluded that the evidence relied on by plaintiff was not sufficient to raise a fact issue as to whether the unsound mind doctrine applied to toll limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in defendant health care providers' favor because under the applicable statute of limitations, absent an exception, plaintiff patient was required to bring suit on or before her twentieth birthday. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the discovery rule, the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, and the unsound mind doctrine defeated defendants' limitations claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pleaded guilty to the delivery of a controlled substance, and the trial court assessed punishment of confinement. Appellant also pleaded no contest to aggravated robbery and the trial court assessed punishment of confinement. The two sentences were to run concurrently. The court affirmed. Appellant contended that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 1.15 (1998) was unconstitutional, because it denied appellant the right to compulsory process. The court considered and rejected the contention in a previous case. Appellant also contended that the trial court committed fundamental error by accepting his plea when the record was silent about whether he waived his right to compulsory process. However, there was no requirement that appellant specifically waive his right, so the court overruled that point of error. Appellant additionally contended that the sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Appellant had not objected at the sentencing hearing nor had he filed a motion for new trial. Therefore, appellant waived these points of error. The court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On a motion for rehearing, defendant appealed his conviction from the County Criminal Court at Law No. 15, Harris County (Texas) for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped twice for routine traffic violations. Each time he was arrested for DWI and he refused to perform a breath test. At trial, he filed pretrial motions to suppress his refusals to take breath tests and all evidence arising out of his initial stops, and to declare Tex. Transp. Code &sect; 724.061&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motions, except it suppressed the audio portion of the video of his first arrest. Defendant then pled no contest to both charges of misdemeanor DWI. Defendant appealed, asserting error as to the trial court's denial of his pretrial motions. The court affirmed. The court found that defendant was not allowed to stipulate to evidence, and then attack it for the first time on appeal on the grounds that the stipulation was too conclusory and did not set out the underlying basis for the arresting officer's conclusions. The court found the warnings defendant received substantially complied with the language and purpose of the statute. Finally, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled defendant's motion for rehearing, withdrew its earlier opinion, and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that defendant's contentions as to the suppression of the breath tests and evidence obtained during the initial traffic stop lacked merit as did his argument regarding the constitutionality of the transportation statute making certain testimony concerning breathalyzer tests admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient sought review of a judgment of the 295th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which ruled in favor of appellee doctors and granted appellee hospital a directed verdict. Appellant alleged negligence and lack of actual consent as to appellee doctors and negligent credentialing as to appellee hospital with respect to two of four surgeries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient fell in a bathtub, injured his back, underwent surgery, and subsequently re-injured his back in three other incidents. Appellant underwent four surgeries. At trial, a doctor testified that appellant's condition had improved as a result of the four surgeries. Appellant sued as to the last two surgeries. The trial court bifurcated the negligence claims against appellee doctors from the negligent credentialing claims against appellee hospital. The jury found for appellee doctors and the trial court granted appellee hospital a directed verdict. The court held that a physician's failure to disclose was not a cause of a patient's injury if the patient was not injured by the risk of which he was not informed. The court held that the trial court properly severed the actions because trying both claims simultaneously would have prejudiced appellee doctors. Character evidence admissible in appellee hospital's defense was inadmissible as to appellee doctors. The trial court properly overruled appellant's objection to a new and independent cause jury instruction because there was evidence in the record that the additional surgeries were not caused by appellee doctor's actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee doctors and the directed verdict in favor of appellee hospital. The court held that even if appellant had rebutted the statutory presumption of disclosure, appellant had not experienced any injury from the risks that he contended should have been disclosed. A directed verdict as to appellee hospital was appropriate because appellee hospital's liability was derivative of appellee doctors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant grocery company filed a tax refund claim with appellee comptroller for sales taxes paid to the power company. Appellant had a two-party contract with the power company. Appellee based the claim on two new exemptions enacted in 1987 and 1990. A previous exemption under 1961 Tex. Gen. Laws 71, 84 contained language almost identical to the new exemptions. The 1961 exemption was judicially interpreted as applying only to prior three-party contracts. Appellee initially followed the judicial interpretation. Appellee later permitted two-party contract exemptions, and appellant filed the claim. Appellee then readopted the judicial interpretation, and the claim was denied. Appellant exhausted the administrative remedies. The trial court ruled for appellee. Appellant sought review, but the court affirmed the trial court. Appellee did not contravene its prior rule, rather it changed the prior unwritten policy. There was no unconstitutional retroactive application because the interpretation had not created a vested right. The legislative acceptance doctrine did not apply. All taxpayers were treated equally and the classification was rational under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(a).</SPAN></P>

They also sought damages resulting from work that appellant already had done at the well site. The trial court found that appellant had violated Waskom, Tex., Ordinance No. 96, &sect; A-2(a), as amended, awarded appellees damages plus attorney fees, granted appellees' request for a permanent injunction, denied appellant's requested declaratory and injunctive relief, and held that oil well operations within 500 feet of buildings and residences endangered the public. Appellant challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. By enacting the amended ordinance, the city, pursuant to its police power, created a valid restriction on appellant's rights under the original gas lease, which allowed drilling operations within 200 feet of existing buildings. The denial of appellant's request for a drilling permit did not involve a retroactive application of the amended ordinance, which was valid. Appellees' pleading sufficiently stated claims for trespass and conversion. Appellees' failure to segregate the fees did not prevent them from recovering the entire amount.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that an order for spousal maintenance was similar to an award of child support and would only be reversed upon a showing of abuse of discretion. The court further stated that the minimum reasonable needs was not defined in the federal minimum wage statute and thus was a fact specific determination that should be made by the trial court.

After the stop, the officer gave field sobriety tests and then waited for another patrol car with a video camera, and administered further tests. The videotapes were admitted at trial, despite motions to suppress. Following his conviction for driving while intoxicated appellant sought review. On appeal the court affirmed, holding first that the officer required reasonable suspicion, rather than probable cause, to stop appellant and the officer's experience and observation satisfied this requirement, and no violation of statute was needed. The court also held that warnings under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. &sect; 38.22 applied only to custodial arrests, and the video was taken before arrest. Finally, the court held that the trial court's failure to allow defense counsel more time to read a police report did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict as appellant's attorney had ample time to read the report at subsequent recesses and examine the officer who wrote it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant defendant's conviction of driving while intoxicated because an officer had the necessary reasonable suspicion to stop appellant based on experience and a mile of observed weaving, video was properly taken before custodial rights adhered, and appellant's counsel had ample time to read a police report and examine the author after allowing counsel only five minutes to initially read it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of an order revoking his probation for the sexual assault of a child. Appellant contended that the enactment of a new law provided him with an affirmative defense to the underlying charge. The court stated that the record contained no facts to support the applicability of the new law to appellant's case. The court found that the revocation was properly based on evidence that appellant had violated several conditions of his probation including the failure to pay required fees and his failure to participate in a mandatory sex offender treatment program. However, the court also found that the community service obligation that had been imposed on appellant was unenforceable because it failed to specify when or how he was to complete his community service hours. The court ruled that the unenforceability of the community service condition did not prevent the revocation of appellant's probation because proof of appellant's violation of any one of the valid probation conditions was sufficient to support an order of revocation. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's order revoking appellant's probation.</SPAN></P>

Since this was not the case here, the court held that there was nothing for it to review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered the appeal dismissed because, since there was no order revoking defendant's probation, there was nothing for the court to review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the judgment from the 158th District Court of Denton County (Texas), which convicted and sentenced appellant of the felony offense of engaging in organized criminal activity predicated on theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, appellant convict entered a plea of guilty to the felony offense of engaging in organized criminal activity pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02, the predicate offense was theft. Appellant challenged the judgment contending that the Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02 was facially unconstitutional as it authorized multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, the double jeopardy clause. Although appellant had not raised the double jeopardy issue in the trial court, the court heard the appeal as it found that it would have been an injustice to apply the new appellate rules and as appellant was contending that the statute was facially unconstitutional. The court determined that the statute had not violated the double jeopardy clause as the legislature intended that each violation was a separate offense. Thus, appellant could be charged for both the theft offense and the offense of engaging in organized criminal activity, predicated on theft. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a non jury trial, the trial court determined that appellant attorney had violated the Tex. Disciplinary R.

The court found that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support fining that appellant had violated both rules. Appellant had deposited settlement funds into a joint account which he used for personal expenses without consent of the client and as the deposited funds were to be used for other litigation, instead of the payment of medical fees which he had promised the client's medical providers. Rules were not unconstitutionally vague, as a lawyer of common intelligence would have realized that the use of the misleading letters of protection and use of settlement funds for personal expenses demonstrated a lack of probity, integrity, and straight forwardness. As the reference to the repealed rule was a clerical error in the judgment, the court exercised its authority to correct the error. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a decision from the County Criminal Court No. 10, Dallas County (Texas), which convicted him of harassment in a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of harassment in a jury trial. Appellant raised six points of error, including misstatements in the prosecutor's opening statement, false testimony by the complainant, an admission by the complainant, and that Tex.

Further, appellant requested an appointment of an attorney on appeal, contending he was indigent. The trial court found that appellant was not indigent and the court denied appellant's request for appointed counsel. Further, due to appellant failing to file the reporter's records, the court overruled five points of error because it could not determine the merits of appellant's complaints about the opening statements and testimony at trial. As to appellant's final point of error regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 42.07(a)(4), the court found that such section was constitutional and therefore affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the 144th Judicial District Court, Bexar County (Texas), that enhanced his punishment for the crime of serious bodily injury to a child based on reckless conduct. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to enhance his punishment under the Texas Hate Crimes Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.014 (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the third-degree felony offense of serious bodily injury to a child based on reckless conduct, and his punishment range was enhanced to that of a second-degree felony based on the Texas Hate Crimes Act (Act), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.014 (1993), and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.47 (1994). On defendant's appeal of his sentence enhancement, the court affirmed, holding that defendant was properly sentenced under the Act and &sect; 12.47. The court found that the evidence established that defendant consistently abused the victim because of the dark color of his skin and used racial slurs in referring to him. Even though the victim was not African-American, the court ruled that the Act applied because defendant's actions were based on his perception of the victim's race. The court concluded that enhancement under the Act could be based upon circumstantial evidence, and that a bias motivation for the crime charged could reasonably be inferred from defendant's pattern of abuse based on prejudice. The court also ruled that the jury's finding of reckless conduct did not preclude a finding by the trial judge that defendant intentionally selected his victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's sentence enhancement because the evidence that defendant had a pattern of abusing the victim based on the victim's perceived race was legally and factually sufficient to support the enhancement under the Texas Hate Crimes Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted by a jury of aggravated assault with a firearm, and his punishment was assessed at 15 years of imprisonment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city employees sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Travis County (Texas) that granted appellee city's motion for summary judgment in appellants' action to have amendment to city charter declared unconstitutional. Appellants asserted that amendment, which eliminated health benefits for domestic partners, violated equal protection rights, impaired existing contract rights, and was prohibited by promissory estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee city in appellants' action that asserted that amendment to city charter, which effectively discontinued extension of health benefits to domestic partners of city employees, was unconstitutional. The court held that the amendment did not violate the equal protection clause. The court found that the amendment was aimed at unmarried domestic partners, not homosexuals. Under the rational relation test, the court found that the amendment was rationally related to the aims of fiscal responsibility and favoring the legally cognizable relationship of marriage. The court held that the amendment did not retroactively impair appellee's existing contractual obligations. The court found that the employee handbook, which expressly granted right to amend benefits, did not created a protected interest for appellants in those benefits. However, the court held that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellants acted in detrimental reliance on benefits granted and then taken away.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; safety Code &sect; 361.221(a)(1) and 361.221(a)(2), in the District Court of Travis County, 331st Judicial District (Texas).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the denial of his two writs of habeas corpus based on the alleged unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect;361.221(a)(1) and 361.221(a)(2). The court rejected appellant's argument and affirmed the denial of relief from the conviction for transpiration of hazardous waste. The court explained the state statute's incorporation by reference of the federal definition of hazardous waste was constitutional and not an impermissible delegation of authority. The court further explained the state legislature adopted the federal administrative definition of waste that was in existence at the time the statute was enacted and did not attempt to adopt future federal administrative definitions. As a result, the court reasoned the state statute did not need to include procedural standards to limit the agency's future rulemaking power. The court determined the agency's rulemaking power was limited to those past rulemaking acts that had been approved by the state legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed denial of appellant petitioner's request for writs of habeas corpus under Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act because the statute was constitutional and not an impermissible delegation of authority to define a crime when the statute incorporated by reference a then existing definition of hazardous waste contained in a federal statute, but did not attempt to incorporate future definitions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered an order dismissing appellant's suit against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and imposed costs against him. He challenged the dismissal, raising several arguments in his appeal. The court overruled appellant's contention that the trial court's order was erroneous and unenforceable, as it failed to specify the exact amount of costs charged against him. Instead, the court found that the order imposed costs in the precise language of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 14.006 (Supp. 1998); although the total amount of costs was not specified, the order did give specific directions for the calculation of those costs and the method of paying them. Moreover, it was sufficient to give notice of the amount and the method of payment of such costs. The court also disagreed with appellant that the trial court should have taxed the costs as permitted by Tex. R. Civ. P. 141, as there was no proof that appellant was unable to pay the costs. The court also found that &sect; 14.006 provided for a notice and hearing, as written and applied, and that it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; the statute was thus constitutional. The order below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He was arrested and convicted of possession of more than 400 grams of cocaine and of engaging in organized criminal activity in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02(a)(5) (1998). On appeal, the reviewing court found that evidence was legally and factually sufficient to convict defendant of possession of cocaine as either a principal or party. When viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, evidence was sufficient to prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence was not so uncertain, inconsistent, improbable, or unbelievable that it would be clearly unjust to allow the verdicts to stand. Although distribution of a controlled substance was not an enumerated offense in the penal code, distribution was defined as a means of delivery and delivery was an offense. Thus, distribution of cocaine was an offense and the statute under which defendant was convicted was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's objection to admissibility of evidence dealt with an improper predicate and not the admission itself, so the issue of admissibility was not preserved for appeal. Judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellants alleged that their mother established limitation title to all, or in the alternative, an undivided one-half interest in the tract at issue and that upon her intestate death that they had succeeded to her interest. Appellees contended that appellants' claims to title based upon adverse possession were barred because the alleged 10 year adverse possession period was interrupted by prior court order. The reviewing court found that there was a fact question as to whether a particular individual abandoned his prior action for specific performance of a written contract to sell the subject property.

Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 724.011 and Tex. Transp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant driver was stopped for speeding, submitted to a breath test, and was subsequently arrested for driving while intoxicated. Appellant refused to take a second breath test and his license was suspended for ninety days. Appellant claimed that Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 724.011 and Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect; 724.012 were unconstitutional because the language permitting &quot;one or more&quot; specimens was vague and allowed arbitrary and capricious enforcement. The court noted that because it was a civil statute it was subject to a less strict vagueness test and found that it was not vague and that appellant had fair warning that refusal to submit to the tests would result in suspension. Because appellant was not under arrest during the first test, he was only asked to submit to one test under the statute. Because there was no evidence of actual abuse by officers when requesting tests, the court refused to hold the statute facially invalid merely because it could be unconstitutionally applied under hypothetical facts. Because appellant failed to show the statute was unconstitutionally vague or enforced arbitrarily or in a discriminatory manner as applied to him, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant female students brought suit against appellee school district and district employees for failing to stop sexual harassment by fellow students. Appellees moved for summary judgment, arguing sovereign and statutory immunity, collateral estoppel, failure to state a claim, lack of standing, mootness, and vagueness. The trial court granted appellees' motion, and appellants challenged the adverse decision. While the order granting summary judgment failed to set forth the grounds upon which summary judgment was granted, summary judgment was to be affirmed if any asserted ground was valid. Summary judgment in favor of appellees was affirmed, as appellants' claim was void under the mootness doctrine where the wrongful behavior had ceased and there was no showing that it was expected to recur. Appellants failed to establish the capable of repetition exception to the mootness doctrine where there was no reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same complaining parties would recur if not address and failed to establish a collateral consequences exception where there was no showing that the effects of the events continued to stigmatize them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled nolo contendere to the offenses of resisting arrest and driving with a suspended license. Appellant was arrested after a computer check showed appellant's driver's license was suspended. Appellant challenged the trial court's decisions denying his motion to suppress evidence and his motion to dismiss the driving with a suspended license case. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court held that appellant had waived his complaints concerning the admissibility of the police report because appellant did not object to the police report in the trial court on the grounds raised on appeal, but instead offered the report into evidence. The court found that there was probable cause for appellant's warrantless arrest because the police officers were entitled to rely on the computer check that showed appellant's driver's license was suspended. The court held that the requirement that a person possess a driver's license does not abrogate a person's right to travel and that the suspension of a driver's license for violation of a state traffic law did not unconstitutionally burden the right to travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to burglary. Although he pleaded not true to a paragraph alleging a 1990 murder conviction, the trial court found the allegation true. At the punishment hearing, defendant requested sentencing under Tex.

The trial court assessed punishment as a third-degree felony and sentenced appellant to seven years' confinement and an $ 800 fine. On defendant's claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, by which he sought to exclude from evidence items found in his truck, the court held that his nonnegotiated guilty plea was conclusive as to his guilt and waived all nonjurisdictional defects occurring prior to the guilty plea. The court further held that defendant's prior conviction which occurred prior to the enactment of a statute providing for increased punishment upon his subsequent conviction could be used for enhancement purposes under that statute, and that such usage was not unconstitutional as being ex post facto application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee landowners filed a declaratory action against appellant city to prevent appellant from carrying out a proposed annexation of appellees' property. Appellant sought interlocutory review of the decision of the trial court that denied appellant's plea to the jurisdiction.

The court found that because appellees' petition was at most merely insufficient to demonstrate jurisdiction, without affirmatively showing a lack thereof, the trial court was required to give appellees an opportunity to amend before dismissing. Although the pleading of a mere threat to annex appellees' property was not enough to demonstrate a ripe controversy, the court found that appellees' second amended complaint alleged an actual annexation of property by the city and thereby demonstrated a ripe controversy. The court dismissed appellant's appeal as moot because the relief it would have granted, namely leave to amend the complaint, was accomplished.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the writ and conducted an evidentiary hearing. At the hearing, evidence was admitted that established appellant expected money from an inheritance, appellant would flee, and that no bail bondsman would write a $ 500,000 bond. The trial court refused to lower the bond. The court found that it was appellant's burden to show that the bail was excessive. Appellant failed to show that the application of Tex. Code. Crim. P.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his conviction, which was entered in the County Court at Law No. 1 of El Paso County (Texas), for illegal dumping. Subsequent to the appeal, he moved for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant and his son used a pick-up truck to take dirt from a home under construction to another construction site and dumped it near dirt from that site. Appellant was convicted of illegal dumping and sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended, and a fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, appellant admitted his guilt. In an opinion substituted for a previous one in the same case, the court held that, because appellant testified at the punishment stage of the trial and admitted his guilt of the crime, for legal purposes, he entered the equivalent of a plea of guilty. The court held that appellant waived any evidentiary complaints by so testifying. The court examined appellant's federal constitutional argument on the merits and found that a person of ordinary intelligence would not mistake the specific statutory exception in Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 365.012(a), (f)(2) (1998), for dirt and rock &quot;used to fill land&quot; as an open invitation to dump dirt and rock at any convenient construction site. Therefore, the court overruled appellant's motion for rehearing and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 208th District Court, Harris County (Texas), for engaging in organized criminal activity, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02(a) (1998). Appellant asserted error in the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment and his motion to instruct the state to disclose the identity of a confidential informant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity. The court affirmed. First, the court rejected appellant's assertion that the organized crime statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02(a) (1998), was improperly and unconstitutionally applied to his case because his activities were not meant to be covered by the statute. The court held that there was no basis to sustain this point of error because appellant cited, and the court found, no authority providing that a statute was unconstitutionally vague merely for extending beyond its intended scope. Next, the court rejected appellant's request to reveal the identity of a confidential informant referred to in the affidavit that supported the search and arrest warrant. The court held that appellant did not demonstrate that the informant's testimony was so necessary to a fair determination of guilt that the trial court's denial of his motion to disclose the informant's identity was outside the zone of reasonable disagreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed and held that appellant failed to provide the court with any authority which supported his contention that the statute he violated was unconstitutionally vague simply for extending beyond the scope the legislature intended. The court also held that appellant failed to show that testimony of an informant was necessary for a fair determination of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the order of the County Court of Law No. 1, Fort Bend County, Texas, which denied his pretrial motions to have Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted for misdemeanor driving while intoxicated, he received permission from the trial court to appeal the denial of his pretrial motions. The court disagreed with defendant that the stipulated evidence was too conclusory to establish probable cause to stop him in the first place. Defendant had stipulated that based on his glassy, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, smell of alcoholic beverage on his body and breath, and his failure of three field sobriety tests, the officer arrested him for DWI. At the hearing on his pretrial motions, defendant failed to explain why he thought the officer lacked probable cause to stop him, argue the substance of his appellate attack on such probable cause, or claim that stipulated evidence was insufficient to support a conviction to the trial court. Thus, any error arising out of the conclusory stipulated facts was waived. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress evidence of a breath test refusal or that the statute permitting the introduction of such refusal was unconstitutional, because defendant did not refuse to take the breath test.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was involved in some sort of dispute with the justice of the peace. Appellant maintained that the witness tampering statute was unconstitutional and that she did not coerce the witness to withdraw her statement. Appellant had threatened to sue the witness civilly. The appellate court found appellant's actions satisfied the elements of the statute, which held that appellant was guilty of witness tampering if she attempted to coerce a prospective witness to withhold testimony.

Appellee committee filed suit to enjoin appellant from practicing law without a license. A temporary injunction was issued, and following trial, a permanent injunction was ordered. After appellant violated the injunction, appellant was found in contempt. Appellant sought review of the injunction and contempt order. The court affirmed. Appellant alleged that the order was entered in error because the trial court refused to hold a hearing to determine his ability to afford an attorney and also refused to appoint an attorney to represent him during the contempt hearing. The validity of a contempt judgment could be attacked only collaterally and by writ of habeas corpus. The rule extended to decisions regarding appointment of an attorney during the contempt hearing as well. The injunction was properly drafted because it spelled out the details of compliance in clear, specific, and unambiguous terms so that appellant readily knew exactly what he was prohibited from doing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant applicant previously held a bail bond license, which had been renewed twice. Subsequently, renewal was refused because appellee county bail bonds board determined that appellant had an unpaid final judgment on a bond forfeiture more than 30 days old, a statutory ground for rejection of renewal. Unable to renew her license, appellant submitted an application for a new license, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's summary judgment in favor of appellee. The court found that there were sufficient grounds to deny appellant's application and that the district court properly construed Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3, &sect;&sect; 3 and 6 (1998) in reviewing appellant's application for a new license. The court held that in permitting appellee to consider an applicant's prior performance, it was simply insuring that those who received a bail bond license were qualified and capable of performing within the statutory guidelines. The court held that where an applicant had previously held a license, appellee could investigate the applicant's past history as a licensee in determining whether the applicant was entitled to a new license.</SPAN></P>

He challenged his conviction, alleging that the oppression statute was unconstitutional both because it was vague, in violation of his federal due process rights, and because it was overbroad, offending his right to free speech. The court agreed, reversing his conviction and acquitting him of the crime. The court found that the conduct requirement of the statute, which prohibited intentionally subjecting another to sexual harassment, was vague, and that a reasonable person standard could not be read into the law. Furthermore, the statute could not be narrowly construed to eliminate the definition of sexual harassment because doing so would significantly alter the meaning of the statute. As an alternative basis for its holding, the court found that the statute was overbroad and violated U.S. Const. amend. I, because it was not narrowly tailored to prohibit only disorderly conduct, fighting words, obscene or opprobrious language, or unprotected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed appellant's conviction of official oppression and acquitted him of the crime, holding that the statute proscribing such conduct was vague on its face and as applied to him, in violation of federal due process protections. As an alternative basis for its holding, the court found the statute unconstitutionally overbroad, infringing on appellant's right to free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found engaged in delinquent conduct by committing the offense of possession of less than one gram of cocaine and placed on probation. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, asserting that it was the product of an unconstitutional search. The state contended the evidence was seized as the product of a valid investigative detention and search for weapons. The court reversed the judgment, finding that defendant was searched twice and that the second search was characterized as a protective weapons search. The court held that the purpose of a weapons search was not to discover evidence of a crime, but to allow an officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence. The court found that the second search was not justified as a protective weapons search after the first patdown revealed that defendant was not carrying a weapon. The court held that if a protective search went beyond what was necessary to determine if defendant was armed, it was no longer valid and it fruits would be suppressed. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, Comptroller of Public Accounts and Attorney General of the State of Texas, were granted summary judgment because the statute of limitations had run in the action brought by appellant corporation for a refund of franchise taxes. In 1989, appellees refunded a portion of the tax and appellant took no further action until 1993. The court rejected appellant's contention that the statute of limitations did not bar the refund request, holding that the refund claim expired on one of two dates: four years from the date the tax was due and payable; or four years, plus any applicable tolling period, from the date the tax was actually paid. The court held that the only way appellant could overcome the limitations argument was to establish that the period was tolled for over three, and appellant failed to do this. Appellant next contended that the appellees violated appellant's right to fair and equal taxation under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, by refusing to settle the refund claim. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the judgment, holding that it was within the discretion of appellee Attorney General to decide whether to settle the dispute or whether to go to trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants city and city manager challenged an order of the 134th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee news agency in appellee's suit seeking disclosure of information under the Texas Open Records Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 552.001-.353, arguing that the requested information was excepted from disclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee news agency submitted a request under the Texas Open Records Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 552.001-.353, for written information concerning the termination of appellant city's finance director. Appellant city manager declined the request, contending that any documents were excepted from disclosure. Appellee brought suit against appellants city and city manager seeking disclosure of the requested information. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and appellants challenged the order granting summary judgment in appellee's favor and denying their motion for summary judgment. In affirming summary judgment in favor of appellee, the appellate court concluded that the information was not excepted from disclosure under &sect; 552.111, the agency memorandum exception, where it was not a deliberate communication related to the policy-making process of appellant city. Policy-making functions did not encompass internal administrative or personnel matters. Thus, a memorandum concerning problems related to a particular employee did not involve appellant city's policy-making function, and no agency memorandum exception applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Summary judgment in favor of appellee news agency was affirmed, as information concerning a city employee's termination was public information subject to disclosure upon request. While agency memoranda, deliberate communications related to policy-making processes, were excepted from disclosure, a memorandum concerning one employee did not concern policy-making functions but concerned a personnel matter and was thus subject to disclosure.</SPAN></P>

Such factors as defendant's intent to kill witnesses weighed so strongly against the possibility that the jury might have been concerned with the application of good time, and disobeyed the court's directions not to consider it, that the court determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged error, if any, made no contribution to the punishment, and even if it was error, it was harmless.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the 184th Judicial District Court, Harris County (Texas), which denied his motion for a new trial in his conviction for aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted for aggravated robbery and his motion for a new trial was denied. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to the first prong of the Strickland test, defendant's attorney did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness when he assessed that appellant's confession was admissible and recommended that appellant should plead guilty. Appellant's confession was found to be admissible because although his arrest was without a warrant, it was justified under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 14.04 (1977). Next, the court held that since appellant failed to establish that any factually inaccurate information in the pre-sentence investigation (PSI) was materially inaccurate, there was no denial of due process and appellant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the PSI. Last, the court held that there was no constitutional requirement that a comparative proportionality review be conducted of appellant's sentence to that of his co-defendant, and because his sentence fell within the statutory limits for aggravated robbery, it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery was affirmed because his ineffective assistance of counsel claims were without merit, he was not denied due process of law, and his sixty-year sentence was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to the sentences of his co-defendants.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant had no constitutionally protected interest in being tried in a particular county, and that even though the trial court clearly violated Tex. Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, wife and husband, filed suit, after the statute of limitations had run, against appellees, doctor and cancer center, alleging that appellees negligently misinterpreted the results of appellant wife's mammogram, thereby allowing her cancer to go undetected for 16 months.

The court affirmed because statute of limitations had run, and the application of the statute of limitations did not violate the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of the Texas Constitution, which provides that all courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him, in his lands, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found the evidence used against appellant to be admissible. Two private citizens, the manager of the rental storage company and a renter who had claimed some items had been taken from her storage unit, discovered that appellant had several items in his storage unit that did not belong to him. After appellant had left to get a lock for his unit, the manager and renter entered appellant's unit and discovered the items and called the police. The court found that the search of appellant's storage unit did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV or Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9 since these provisions do not apply to actions by private citizens. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23(a) (1998), the court found that the private citizens did not violate the criminal trespass statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.05(a) (1994), when entering the storage space since the manager had a right to inspect open units under the lease agreement and did not violate the statute in obtaining the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the 194th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which convicted him for possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in an amount of one gram or more but less than four grams, enhanced by two prior felony convictions, contending that there was insufficient evidence and that it was error to overrule his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in an amount of one gram or more but less than four grams, enhanced by two prior felony convictions. On appeal, the court held that new legislation required the state to simply prove that adulterants or dilutants increased the bulk or quantity of the controlled substance, without having to prove intent to increase the bulk or quantity or that they did not affect the chemical activity of the controlled substance. Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.002(49) (1998). Therefore, the court found that the .85 grams pure cocaine and .17 grams of other material was sufficient to constitute &quot;at least one gram.&quot; The court also held that there was both legal and factual sufficiency to prove possession of the cocaine and that defendant lacked standing to contest the search and seizure of the automobile where the cocaine was found, because he was a mere passenger without a possessory interest in the car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, former municipal court judges, sued appellee for failure to reappoint them as municipal court judges, alleging discrimination under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA), Tex.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee on all causes of action. The principal issue presented on appeal was whether appellants, as municipal court judges, were employees under the TCHRA. Also at issue was whether appellee violated TOMA by allegedly making a final decision regarding appellants' employment in a closed session and whether appellants were terminated early. The court affirmed the summary judgment. Appellants were public officials rather than appellee's employees, precluding protection under the TCHRA. Appellants failed to preserve or present evidence showing appellee's violation of TOMA. Appellee did not terminate appellants' appointments early; by law appellants had a tenure of less than two years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction under the version of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.07 that was in effect at the time of his offense. On appeal, the court stated that between the time of the offense and the time of defendant's trial, the legislature amended art. 38.07. The amendments eliminated the necessity of corroboration and a timely outcry in cases where the complainant was under the age of 18. The court further stated that because art. 38.07 was a procedural statute, the amendments to the statute applied to defendant's case in the absence of an express legislative enactment giving them prospective application only. The record reflected that the complainant was 15 years old at the time of the offense. Thus, under the version of art. 38.07 in effect at the time of trial, the complainant's uncorroborated testimony was sufficient to convict defendant. Because complainant's uncorroborated testimony provided factually and legally sufficient evidence to support the conviction, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his conviction for murder, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful search, denying his motion to declare Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02&nbsp;unconstitutional, and admitting improper extraneous offense evidence. The court found that appellant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the search because he had moved out of the house and, therefore, had no expectation of privacy therein. Appellant argued that the amended &sect; 19.02 was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of showing sudden passion to the accused. The court disagreed finding the section to be constitutional. The court concluded that the testimony that appellant had assaulted the victim the day before the murder was admissible because it was probative of the previous relationship between appellant and the victim and his state of mind at the time of the offense; therefore, it was relevant for purposes other than showing appellant's character. The court concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prosecution appealed an order by the County Court at Law No. 2, Collin County (Texas), which dismissed with prejudice prosecution's information charging defendant with telephone harassment based on its grant of her special plea that the statute under which she was charged was unconstitutional under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01(a)(1)(1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with telephone harassment and she brought a motion to dismiss claiming that the statute under which she had been charged was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and dismissed the charges with prejudice. The prosecution recharged, but defendant claimed that double jeopardy and collateral estoppel barred the prosecution from recharging her. The court disagreed and held that the whole idea behind pre-trial motions under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 27.05(1989), was that all issues be determined before trial so that no double jeopardy problems arose. The court held that the pre-trial hearing, special plea, at which the trial court dismissed the first case was not a bar to recharging defendant because the case had never been before a jury. It held that jeopardy, under the U.S. Const. Amend V and Tex. Const. art. I. &sect; 14, had not attached, and the prosecution was not barred from re-charging defendant. Similarly, the court held that collateral estoppel also did not apply because defendant was never put in jeopardy in the first case. The case was remanded for the information could be reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that the prosecution's information be reinstated because neither the double jeopardy clause of the United States nor the Texas Constitutions barred prosecution of defendant as no jury was ever empanelled. It also held that collateral estoppel was also not appropriate because defendant must have first showed that jeopardy already attached to be successful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated after the lower court denied his writ of habeas corpus and his motion to dismiss, both based on the argument that because he was not indicted timely, the charge should have been dismissed. The court found that Tex. Gen. Laws 317, 441 (current version at Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 32.01), required that the indictment be presented against a defendant at the next term of the court which was held after his commitment or admission to bail. The court determined that whether the section had been complied with depended upon which court's terms applied. It held that the relevant terms were those of the district court in which the initial appearance, where the decision to detain in custody or hold to bail, was made. Because appellant did not include the name of the court that set his bail, the court held that he failed to meet his burden of showing a violation of the statute. As such, it concluded that it the lower court did not err in denying appellant's writ of habeas corpus or his motion to dismiss.

Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.023(b). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the cap on damages provided in the Texas Tort Claims Act as applied to a personal injury claim against appellee, claiming that the statute violated the open courts doctrine and the equal protection provision under Tex.

The fact that bus transportation was at one time provided by private bus companies did not abrogate the legislature's authority under its general police powers to later reclassify the function of a regional transit authority as exclusively governmental.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his conviction for aggravated sexual assault of a child was improper because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The reviewing court upheld the conviction. A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must prove that counsel's representation fell so below an objective standard of reasonableness that it undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. Here, the lack of an accomplice witness instruction was harmless error, given other detailed corroborating testimony. His counsel's failure to cross-examine the victim's mother was merely a reasonable trial strategy. Additionally, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 8.04 (1994), which disallowed proof of intoxication to negate intent, was constitutional. Intoxication is self-induced, in contrast with a disease or mental defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 363rd Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas) for capital murder while committing a burglary of a habitation, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) (1994). Appellant alleged that the evidence was factually and legally insufficient to establish his specific intent to murder and that he received ineffective counsel due to the discriminatory exclusion of jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of capital murder committed during a burglary in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) (1994). Appellant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he specifically intended to kill the victim. Appellant also alleged that he received ineffective counsel because of the discriminatory exclusion of prospective jurors. Appellant claimed that he did intend to burglarize the house and rape the victim, but when she pulled the gun from under the bed, he accidentally shot her after they struggled. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and held that appellant's use of a gun and his failure to seek medical attention for the victim and the theft from the premises inferred that appellant specifically intended to kill the victim. The court found that one juror was properly excused for cause after she vacillated and stated that her beliefs biased her against appellee state. Appellee state properly used a peremptory challenge to excuse a juror because, in finding racial neutrality in the strike, counsel's failure to seek complete racial information on the jury did not prejudice the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder. The court held that appellant's specific intent to murder was found by his use of a gun, his failure to seek medical attention for the victim, and his theft from the residence after the shooting was committed. The court also held that there were no racially motivated reasons for exclusion of jurors, and that counsel did not commit any errors that prejudiced appellant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the 295th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which denied his claims for an injunction against appellee city to enjoin abatement of the mowing of his grass and for a declaratory judgment that his lawn was not in violation of a penal ordinance, Houston, Tex., Code of Ordinances ch. 10, art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sued appellee city to enjoin abatement of the mowing of his grass, and for a declaratory judgment that his lawn was not in violation of appellee city's ordinance, Houston, Tex., Code of Ordinances ch. 10, art. XI, &sect; 10-451(b)(10) (1985), and for damages for his lost time and expenses. Section 10-451(b)(10) was a criminal misdemeanor ordinance, and appellant was being prosecuted for its violation in municipal court. The district court denied appellant any relief. Appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that a court of equity could not interfere with enforcement of a penal ordinance unless it was unconstitutional and enforcement threatened irreparable injury to personal rights or property rights. The court found that appellant did not argue on appeal that he would have suffered irreparable harm or that the ordinance was unconstitutional, and thus the court held that the district court did not have jurisdiction to interfere with the criminal prosecution. Whether or not appellant violated appellee's ordinance had to be decided by the municipal court. The court found that a number of the other points raised were moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment of the 262nd District Court (Texas) adjudicating him guilty of possession of cocaine for failing to abide by the conditions of probation and sentencing him to 12 years confinement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant plead guilty to possession of less than 28 grams of cocaine, but the trial court deferred a finding of guilt and placed him under the terms and conditions of probation for a period of five years in accordance with the terms of a plea bargain agreement. Two years later, the trial court adjudicated appellant's guilt for failing to abide by the conditions of probation and sentenced him to 12 years confinement. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a punishment hearing before sentencing him to the penitentiary and that his counsel was ineffective when he failed to object to the absence of a punishment hearing. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that although the trial court erred in failing to conduct a second phase punishment hearing after adjudicating the previously deferred finding of guilt, appellant failed to preserve the error by not objecting or filing a motion for a new trial. The court also rejected appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel had called numerous witnesses at the adjudication hearing and had presented testimony aimed at mitigating appellant's punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was tried for aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. He was found guilty and sentenced by a jury after he represented himself pro se, having demanded the discharge of his court appointed counsel and the right to represent himself at trial.

Appellant also argued that the trial court erred in letting the jury view him inside the courtroom wearing restraints. The appeals court affirmed the convictions. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in trying the case with leg restraints on appellant because he had been belligerent and violent during several court hearings, including on the day of trial. The court also ruled that while it was mandatory for the trial judge to provide appellant with a written waiver form to sign pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of credit card abuse and the trial court placed him on community supervision. The state filed a motion to revoke probation, alleging that defendant tampered with governmental records, specifically an application for an identification card, in violation of Tex. Penal &sect; 37.10 (1994). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that &sect; 37.10 was invalid because it was void and overbroad, sought to criminalize actions that were not criminal, and failed to give adequate notice as to what was the penalty for the acts considered a violation. The motion to dismiss was overruled and defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 37.10 was constitutionally vague as to what was a governmental record. The court affirmed the trial court's order revoking defendant's community supervision because &sect; 37.10 was not unconstitutional because defendant had fair notice that a state-issued identification card and the application therefor were issued or received by state government and would have constituted government records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer sought review of an order that denyied his motion for summary judgment and granted the motion for summary judgment of appellee Texas Workforce Commission, formerly known as the Texas Employment Commission (TEC), in an action regarding appellee's administrative order requiring appellant to pay a former employee disputed wages. The court found that, because the trial court's judgment provided that the employee both could and could not recover on his wage claim, the judgment was void for being irreconcilable on its face. On appellee's cross-point regarding jurisdiction, the court held that Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect;61.063(b), which conditioned the right to judicial review of the administrative order on payment of the disputed wages, violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 by unconstitutionally restricting access to the courts. However, because Tex. Lab.

The lower court held a release hearing to determine if appellant would be released to the adult prison facility to complete his sentence or return to the youth detention center until he reached the age of 21. The lower court ordered appellant to be transferred to the adult facility. Upon review, the court affirmed appellant's transfer because the petition for appellant's indictment for capital murder was approved by the grand jury and certified to the lower court and, therefore, satisfied the constitutional requirements. The court held that the transfer was proper because the record supported appellant's conviction for capital murder, that he had shown no remorse for committing the crime, and that appellant had been disruptive and violent at the youth facility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for first degree offense of intentional injury to a child resulting in serious bodily injury pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.04(a)(1)(1994). At trial, defendant required that the trial court include in its charge to the jury the lesser included offense of reckless injury to a child.

On appeal, defendant raised 14 points of error including that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a charge of the lesser included offense. The court held that because defendant requested the charge on the lesser included offense, he could not be heard to complain of the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support such a conviction. As to the other points of error raised by defendant, the court overruled all of them for either lack of support in the record, failure to identify prejudice, no abuse of discretion, failure to preserve for review, lack of improper argument shown, defense of accident no longer viable, and indiscernible argument presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant criminal defendant, convicted of assaulting a police officer, unsuccessfully challenged his conviction on multiple grounds.

The court found that the error in denying appellant permission to cross-examine a prosecution witness about her prior arrests was harmless. The court held that appellant's claim that the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury at the sentencing phase regarding his parole eligibility was waived and was not fundamental error.

Appellant had contended that &sect; 42.08 was unconstitutionally vague. The statute stated that a person committed the offense of abuse of a corpse if, not authorized by law, he intentionally or knowingly disinterred, disturbed, removed, dissected, in whole or in part, carried away, or treated in a seriously offensive manner a human corpse. The court affirmed, holding that it did not consider &sect; 42.08 to be unconstitutionally vague. In particular, a statute was not unconstitutionally vague merely because the words or terms used were not defined. Moreover, the court rejected appellant's argument that literal enforcement of the statute could prevent persons such as nurses, ambulance drivers, and gravediggers from doing their jobs. This argument ignored the clause &quot;not authorized by law&quot; in the first sentence of the section.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother challenged an order from 318th District Court of Midland County (Texas), which terminated the parental rights of appellant as to three children, and which terminated the parent-child relationship between two children and their father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother failed to maintain contact with her children following their placement in state care. This was a violation of her service plan and as a result the state was successful in seeking a termination of her parental rights. The appellate court found that while appellant's behavior did constitute constructive abandonment of her children, the penalty imposed was inappropriate. Under statutes in effect at the time appellant violated her service plan, the penalty for this conduct would have been an inability for appellant to regain managing conservatorship of her children. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001(N), which implemented the penalty of termination of parental rights for constructive abandonment, became effective nearly a year after the date that the requisite statutory period of abandonment commenced for appellant. The appellate court held that the statute was applied retroactively in violation of appellant's constitutional protections. That portion of the trial court's order terminating appellant's parental rights was reversed and remanded to the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a decision of the 276th Judicial District Court, Morris County, Texas, which convicted appellant for the delivery of marihuana, denied a writ of habeas corpus for failure to present a timely indictment under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01, 28.061 (1989), and denied a motion to quash the indictment on speedy trial grounds under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.05 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted for the delivery of marihuana, assessed a punishment of two years confinement, and fined. Defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus, which sought a dismissal for failure to present a timely indictment under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01, 28.061 (1989). Defendant also filed a motion to quash the indictment on speedy trial grounds under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.05 (1977). The trial court denied appellant's writ and motion. Defendant sought review, but the court affirmed the trial court. The court held that under art. 32.01 a defendant was required to be indicted by the next term of the trial court after commitment or admission to bail. Appellant was arrested and released on bond during the January 1996 term of the trial court and was timely indicted during the next term in May 1996. The complaint was moot, however, because appellant did not file before the indictment. There was no right to counsel before indictment. The state showed good cause for the delay. The right to a speedy trial was not violated under the balancing test because appellant actively sought continuances and did not timely assert the speedy trial right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that convicted appellant for the delivery of marihuana, and the writ of habeas corpus was properly denied because the indictment was timely filed in the next term after appellant's arrest. Appellant's right to a speedy trial was not violated under the balancing test because appellant sought continuances and the right was not timely asserted.</SPAN></P>

After the court's review, the state filed motions for rehearing and for consideration, claiming the court did not have jurisdiction. The court held that it had jurisdiction to review the timeliness of an indictment as a habeas corpus appeal because timeliness was not a sufficiency issue; it was more akin to a limitations issue. The court determined that Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect;32.01 and Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect;28.061 did not unduly interfere with the prosecutor's preparation of a case because it was similar to the interference of statutes of limitations. The court determined that a prosecutor could request an extension of time in which to file an indictment and held that while a speedy indictment is not expressly guaranteed, a prosecutor cannot hold a person under arrest or its equivalent indefinitely.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. According to the appeals court, the rules of appellate procedure list specific grounds for which a new trial must be granted. The appeals court held that the grounds included when a juror had been bribed to convict or was guilty of any other corrupt conduct, and when the jury had engaged in such misconduct that the accused did not receive a fair and impartial trial. The appeals court continued and held that a juror's intentional misrepresentation of material information in the voir dire process was grounds for a new trial. In addition, the appeals court held that trial court had discretion to grant a new trial for other reasons not listed in the appellate rules.

On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to set aside the arbitrator's award. The court affirmed, holding that the arbitrator's award exceeded the scope of his authority.

Appellant alleged on appeal that he was denied his right to a jury trial. The right to jury trial in a civil matter was not absolute; rather, the right had to be perfected by requesting a jury and paying the jury trial fee. Even so, the right could be waived by failing to object when the trial court proceeded without a jury, which appellant failed to do.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the County Court of Tyler County (Texas), which convicted him of driving while intoxicated. Defendant contended the court erred because his federal and state rights to due process were violated by the police officers' failure to act upon his request for a blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for driving while intoxicated. A game warden saw defendant driving into a park at 1:00 a.m., administered field sobriety tests that indicated defendant was intoxicated, and called in sheriff's officers who took defendant to the county jail. Defendant agreed to take a breath test, but the officers could not make the machine work. Defendant testified that he asked for a blood test, but none of the officers recalled the request and an officer testified that a blood test was not performed because defendant was belligerent. Defendant therefore had no objective evidence with which to refute the officers' opinions regarding his inebriated state. The appellate court affirmed the judgment and sentence because as a prerequisite to presenting a complaint for review, the record must demonstrate the complaint was made to the lower court by a timely request, objection, or motion. Holding the lower court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's motion for new trial, the court held claims presented by defendant for the first time on appeal involved constitutional rights for which he sought no relief from the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated.

The court held that the claims defendant presented for the first time on appeal also involved constitutional rights for which he sought no relief from the lower court, and was precluded from raising on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of an order from the 252nd District Court, Jefferson County (Texas), which entered her guilty plea to aggravated kidnapping and assessed punishment at 10 years' confinement. Appellant contended that she had immunity, based upon an agreement with police in one county, and that denial of her suppression motion was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant entered into an immunity agreement with the county sheriff. Another county brought charges based on the information given by appellant to the other county sheriff, on the charge of aggravated kidnapping. Appellant alleged that the trial court committed reversible error by not granting her immunity based on the prosecution's promise of immunity from prosecution in exchange for information of a crime unknown to the state. The court found that the immunity agreement was exclusive with the county sheriff and did not apply to the other county. The trial court found that she could be prosecuted because she failed to obtain district court approval or the other county's approval of the agreement. Also, appellant failed to show that the complained of evidence was obtained through the use of information she gave in her confession, which the trial court held was inadmissible. The court did not find that any of the complained of evidence, other than her confession, was illegally obtained thus constituting fruit of the poisonous tree. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping, based upon her guilty plea and assessed punishment at 10 years' confinement. The court did not find that any of the complained of evidence, other than her confession, was illegally obtained, and suppression was therefore properly denied. Appellant failed to get district approval for immunity, which was not applicable between counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was arrested and charged with the offense of deadly conduct in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.05 (1994). Appellant was released on bail but was not indicted until a year later. Appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and sought to have the indictment dismissed under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01, which required the discharge of indictments not returned before the end of the next term of court after which a defendant was confined or admitted to bail. The trial court denied the petition and the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court held that art. 28.061 violated the separation of powers provision of Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 because it impermissibly intruded on the prosecution's exclusive discretion to prepare cases for presentation to the grand jury. Because art. 28.061 was unconstitutional and the grand jury returned an indictment against appellant before the trial court ruled on appellant's habeas corpus petition, the court determined that appellant's claim of an untimely indictment was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed the dismissal of the indictment against defendant from the 380th District Court, Collin County, Texas, a dismissal pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA), Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.14 (1979). The state contended that the trial court erred in dismissal because the 180-day time limit had not expired, the delay was agreed to, excludable time periods were included, and the IADA was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for the property theft. At that time, he was incarcerated in a state correctional institution. Pursuant to the indictment's detainer, defendant was moved to a county justice center. Over five months later, the trial court held a hearing on defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA), art. IV(c). The trial court granted the motion, finding that defendant had been in the county justice center for a period of more than 120 days. The trial court amended its order, finding that defendant's dismissal was warranted under a different article and that 180 days had elapsed without justifiable excuse or delay attributable to the state or defendant. The court reversed the trial court's order, finding that defendant's letter to the county district clerk did not satisfy the notice requirements of the IADA and the 180 day deadline did not begin to run. In addition, the record showed that defense counsel agreed to postponements totaling a period of 107 days, a period sufficient to toll the 180 day period well past the date the trial court dismissed the indictment and the day the case was set for jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment because defendant's letter to the county district clerk did not satisfy the notice requirements of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act. Also, the 180 day statutory period was tolled 107 days by agreement of defense counsel, a time sufficient to put the case well past the date the trial court dismissed the indictment and the day the case was set for jury trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also claimed that the trial court erred in denying the motion because the presiding judge was not the elected judge for the trial court. However, the court found that appellant offered no proof to support his claim. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for a mistrial after a witness gave improper testimony because the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the remark. The court also held that the trial court was correct in excluding testimony about a dispatcher's conversation with the teller. Additionally, the court overruled appellant's points of error related to opinion testimony, probable cause, closing arguments, and appellant's sentence. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a prison inmate who sued appellee guards for falsely charging him with a disciplinary case for creating a disturbance, argued trial court error in failing to sanction appellees for the attorney general's lack of strict compliance with the rules of substitution when appellees' counsel changed. The court disagreed, ruling that appellant failed to show how appellees' counsel's failure to file the appropriate documents injured him. Moreover, the refusal to sanction appellees for not serving him with their exceptions to his motion for summary judgment was proper; the exceptions had been sent to his address of record because appellant did not file with the court his new prison address. Moreover, evidence showed that appellant received appellees' cross-motion for summary judgment and that appellant's motion to strike it was properly dismissed, given that the substituted counsel's formal motion for substitution was filed and approved before a ruling on the strike was made. Finally, appellant's challenge of the disciplinary procedures used to impose punishments was not cognizable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 absent any allegation that the punishments had been invalidated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a decision from the 334th District Court, Harris County (Texas), contending the lower court erred when it denied recognition to and enforcement of a Canadian judgment against appellee under the Uniform Foreign Country Money-Judgment Recognition Act and when it refused to give full faith and credit through the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act to a Louisiana judgment that recognized the same Canadian judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Canadian court entered a judgment that appellee infringed appellant's Canadian patents. Appellant obtained a judgment from a Louisiana court that the Canadian judgment was executory. Appellant later filed the Canadian judgment for recognition under the Uniform Foreign Country Money-Judgment Recognition Act, (UFCMJRA), Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36.003, 36.005(b)(3), (7), in the trial court in Texas. The trial court granted appellee's motion for non-recognition. The trial court also refused recognition of the Louisiana judgment under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, because it regarded this as a &quot;back door&quot; attempt to domesticate the Canadian judgment. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred if it concluded as a matter of law that recognition of the Canadian judgment should be denied based on lack of reciprocity under the UFCMJRA. However, the Louisiana judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit because the recognition of foreign country judgments involved looking behind the judgment to evaluate both the law upon which it was based and the jurisdictional environment in which it was rendered. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the court refused to recognize the Louisiana judgment, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court denying recognition to and enforcement of the Canadian judgment because there appeared to be reciprocity in Canadian enforcement of judgments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant juvenile was convicted of capital murder and given a life sentence after the juvenile court waived jurisdiction and transferred her case to the district court. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;54.02(f) (1996) was constitutional and did not violate appellant's rights to equal treatment under the law. The court held that the fact that the state had a capital murder facility exclusively for males was not the factor that precluded appellant from being tried as a juvenile. The court also ruled that appellant's contention that her written confession was improperly obtained was not preserved for review because the issue was never presented to the trial court. The court further concluded that appellant was not denied her right to be accompanied by a third party under Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. &sect;52.025(c) because she was with her husband during the proceedings. Finally, the court held that appellant's confession to her husband was not coerced, there was no evidence that her husband was being used as an agent of the police, and the lower court properly admitted the statements into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the district court's denial of petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner was arrested for sexual indecency with a child and was released the same day on bail.

Proc. art. 32.01 on the grounds that he was not indicted at the very next term of the grand jury. On review the court found that the subject article was restricted by its terms to persons who were restrained for an offense and not charged in an indictment or information. Before he was indicted, he was entitled under that rule to have an order made that would have discharged him from prosecution, but at the time petitioner invoked the article it no longer had application to him because he had since come under indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient sought review of a decision of the 153rd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which entered summary judgment for appellees, hospitals and doctor, on the basis of limitations under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (Supp. 1998), in appellant's suit claiming damages for medical malpractice and fraud in psychiatric treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient was treated for depression and substance abuse by appellees, hospitals and doctor. After release, appellant was married for a short time to a hospital substance abuse counselor, whom she accused of abusing her during treatment. More than five years after her last treatment, appellant brought suit against appellees, claiming fraud and malpractice. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees under the limitations provision of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i (Supp. 1998), and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that appellant's claims against appellees accrued on the last day of treatment, and that appellant's deposition established that she was on inquiry notice of any alleged fraud five years before filing suit, so that whether subject to the two-year limitations period of art. 4590i or the four-year period for common law fraud, the claims were time-barred. The court also held that duress by the counselor, a third party, could not toll limitations as to appellees, and that art. 4590i did not violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment of the 22nd District Court (Texas) convicting him of theft of property valued at $ 750.00 or more, but less than $ 20,000.00. Appellant argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish an essential element of the offense, the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, and that the evidence was factually insufficient to prove the tractor's fair market value was greater than $ 750.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted by a jury of the theft of property valued at $ 750 or more, but less than $ 20,000. The evidence at trial established that appellant approached the complainant about taking her tractor in lieu of money she owed him under a contract, but she declined. Five days later, the complainant returned home to find the tractor missing. When she confronted appellant about the tractor, appellant assured her that he would return it, but never did. On appeal, appellant argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, and that the evidence was factually insufficient to prove the tractor's fair market value was greater than $ 750. The appeals court affirmed because any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also ruled that although there were conflicting opinions as to the value of the tractor, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding. The court reasoned that the owner testified the tractor was an antique valued at $ 1,500 and appellant had offered to take the tractor in lieu of a $ 1,900 contracted agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court affirmed appellant's theft conviction because any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that the jury was entitled to infer appellant's intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, from evidence that he took the property without the owner's permission and never returned it, despite his promise to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bail bondsmen filed a petition against the Texas Attorney General and appellee sheriff, individually and as county sheriff, alleging the unconstitutionality of collecting pre-conviction bail bond fees. Appellee sought summary judgment based on official immunity and limitations. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, holding that a two-year statute of limitations barred appellants' claim. Appellants argued that the original petition included three causes of actions; a taking in violation, an extortion claim, and collection of a debt action. Appellants conceded that a two-year statute of limitations governed the taking and extortion causes of action. The collection of debt was governed by a four-year statute of limitations, but the court found that the facts alleged in appellants' petition failed to give notice of a claim for the collection of a debt. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court did not err in applying a two-year statute of limitations and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment granting summary judgment in favor of appellee sheriff was affirmed because the trial court properly applied a two-year statute of limitations where appellant bail bondmen had merely pleaded extortion and taking causes of actions, which did not give fair and adequate notice of a debt cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment of the 202nd Judicial District Court, Bowie County (Texas), which revoked his community supervision.

Furthermore, the court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by revoking appellant's community supervision because the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that he violated the terms of his community supervision where he failed to report his address change within the requisite 48 hours, and where he failed to pay the supervision fees during the time period that he was gainfully employed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a decision of the District Court of Comal County (Texas), which convicted him of the state jail felony offense of criminal nonsupport, a violation of Tex. Pen. Code &sect; 25.05 (1994). Appellant challenged both the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant and his wife divorced and the court entered an earnings withholding order for child support. Two years later, appellant was charged with failing to provide support for his daughters. During most, but not all, of the time listed in the charge to the jury, appellant was employed and his employer withheld child support but in an amount insufficient to cover his monthly obligation. Appellant was convicted of criminal nonsupport. The court affirmed finding that even if the violation of a child support order did not automatically translate into a violation of the statute, a rational trier of fact could have found appellant knowingly or intentionally failed to provide support during at least some of the time at issue. The court held that even if not all of the months of nonsupport for which appellant was charged were not proved, he was also on notice of allegations of nonsupport during the other months and had no reason to be surprised by evidence presented to support those allegations. The court found that because the evidence established appellant's failure to provide support for his minor children in at least some of the months, it was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction was affirmed because, even if the violation of a child support order did not automatically translate into a violation of the criminal nonsupport statute, there was sufficient evidence to find appellant intentionally or knowingly failed to provide support for his children during some of the time in question. The judgment was not so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed a decision from the 125th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted partial summary judgment for defendant doctor based on the two-year statute of limitations in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 in plaintiffs' medical malpractice and loss consortium actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wife sued defendant doctor for failing to diagnose the cause of her multiple personality disorder. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment for defendant in plaintiff's medical malpractice action and plaintiff's husband's loss of consortium action. Plaintiffs' actions were barred by the statute of limitations in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i. The two-year statute of limitations began April 18, 1992. Plaintiffs did not file their action until 1995. Plaintiffs' summary judgment proof, asserted to contest defendant's motion for summary judgment, was incompetent. Plaintiffs' submission of a social security letter stating she was incompetent was unsworn and constituted hearsay. Two doctors' affidavits contending plaintiff was incompetent were conclusory. Plaintiffs therefore failed to raise a factual issue to preclude summary judgment for defendant on the statute of limitations. The court further held that the general statutory tolling provision for persons under a legal disability, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.001, were inapplicable to medical malpractice claims under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for defendant doctor in plaintiffs' medical malpractice and loss of consortium. Plaintiffs' summary judgment proof concerning her legal disability was incompetent because it was based on hearsay and conclusory allegations and therefore did not raise a factual issue as to whether the two-year statute of limitations applied.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 42.07(a)(4) and (a)(7)(A) challenged the revocation of his probation, alleging that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that he violated his probation, and that it was error to deny his motion to quash certain allegations in the state's revocation motion. On appeal the court affirmed the revocation. The evidence showed that appellant drove near complainant's house to make visual contact with her and called her, and that this conduct was prohibited by the no contact condition attached to appellant's probation. The court found that the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to have found by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant violated his probation, and, as such, it was not an abuse of its discretion to revoke appellant's probation. The court determined that allegations contained in a motion to revoke probation did not need to be set out with the same particularity as those of an indictment, but that a revocation motion was sufficient if it gave the probationer fair notice of the allegations against him. The court found that the state's motion met this standard.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b), which prohibited an appeal from a revocation of deferred adjudication, and complaining that his case had originally been improperly referred to a magistrate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was brought before a magistrate and he entered a guilty plea to a charge of burglary of a habitation. He was placed on deferred adjudication and, the next day, his case was referred to the same magistrate, without objection. Defendant subsequently violated his probation and the trial court revoked his deferred adjudication and entered a conviction and sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Defendant appealed, arguing that the original referral of his case to the magistrate was improper and that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b), which prohibited an appeal from a revocation of deferred adjudication, violated his equal protection and due process rights under the federal and Texas constitutions. In affirming with respect to the magistrate issue, the court ruled that defendant failed to preserve that issue for appeal by making a timely objection. In dismissing the appeal concerning the constitutional claim, the court ruled that the provision at issue deprived it of jurisdiction to consider the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a decision of the District Court of Burnet County, 33rd Judicial District (Texas), which convicted and sentenced him, based on a jury verdict, on charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20.04, 22.02 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant assaulted complainant in her apartment. After going to give a statement to the police, complainant found the apartment vandalized. Appellant later called and told complainant that he would kill her if she pressed charges. The next day, at complainant's employer's residence, appellant appeared, assaulted complainant, took complainant's baby, fired a shotgun several times through the door, and drove away. After a chase and a standoff with police, appellant surrendered. The trial court convicted and sentenced appellant on charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of the first day's incidents to give context to appellant's behavior the next day, under Tex. R. Evid. 404(b). The court also held that because safe release was not an element of the offense of aggravated kidnapping but merely a factor that mitigated punishment, it was not unconstitutional for Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 20.04(d) to place the burden of persuasion to show safe release on appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting and sentencing appellant on charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault, because contextual evidence of appellant's extraneous conduct was properly admitted and it was appropriate for appellant to bear the burden of proof on safe release of the kidnap victim.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended error in the trial court's overruling his motion to quash the indictment and motion to suppress his statement to the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant first asserted that the indictment for the murder of a one-year-old was unconstitutional because the indictment did not allege that he knew his victim was under six, he has in essence been held to strict liability standards for his crime. The court overruled this error because it had previously held that the statute had no knowledge requirement, beyond the requirement that the defendant knowingly killed the victim, to find a person guilty under this provision. Appellant also claimed that the trial judge erred in refusing to suppress his statement regarding the death of the other victim claiming he made this statement shortly after he was arrested for a previous murder. Appellant claimed that, because he was arrested as a juvenile, he should have been given the admonishments statutorily required for juveniles. The court affirmed his conviction and found that admonishment under the criminal code was appropriate because appellant was seventeen when he was being questioned and he was seventeen when he murdered the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's conviction because it found no errors by the trial court in denying his motion to suppress his statement because he was at the statutory age where he could be punished as an adult. The court had also rejected his argument as to knowledge of the child's age prior to the murder because knowledge was not statutorily required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with the first murder and entered a plea of no contest. The lower court deferred adjudication of guilt and imposed a sentenced of 10 years probation. Appellant was then charged with a second murder. The lower court granted the state's motion to adjudicate the first murder and held the hearing during the trial for the second murder. The lower court revoked appellant's probation and convicted her for the first and second murder. The court affirmed because during the adjudication of the second murder, appellant claimed self-defense and that she did not intend to kill the victim and, therefore, the state was permitted to introduce extraneous offense evidence in regard to the first murder to refute appellant's explanation. The court held that the first and second murders were substantially similar in that they both involved a fatal stabbing and, therefore, the evidence in regard to the first murder was relevant in the adjudication of the second murder. The court held that appellant failed to preserve error on the claim that her plea to the first murder was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's convictions of the first and second murders because evidence of the first murder was properly admissible as extraneous offense evidence in the trial of the second murder because it was relevant to refute appellant's claim of self-defense and that she lacked the requisite intent. The court found that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate was found guilty of theft and assessed punishment of five years deferred adjudication and imposed a fine. Appellee state filed a motion to adjudicate guilt, claiming that appellant had violated the terms of probation.

Appellant complained of the trial court's denial of his motion and the legality of the sentence imposed. On appeal, the court dismissed appellant inmate's appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he did not comply with the extra notice requirements of the Texas rules of appellate procedure and that he did not have the trial court's permission to appeal, which was required unless appellant was challenging a matter raised in a pretrial motion or alleging a jurisdictional defect. However, because appellant sought reversal based on appellee's failure to use due diligence in apprehending him and the legality of the sentence assessed against him, the court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Instead of appealing his suspension to the particular commission under Tex.

The trial court granted appellee's cross-motion for summary judgment, declaring that appellant city was obligated to proceed with a proceeding before a privately appointed examiner. The appellate court reversed and held that appellants, city and city officials, were entitled to summary judgment. As part of a recodification of a prior statute that applied to appellant city, Tex. Local Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 143.053 (1988) applied to appellant city even though its citizens did not vote to adopt it. However, insofar as the statutory provision conferred legislative authority on a private entity to determine the standards for selecting qualified and neutral examiners to review disciplinary actions by a police department, it conferred legislative authority on a private entity in contravention of Tex.

After the second motion to adjudicate guilt, the trial court sentenced him to 10 years confinement.

The sentence range was also reduced. Appellant contended that the trial court erred by failing to sentence him within the appropriate punishment range. The court concluded that the trial court correctly sentenced appellant within the punishment range for a third degree felony because amendments made to the penal code were not retroactive. Appellant also argued that his 10 year sentence was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual because it was disproportionate to the offense he committed. Appellant did not raise this argument in the trial court either when punishment was assessed or in his motion for new trial.

The court found that appellant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until three days before the trial, which gave rise to the implication that he did not want a speedy trial because the matter had been pending for 34 months. The court noted further that appellant had been unable to show harm. The court found that appellant did not object to the state's final argument and waived his right to appeal. The court found the defect in the indictment was without merit as the issue of car ownership was not a serious issue.

The trial court held a hearing, waived jurisdiction, and transferred appellant to have been tried as an adult. Appellant contended that the return of service falsely recited that a true copy of the petition and motion to waive jurisdiction was attached, therefore jurisdiction was improperly invoked. The court stated that an officer's return that was valid on its face carried a presumption of the truth of the facts stated on the return and of regularity. The court also stated that appellant could have rebutted this presumption, but his testimony alone was insufficient. The court also held that appellant's argument that the admission of hearsay evidence during a transfer hearing violated his due process rights and fundamental fairness had previously been rejected by the appellate court. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the decision of the 176th District Court, Harris County, Texas, to revoke his probation. Appellee state sought to revoke the probation on grounds appellant had failed to remain under custodial supervision or pay restitution and extradition costs. Appellant contended, inter alia, that the statute under which he was originally convicted, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.04(a), was void and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled guilty to theft of service, for retaining a rental car beyond the expiration of the rental period. His sentenced included 10-years probation. Appellee state sought to revoke appellant's probation on two prior occasions. In the third motion to revoke, appellee alleged appellant had not remained under custodial supervision or paid restitution and extradition cost. The trial court revoked appellant's community supervision for failure to remain under custodial supervision and imposed the 10-year sentence. Appellant sought review alleging, inter alia, that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.04(a), under which he was originally charged and convicted, was unconstitutional and void. The court held the statute was not void or unconstitutional. The statute did not constitute imprisonment for debt, because a defendant was punished for acting with intent to avoid paying for services rendered, not for failure to pay for services rendered. The court also held the written sentence controlled over the court's verbal statements; the motions for revocation did not violate double jeopardy; and there was no evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's revocation of appellant's probation on grounds appellant had failed to remain under custodial supervision or pay restitution and extradition costs. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional as appellant's punishment was for acting with intent to avoid a debt. Appellant's other claims of error were also overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant energy company was the operator of an oil, gas, and mineral lease on land annexed by appellee city. Appellee surface owner purchased the surface rights to the land.

Appellant argued that the lease constituted consent. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellant, but later stayed its judgment. Appellee surface owner filed motion for a new trial and asked the court to take judicial notice of the amendment of Ordinance 96 that deleted the consent requirement provision. The trial court dismissed the suit as moot and appellant sought review. The court affirmed dismissal of appellant's suit because appellant had no vested right under the ordinance where appellant did not meet the consent requirement and the amended ordinance was not applied retroactively to appellant. The court held that the summary judgment in appellant's favor was a nullity as it was supplanted by the later order dismissing the case as moot, and appellant was not entitled to rely on it.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant's failure to resist the dismissal of a venire member or to rehabilitate her caused him to waive any error on that issue. The court also determined that appellant's failure to present either a Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 404(b) objection or an extraneous offense objection to the admission of certain photographs failed to preserve the issue for appeal. The court concluded that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review after he was convicted of sexually assaulting a child under 17 years of age. By six points of error, he challenged his conviction, contesting the sufficiency of the evidence, the erroneous admission of prejudicial evidence, as well as the trial court's instruction to the jury. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the charged offense. The court also found that, during trial, appellant made no attempt to exclude references to alleged prejudicial extraneous offenses; therefore, he waived the error. Further, the court concluded that there was nothing facially incorrect about the trial court's jury instructions, and appellant failed to demonstrate any undue prejudice from the charge. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that pro se litigants were required to follow the same procedural rules as other litigants and that because each of her motions was not accompanied by a sworn affidavit, as required by Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged a decision from the 206th Judicial District Court of Hidalgo County (Texas), which rendered judgment against it for damages resulting from the arrest and abuse of appellee minor child and his parents, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee parents and child sued appellant city, police department, chief and officers alleging excessive force, malicious conspiracy, and violations of child's rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Appellees dropped the claims against the individuals and the jury returned awards in favor of appellees. On appeal, appellant city argued there was insufficient evidence to support the awards. The court found no evidence to support the awards in favor of parents. In viewing the decision in the light most favorable to the verdict, the court found the officers actions amounted to excessive force. It also ruled that evidence was relevant which showed that defendant chief, as the policymaker for the police department, had a pattern and practice of abusing his position of authority and acting outside legal parameters, which was necessary to prove the &sect; 1983 claim. Since the claim was one for personal injury, appellee child's mental anguish was compensable, even in the absence of any physical injury. The court also found appellee had been wrongfully deprived of prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the decision which found appellant city liable to appellee child for all injuries, including mental anguish, he sustained as a result of defendant officer's use of excessive force. The court reversed the decision awarding damages to appellee parents, because neither had been injured or deprived of rights, and appellee child was entitled to prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state sought review of an order from the County Court at Law Number Two, Collin County (Texas), which suppressed all of its evidence against appellee, in a shoplifting case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a shoplifting case, the state argued that the trial court erred in suppressing evidence obtained by store employees because those individuals were not law enforcement officers or otherwise acting as agents of the state. Further, the state contended that appellant's statements made to a police officer were voluntary and not the result of a custodial interrogation and, therefore should not have been suppressed. The court found that the store employees were not acting as agents of the state and did not commit any illegal act in obtaining evidence from appellee. Consequently, there was no basis in the record for suppressing any evidence obtained prior to the arrival of the police. However, the court found that suppression of appellee's statements made to the police was proper because appellee was subject to custodial interrogation, and the officer's questioning exceeded any incidental interrogation. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was indicted for indecency with a child and aggravated sexual assault of a child.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 (1989) because the prosecution untimely filed an indictment. The prosecution failed to meet its burden of showing that good cause existed for the late filing where its evidence indicated that it was merely trying to better prepare its case for the grand jury. However, the prosecution was not barred from refiling the indictment. Although the legislature had ultimate authority of judicial administration under Tex. Const. art V, &sect; 31 (1985), art. 28.061 shifted the focus from releasing the accused for an untimely filing to infringing the prosecution's ability to indict within a certain time frame by barring any further prosecution and thus it violated the separation of powers doctrine. Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. This rendered any dismissal temporary, permitted the prosecution to refile, and because appellant failed to raise an art. 32.01 complaint the issue was moot.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, concluding that the trial court properly limited defense counsel's cross-examination of several witnesses because the information counsel sought to elicit was either irrelevant or cumulative. The court further ruled that the prosecutor's comments in closing argument did not warrant reversal because the prosecutor properly commented on the evidence and any prejudice arising from improper comments was cured by the judge's instructions. The court also rejected appellant's claim that the prosecution suppressed crime scene evidence, concluding that the police never seized the evidence and that even if the failure to retrieve the evidence could be considered suppression, no harm occurred as counsel was aware of the evidence from the outset and the jury was informed that the items were at the scene.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the language in dispute in &sect; 415.053 was to provide an effective date for the application of the statute to newly elected officers. The court held there was no conflict between &sect; 415.053 and Tex.

Appellant was not denied procedural due process rights because he did receive notice, was given a trial, and had the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examination witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought interlocutory review of a decision of the 92nd District Court of Hidalgo (Texas), which issued a temporary injunction prohibiting appellant from swearing in a newly elected commissioner upon appellee former commissioner's forfeiture of his office under Alamo City Charter art. II, &sect; 6, due to lack of attendance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee former commissioner was automatically removed from the board of commissioners, pursuant to appellant city's charter, for failure to attend four consecutive meetings and eight meetings total within an anniversary year. Appellee thereafter filed suit to enjoin the election and seating of a new commissioner; the trial court granted a temporary injunction, and appellant sought interlocutory review. On appeal, the court held that although the trial court could have granted injunctive relief if the automatic forfeiture provision had violated appellee's due process rights or the Open Meetings Act, no such violation had occurred. A postforfeiture hearing was sufficient to protect appellee's due process rights because his interest paled in comparison to the need to fill the vacancy and ensure that the citizens were represented, and because a factual dispute as to the absences was unlikely. Furthermore, due to the fact that the forfeiture provision required no action by the board, the Open Meetings Act did not apply to the actual forfeiture. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and rendered judgment that the order of injunction be dissolved.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also claimed the trial court committed reversible error by having assessed the sentence when he was not present at the hearing, and was not shown to have been absent voluntarily. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 33.03 (1989) required a defendant's presence at a felony trial. However, if absence was voluntary, the trial may have proceeded. The trial court had discretion to have decided voluntariness. Appellant could have presented evidence that explained his absence, but he had not, so the trial court had not abused its discretion when it assessed punishment. Appellant then argued error in the assessment of a maximum sentence. However, appellant had not objected at sentencing, nor moved for a new trial, so he waived such an objection.</SPAN></P>

A voluntary plea without an agreed recommendation waived all non-jurisdictional errors which may have occurred before the entry of appellant's plea.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate challenged an order by the 12th District Court, Walker County, Texas, which dismissed his cause of action when he failed to comply with the trial court's orders granting special exceptions and requiring appellant to replead within 30 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate contended that due to a conspiracy by appellees he did not receive appellees' documents relative to their summary judgment motion on his cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 until after the trial court granted summary judgment. The trial court granted special exceptions relative to appellant's failure to meet formal pleading requirements and ordered appellant to replead within 30 days in his cause of action for conspiracy and violation under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and I. Special exceptions could not inject new factual propositions that did not appear in the petition. The court held that appellees fully complied with Tex. R. Civ. P. 91 by pointing out defects and omissions in the allegations in the pleadings. The court found that no hearing prior to dismissal was required under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. &sect; 14.003. However, the court reversed the judgment because the trial court erred in dismissing the lawsuit for failure to replead in conformance with Tex. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded for further proceedings because appellant's cause of action accrued prior to the effective date of a statute and the trial court improperly granted special exceptions pertinent to the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's rulings that appellee did not file a demurrer, and special exceptions were proper to correct the failure to observe formal pleading requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, decedent's estate representative, challenged a summary judgment of the County Civil Court at Law Number One, Harris County (Texas), granted in favor of appellee, an ambulance company, against appellant in a negligence action to recover damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, decedent's estate representative, brought a negligence action against appellee, an ambulance company, to recover damages. The court reversed the trial court judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The trial court erred in applying the two year limitations period contained in the Medial Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1997), to bar appellant's action because appellee failed to establish as a matter of law that this provision applied as a valid limitations defense. Appellee's summary judgment proof was insufficient to invoke this limitations provision because it failed to establish that appellee was a health care provider under art. 4590i, &sect; 1.03(a)(3) (Supp. 1997). Therefore, the court held that appellant's action was timely brought under the tolling provisions of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect;16.062(a) (1997). The court found that the Emergency Medical Service Act, Tex. Admin. Code. Ann. &sect;197.5(c) (1997), did not support appellee's position.

Appellee sought review of the denial of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee owner acquired undeveloped commercial and residential lots in a subdivision. Appellee filed suit after appellant district assessed taxes by valuing each individual lot. The lower court found that Tex. Tax Code &sect; 23.12(a) (Supp. 1997) (&sect;23.12) required real estate inventory to be valued as one unit instead of the sum of individual lot values. Appellant sought review, and appellee sought review of the denial of attorney's fees. The court found that &sect;23.12 was not unconstitutional. It defined inventory as unoccupied residential real property held in the ordinary course of business. Tex. Tax Code &sect; 23.01(b) (1992) (&sect;23.01) provided that property appraisal was to be based on the individual characteristics that affected the property's market value. The court found that under &sect;23.01, appellee's property had to be valued as a unit. Two appraisers' testimony was sufficient evidence to support the lower court's assessment of property value. The lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellee attorney's fees because there was no finding that appellee had any tax savings, which served as a cap on fees under Tex. Tax Code &sect; 42.29 (1992). The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment in appellee owner's favor was affirmed because appellant district had statutory authority to assess taxes against appellees' ownership of undeveloped commercial and residential lots in a subdivision as one unit, not individually. The lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellee attorney fees where the award was discretionary and there was no showing that appellee had tax savings as a result of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with aggravated burglary, and a trial proceeded before a jury.

Appellant filed an application for writ of habeas corpus, claiming that double jeopardy precluded his re-trial. The lower court denied the application, and the court affirmed the denial. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 36.29(c) (1997) required the lower court to discharge the jury when a member became disabled after the charge had been read. Appellant did not raise an objection when the mistrial was declared in chambers or when the lower court announced the mistrial in open court. The court held that appellant's consent to the mistrial could be inferred from appellant's actions, and because appellant consented, a re-trial did not violate appellant's constitutional protections against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged an order from the 117th District Court of Nueces County (Texas), which entered convictions against him for intoxication manslaughter and driving while intoxicated, arising from the death of a baby girl that had been born alive, at the mother's pregnancy of seven and one-half months, from an emergency caesarian section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant crashed into a car driven by a woman who was seven and one-half months pregnant. An emergency caesarian section was performed, and a live baby girl was born. The baby later died due to injury from the collision. Appellant was convicted of intoxication manslaughter and driving while intoxicated, and challenged both convictions. On review, the court found that, in applying the statutory definition of &quot;has been born and is alive&quot; to the facts, the finding that the victim was indeed an &quot;individual&quot; under the criminal law of Texas was sufficient to sustain an indictment and conviction under the intoxication manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.08 (1994). Nor was the statute unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts, as appellant accepted the risk that he might cause the death of another and be subject to a conviction by driving intoxicated. There was no double jeopardy argument as to the driving while intoxicated charge, because the conviction for intoxication manslaughter had been appealed at the time appellant filed his special plea, and thus was not a final conviction when the former charge came before the trial court. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's convictions for intoxication manslaughter and driving while intoxicated were affirmed. The finding that the infant victim born and alive for a period before dying from injuries due to the car collision caused by appellant was sufficient to sustain a conviction under the intoxication manslaughter statute, which was not unconstitutionally vague. Nor was there any ground for appellant's special plea of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the denial of summary judgment and declaration of entitlement to office, concluding the authority to grant relief in a quo warranto action was exceeded by the declaration that appellee was entitled to hold office instead of his appointed successor. The court determined appellee had been lawfully removed from the mayoral office, the successor was lawfully appointed before the quo warranto action began, and the refusal to vacate the office rendered appellee a usurper. The court concluded the removal procedure used by the special &quot;court&quot; composed of alderman adhered to applicable statutory procedural requirements and was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a decision from the 124th Judicial District Court, Gregg County (Texas), which revoked his community supervision. Appellant contended that the trial court failed to credit him for time spent in jail following the arrest for his crime, or for jail time following his revocation arrest under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Appellant was later arrested when the state sought to revoke his community supervision for failure to pay fees, to report, or to perform community service. The revocation hearing was held six months after the arrest, but no jail-time credit was given. The court again found error, holding Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 15(h)(2) (Supp. 1997) to be unconstitutional under the due course of law provisions of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, because it was punitive in light of the right to waiver of a revocation hearing, where time otherwise spent awaiting hearing could be applied directly to a sentence. After finding sufficient evidence, the court affirmed the revocation but remanded with instructions to credit appellant with jail time served while awaiting his guilty plea and while awaiting his revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the revocation of appellant's community supervision, but remanded for the trial court to credit appellant with jail time served following his initial arrest, and also for jail time served while awaiting his revocation hearing. The court found that the Fourteenth Amendment and the Texas Constitution required such credit, and a statute making such credit discretionary was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the county law enforcement officials had misinterpreted the TCSA, and thus there was no need to determine whether it was preempted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed defendant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

Ann. art. 42.12 (1997) was unconstitutional. On review, the court found that art. 42.12 governed deferred adjudication and clearly stated that no appeal could have been taken from a determination under art. 42.12. Therefore, the court simply had no jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal. The court noted that even if art. 42.12 permitted the court to consider an appeal from the trial court's decision to revoke and adjudicate, the court lacked jurisdiction over defendant's sufficiency claim under Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(b)(3). The court held that was so because there was no jurisdictional defect, the substance of the appeal was not raised by written motion and ruled on before trial, and the trial court did not grant permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>

Appellant county appraisal officials challenged that decision. The court affirmed the designation for three of the years complained of because appellee had exhausted its administrative remedies, but reversed for the other three years because appellee did not exhaust its remedies for those years. Appellee had not filed an application for open-space designation or a protest for three of the years; thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine the designation for those years.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(1994). Appellant challenged his conviction and the court affirmed.

Appellant also argued that the trial court improperly admitted a photograph of the victim into evidence. The court held that &sect; 19.02 did not lessen appellee's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crime, and therefore it did not violate appellant's constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant juvenile sought review from the 338th District Court, Harris County (Texas) for a conviction of capital murder based upon claims that defendant's written confession was inadmissible, the evidence was insufficient to prove an intent to rob the victim, a jury charge was erroneous, weapons were illegally seized, and Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant juvenile was convicted of capital murder for killing victim during a robbery. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. A challenge to the voluntariness of defendant's confession was not preserved; therefore, it was not reviewable. Tex. R. App. P. 52(a). Defendant's signing a confession in the presence of a magistrate, in the magistrate's office, and without the police, met the requirements of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09(b)(1)(G) (1996) and Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 52.02(a), 52.025 (1996). The evidence legally and factually supported the conviction because the use of a deadly weapon inferred that defendant intended to kill the victim, and co-conspirator's testimony corroborated defendant's confession that killing occurred during a robbery. The jury was properly not charged on voluntariness under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.01(a) (1994), where it was not raised by evidence. Defendant disavowed any property or possessory interest in a vehicle or weapons seized after a search and, thus, had no expectation of privacy protected by the U.S. Const. amend IV. The Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Texas constitutions were not violated by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant juvenile's capital murder conviction was affirmed because statutory requirements for obtaining a confession were met, and evidence was sufficient to support an inference that defendant intended to kill the victim during robbery. Also, defendant had no Fourth Amendment right to privacy in a vehicle and weapons, and the Equal Protection Clause was not violated when defendant was tried as an adult and sentenced to life in prison.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant defendant sought review of his conviction from the 252nd District Court, Jefferson County (Texas), for sexual assault, after the trial court used improper language in a jury instruction during the punishment phase of his trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant defendant was convicted of sexual assault and sought review of his conviction on the ground that the trial court gave an incorrect jury instruction at the punishment stage of the trial. The court found that pursuant to Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a), and Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 37.07(4) (1993), the trial court was permitted to include instructions on the effects of parole laws in the jury charge. However, the trial court erred in using the phrase &quot;sentence imposed&quot; instead of the statutorily mandated phrase &quot;period of incarceration.&quot; Since appellant did not object to this error at trial, his conviction could only be reversed if the error caused egregious harm. The court affirmed the conviction because it found no egregious harm due. The error was mitigated by the fact that there were other instructions given to the jury that clarified the parole laws, the appellant did not receive a maximum sentence, and there were no improper comments from counsel for appellee prosecution regarding parole laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant defendant's conviction for sexual assault from the trial court was affirmed because, even though the jury charge contained an improper instruction, there was no egregious harm to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;481.117 (1992), in connection with his possession of a scheduled drug prescribed by a foreign physician.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Texas resident was examined by a physician in Mexico and received a prescription for Valium. Appellant appropriately claimed the prescription drugs when he cleared customs in Laredo, Texas. Subsequently, appellant was arrested for felony possession of a controlled substance in violation of the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;481.117 (1992) (Act), when the prescription drugs were discovered by a police officer. The Act expressly stated that possession of a controlled substance prescribed by a foreign physician was a criminal offense. The court held that the Act was not constitutionally vague because it provided fair warning to an individual of ordinary intelligence of the conduct it proscribed. However, the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect;844, provided that an individual was in lawful possession of a controlled substance if it was obtained pursuant to a valid prescription from a practitioner while acting in the course of professional practice. Therefore, the trial court's judgment was reversed because appellant was in lawful possession of a controlled substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C.S. &sect;844 which preempted the Texas statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled nolo contendere to, and was convicted on, a charge of felony criminal mischief.

The trial court heard the motion on appellant's plea of not true, and the state presented written reports, without objection, showing that he was a discipline problem and failed to cooperate in the substance abuse treatment program. The court affirmed and rejected his first point, finding that the trial court had sufficient authority to revoke his probation because he had an adversarial hearing prior to the revocation and the statute was constitutional. Further, the trial court properly heard his testimony and it had specifically found and recited into the record that appellant was competent to stand trial at the time of the revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court also overruled appellant's objection regarding notice of the deed restrictions, holding that appellant had construction notice, by virtue of owning the property.
