Appellant sought review of his conviction and sentence on multiple grounds. The court affirmed. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish that appellant specifically intended to kill the victim. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it disqualified jurors because jurors' views toward the death penalty would have substantially impaired or prevented them from performing their duties. The trial court did not err when it required appellant to wear glasses found at the crime scene because the display was not excessively suggestive and prejudicial. The trial court did not err when it refused to admit appellant's post-arrest statement because admission of statements made at the time of arrest to support appellant's version of the facts was clearly offensive to the hearsay rule. Admission of a photograph was not error because the photograph was relevant and non-inflammatory. Finally, the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate when compared to similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which found him guilty, after a jury trial, of robbery and of murder of the first degree, for which he was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a death sentence after being convicted of first-degree murder. The court affirmed. It rejected a claim that police had no right under the Statewide Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act (SMPJA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8953, to search and seize inculpating items in another jurisdiction, holding that SMPJA neither prohibited the conduct nor required suppression of the evidence. The homeowners had authorized the search, rendering it legal. The court upheld lower court rulings concerning the admission of photographs. The court rejected claims as to defendant's nonuse of certain mitigation evidence, upholding a lower court ruling that if defendant offered evidence that he had foiled a death plot against a detective, the jury would be permitted to hear that defendant tried to use his role to obtain leniency. The court also held that information relating to the death plot was not Brady material; that the trial judge, a former prosecutor, did not have to recuse himself; that the jury instructions were proper; and that the use of a death sentence for felony murder was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence because the lower court corrected refused to suppress evidence obtained without a warrant in a foreign jurisdiction; did not abuse its discretion in admitting certain photographs; correctly ruled concerning the scope of testimony on certain mitigating circumstances; and had not erred in denying defendant's recusal motion, based on the trial judge's prior employment as a prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state ethics commission sought review of a decision of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which stayed a subpoena served on the bank of appellee councilman and denied appellee council members' request to enjoin appellant from continuing to investigate appellees. Appellant contended that the stay of the subpoena effectively granted a preliminary injunction of its investigation. Appellees filed an application to quash the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state ethics commission began an investigation of appellee council members and issued a subpoena to a bank where one of the appellees had accounts. Appellees' request for injunctive relief was denied, but their motion to stay the subpoena was granted. The court granted appellees' motion to quash an appeal from the stay order. The court found that during the period of time appellant was investigating appellees and issuing the subpoena, it was a legal non-entity, and any action taken by it was null and void. Legislative resolutions that extended the effective date of appellant's authority pursuant to the Sunset Act, 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1795.1-1795.14, were also held to be null and void and without legal effect. 71 P.S. &sect; 1795.4(4) was held to be an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power under Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 because it did not merely delegate the power to administer a procedural mechanism of the Sunset Act but delegated complete control to six designated members of the general assembly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee council members' application to quash the appeal of appellant state ethics commission was granted on the ground that appellant ceased to exist by operation of statute following a wind-up period and was a legal non-entity during the time of its investigation of appellees and the issuance of a subpoena.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving improper disposal of solid waste, appellant disposal service challenged an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which reversed and remanded the lower court's order suppressing testimony grounded on information obtained without a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant disposal service, convicted of a summary offense for operating a transfer station without a permit, challenged the constitutionality of the warrantless inspection provisions of &sect; 608 of the Solid Waste Management Act (act), 35 P.S. &sect; 6018.608. The trial court's suppression order, entered on reconsideration, was reversed. On further appeal, the issue was whether suppression of the evidence was required when the inspector entered private property, not visible from the public road, and searched an enclosed area without first obtaining a search warrant. The court determined that the warrantless search provisions of the act were valid under the administrative search exception to the warrant requirement of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court found that anyone involved in a business engaged in the disposal of solid waste was expected to be aware that, because of the vital public and statutory interest that society had in proper solid waste disposal from an environmental standpoint, unannounced inspections could be anticipated. Additionally, this result was required by Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the reversal of the suppression order because the risks solid waste posed to the public, coupled with appellant disposal service's knowledge of those risks, justified the warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

The information was provided by the carrier to the commonwealth under 40 P.S. &sect; 1610.3 of the Arson Reporting Immunity Act, and when defendants were charged with arson they sought and obtained the suppression of the aforesaid evidence on the basis that the waiver of their rights under U.S. Const. amend. V, was economically coerced by the insurer under the implied threat that they would forfeit their right to payment under the policy for failure to cooperate with the investigation. The superior court affirmed the suppression order and the commonwealth appealed. The court reversed the order and remanded the cause for further proceedings, finding that defendants were emphatically advised that the investigation information would be divulged to anyone with proper authority and that no discussion was had concerning defendants' rights against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court also upheld the admissibility of a pre-death photo of the victim and several post-mortem photos. The court determined that defendant was not entitled to a mistrial on the basis of certain comments made by the prosecutor.

PUC had determined that the various outages for which appellee sought cost recovery were its own fault and the result of mismanagement.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 1301. Appellants sought review of the reversal and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that PUC had correctly applied an ordinary negligence standard in determining whether appellee was at fault for the outages and that the term &quot;heightened standard of care&quot; was simply a mis-naming of the principle applied. The court found that the only portion of PUC's determination that was not supported by substantial evidence was its refusal to allow cost recovery for an unforeseeable gasket leak.</SPAN></P>

Appellants then challenged the reversal, and the court reversed, reinstating the suppression order. The court held that probable cause was required to place a pen register on a telephone line under the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State Employee's Retirement Board, challenged the judgment of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which entered summary judgment in favor of appellees, judges who took office after March 1, 1974, and the Pennsylvania Conference of Trial Judges. Appellees prevailed on their argument that they were entitled to the same range of retirement benefit packages as were available to judges who entered service before that date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted a statute that eliminated a retirement benefit package that was available to judges who took office prior to March 1, 1974. Appellees, judges who took office after March 1, 1974, and the Pennsylvania Conference of Trial Judges, filed an action that challenged the law. The trial court entered summary judgment in appellee's favor. Appellant, the State Employer's Retirement Board, challenged the judgment and the court affirmed. The court ruled that it had inherent power to require payment of those sums necessary to carry out the court system's mandated functions. The court ruled that the retirement package was part of a judge's overall compensation. The court reviewed issues of inflation and the discrepancy between what state court and federal court judges were paid. The court stressed the need for qualified judges. The court ruled that there was no basis that justified treating the judges who took office after March 1, 1974, differently from those who assumed office prior to that date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judge sought review of the judgment of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order of the State Employees' Retirement Board denying his request for reinstatement to class E-1 contributor status under the State Employees' Retirement Code of 1959, 71 P. S. &sect;&sect; 1725-101, 1725-809.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judge sought reinstatement to the retirement status he held during a prior term as judge. The State Employees' Retirement Board denied his request for reinstatement, and the trial court affirmed. Appellant challenged the judgment, contending that the board's refusal to allow him to reenter the retirement system at his prior contributor status was an unconstitutional impairment of his contractual rights. The court agreed with appellant's contention, finding that the legislature was not authorized to compensate judges of the same class/level of court who perform the same functions at different rates of compensation based solely on the dates on which the judges began their respective terms of office. The court ruled that the two-tier retirement compensation system was at-odds with a unified judicial system because the classifications created a disparity in deferred compensation benefits. The court ruled that the system violated equal protection provisions of the state constitution because there was no rational basis for the system since financial expediency was not a sufficient justification. Accordingly, the court reversed the holding of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellants' contentions, finding that the aged were not entitled to special judicial protection because there was no basis to justify heightened scrutiny of the retirement provision. The court ruled that the rational basis test was the appropriate standard concerning classifications based on age because old age was not a discrete and insular group that required extraordinary protection. The court noted that old age marked a stage of life each person reached if they lived out a normal span.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree in connection with the contract murder of his wife.

A warrant for his execution was then issued by the governor, following which appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The petition and request for a stay of execution were denied by the lower court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order from the Superior Court, affirming the judgment of Sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania) finding defendant guilty of murder in the third degree and endangering the welfare of a child. The court granted allocatur to consider the constitutionality of the insanity statute,&nbsp;Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 315.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murder in connection with the death of her newborn child. On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of the state insanity statute,&nbsp;Pa. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 315, which placed the burden of proving insanity upon the criminal defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant contended that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 315 violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, which assures all persons due process of law. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that there was more than sufficient evidence that defendant beat her newborn child to death. With regard to the evidence defendant presented in support of her insanity defense, the court believed a factfinder could reasonably conclude that defendant failed to meet her burden of proof. Neither expert presented by the defense testified that defendant was acting pursuant to a mental defect at the time of the killing; instead, each admitted that defendant's psychosis did not develop until after the homicide. Thus the court as finder of fact could reject the conclusion reached by the psychiatrists that defendant did not know the nature and quality of wrongfulness of her act because of a mental defect.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that it found no constitutional defect in the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 et seq.

The court affirmed both convictions and the death sentence. The court held that although the trial court erred in allowing a state trooper to testify when he was not properly qualified as an expert witness, it was harmless error. The noted that there was uncontradicted evidence establishing defendant's intent to kill the victim. Also, the audible scream and crying by murder victim's mother, during prosecutor's opening argument recital of number of times victim had been stabbed, did not require mistrial where trial judge gave general cautionary instruction to jury and, after polling them individually in chambers, determined that they had been unswayed.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, appellees sought review in the courts, and the trial court reversed. On review, appellant contended the trial court erred in finding that the Act was inapplicable to publicly employed attorneys. The appeals court reversed the trial court order and reinstated appellant's opinions. The court ruled that publicly employed attorneys were subject to the reasonable regulation of their governmental employer as long as it did not conflict with the authority of the state Supreme Court in regulating attorney conduct. Because the financial disclosure requirement imposed by the Act was not incompatible with any of the rules applicable to attorneys in the Commonwealth, it was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed suit against appellee state, treasurer, and secretary of education for declaratory and equitable relief seeking to have the statutory scheme for the funding of Commonwealth public schools declared unconstitutional. Appellants later filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. There were no supporting affidavits or depositions filed with the motion, except for an affidavit from appellants' counsel in which he made various allegations of proof but offered no concrete support. Appellees resisted appellants' motion, but did not file their own motion. Nevertheless, the trial court denied appellants' motion, and then entered summary judgment for appellees. On review, appellants argued that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of a non-moving party. The appeals court reversed and remanded. The court reasoned that Pa. R. Civ. P. 1035 did not contain any provision allowing a trial court to grant summary judgment in favor of a non-moving party. The court noted that in a motion for summary judgment only the moving party can prevail, because if he fails, a dispute continues on the facts themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a hotel owner, appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which upheld the constitutionality of the Convention Center Authority Act of 1986, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16201, et seq., under both the Pennsylvania and the United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Convention Center Authority Act (Act), 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16201, et seq., a city council enacted a hotel room rental tax (tax). The tax required all hotel operators to collect the tax from its patrons and pay the tax to the city. The tax was earmarked for convention center purposes. Plaintiff, a hotel owner in the city, challenged the tax. The court affirmed the decision upholding the constitutionality of the Act and the tax. The tax and Act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution and did not violate the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution because the benefit received and the burden imposed were proportionate. Plaintiff failed to show that the tax or convention center would hurt its hotel business. Plaintiff could not say that its business was hurt. Nor could plaintiff support its claim that it would not benefit from the convention center. In fact, evidence showed that hotels were likely to profit from the convention center. The Act did not violate the Special Law Clause, Pa. Const. art. 3, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed his sentence for robbery, theft, receiving stolen property, assault, reckless endangerment, and carrying a firearm without a license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery, theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, possessing an instrument of crime, and carrying a firearm without a license in violation of 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mental patient challenged the order from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which refused the exclude a reporter from appellee newspaper from an informal conference conducted pursuant to 50 P.S. &sect; 7303 of the Mental Health Procedures Act. The trial court also applied 50 P.S. &sect; 7304(e)(4) and found the conference to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mental patient was accused of shooting several persons. A petition for involuntary treatment was filed pursuant to 50 P.S. &sect; 7303 of the Mental Health Procedures Act. At the hearing to determine whether appellant should be confined pursuant to that section, appellant sought a private hearing pursuant to 50 P.S. &sect; 7304(e)(4). Appellee newspaper's reporter objected. The trial court agreed to keep the hearing public but found that section 7304(e)(4) was unconstitutional, and committed appellant. The two statutory sections covered different proceedings. Section 7303 hearings were for a 20-day commitment and were fairly informal. Section &sect; 7304(e)(4) covered a 90-day commitment and required greater formality. The hearing below was a section 7303 hearing and section 7304(e)(4) had no applicability. Appellant was not subjected to the deprivation of a constitutional right to a private hearing. No information was released at the hearing that was of a confidential nature. The appellate court affirmed the opening of the hearing to the public but rejected the conclusion that section 7304(e)(4) was unconstitutional or applied to a section 7303 hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order that a hearing concerning the involuntary commitment of appellant mental patient would remain public following appellee newspaper's objection to a private hearing was affirmed. There was nothing of a confidential nature revealed at the hearing that would have triggered a privacy right but the trial court's application of a separate statute covering 90-day commitments and its finding that that statute was unconstitutional was in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of the offenses of murder of the first degree, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. Defendant sought review of the trial court judgments, arguing numerous errors, including that the Commonwealth was precluded from prosecuting him for the victim's death due to a previous acquittal on charges of possessing the murder weapon. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial court. It held that defendant's previous acquittal on charges of possessing a firearm in violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6106, 6108, did not necessarily litigate or decide an issue dispositive of, or sufficiently similar to, the issues involved in the current prosecution to preclude the Commonwealth from prosecuting defendant. The court held that defendant's acquittal of violating &sect; 6106 might well have been based upon the Commonwealth's failure to demonstrate that he had no license for the firearm or to convince the fact-finder that he had it concealed on his person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees sought to recover damages from appellees employers based on the Uninsured Motorist Act, 40 P.S. &sect; 2000, resulting from personal injuries sustained in work-related automobile accidents with uninsured drivers. The lower court found in favor of appellees because they were immunized from appellants' claims for uninsured motorist benefits under the Workmen's' Compensation Act. 77 P.S. &sect; 1 et seq. On appeal, the court found that the Uninsured Motorist Act required that automobile insurance policies covering personal-injury liability also provide protection against uninsured motorists. However, the court also found that the availability of this protection to employees of the owner of the insured vehicle implicated the Workmen's Compensation Act, which stated that it is the exclusive source of an employer's liability to an employee for work-related injury. The court held that the dual capacity exception, in which an employer could have a dual capacity with respect to its employee in such circumstances in which the employer's relationship to the injury went beyond that of mere employer, did not apply. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;341 Pa. Super. 183, 491 A.2d 212 (1983)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Accordingly, the Appellee's conviction in the instant case may be sustained only if the Commonwealth's evidence established that he acted recklessly, or criminally negligently. The Commonwealth has not attempted to argue that the conviction should be upheld because the evidence was sufficient to establish even criminal negligence, the minimal level of culpability required. Indeed, it could not do so based upon this record. The order of the Superior Court reversing the judgment of sentence and discharging the Appellee is affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, reversing the trial court's judgment that entered defendant's conviction for vehicular homicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to properly yield when making a left turn, in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3322, and the other driver died as a result of the collision. Defendant was convicted of homicide by vehicle, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. 3732, and sentenced to a one-year probation and a fine. On appeal, the superior court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, but reversed the conviction, reasoning that it deprived defendant of his U.S. Const. amend. IV due process rights by imposing criminal liability upon a showing of ordinary negligence. On appeal, the court rejected the superior court's analysis of the due process issue, but affirmed the superior court order reversing the conviction, on other grounds. The court held that ordinary negligence would not sustain a conviction for the offense of homicide by vehicle. The phrase &quot;negligently&quot; in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 302(b)(4) applied and meant criminal negligence and did not encompass the tort liability concept of negligence. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the superior court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the superior court that found that reversed the judgment of the trial court and discharged defendant. The court held that although the superior court's analysis regarding the constitutionality of the vehicular homicide statute was incorrect, the evidence only showed ordinary negligence, and this could not support the conviction under the proper interpretation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Both the lower trial court and the trial court affirmed. The appellate court affirmed. Permission to operate a vehicle was subject to certain conditions, including the implied consent to an alcohol test under Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(a). Seventy-five Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(b) clearly stated that a license could be submitted for failure to submit to the test. Whether the roadblock was unconstitutional was not an issue because the suspension was for the refusal to take the test, not because appellant was arrested for driving while intoxicated. The legality of the arrest was immaterial. Seventy-five Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which reversed a judgment of sentence for statutory rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure, and corruption of a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prosecution for statutory rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure, and corruption of a minor, defendant was convicted and a judgment of sentence was entered against him. The superior court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded for resentencing on the ground that the state commission on sentencing exceeded its statutory grant of authority by adopting guidelines that increased the severity of sentences on the basis of prior conviction misdemeanors that did not involve deadly weapons. On review the court agreed with the prosecution that the legislation insisted that the commission treat a person with prior weapons misdemeanors more severely, but left it to the commission, in the extent of its broad grant of general authority, to determine what other conditions, including non-weapons misdemeanors, might have also justified increased severity. The court held that, whether 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2154 was strictly or liberally construed, it in no way followed that the mandatory term that &quot;shall&quot; was also an exclusive. Accordingly, the order of the superior court was vacated and the judgment of sentence was reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the superior court's order and the judgment of sentence was reinstated because the state commission on sentencing had broad discretion in determining what conditions would warrant a more severe sentence with respect to defendant's convictions for statutory rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure, and corruption of a minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare challenged the decision from the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear appellee class' action under 42 U.S.C.S. 1983. Appellant contended that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 761(a)(1)(v) did not preclude the trial court from asserting jurisdiction over appellee's action for injunctive and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee class brought an action on behalf of county residents who had participated in the Community Work Experience Program (CWEP). Three of appellee's four claims were brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Appellees and appellant Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court held that, since the action was largely based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, it lacked original jurisdiction to hear the case and vacated its order to certify the class. Appellant was permitted to seek immediate review of the interlocutory transfer order. Both parties contended that the case should remain with the trial court. The court held that, as long as appellant secretary was a party to the suit, the trial court would normally have jurisdiction under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 761(a). The trial court found that the &sect; 1983 actions were in the nature of a trespass, therefore falling under the exception of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 761(a)(1)(v). However, the court held that appellee's action was for injunctive and declaratory relief, which excluded it from &sect; 761(A)(1)(v).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant contended that the method by which the sentencing guidelines, 204 Pa.

The court determined that the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing was not an administrative agency, that is, an agency charged with administering the laws. The court also found that the commission's guidelines could not, without more, be given the effect of law, either as legislation or regulation, so as to by themselves alter the legal rights and duties of the defendant, the prosecutor, and the sentencing court. The court held that because the guidelines were not adopted according to the proper scheme, however, but were the product of a rejection resolution that was not presented to the governor in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 9, they had to be declared to be of no force at all. Accordingly, the court vacated appellant's sentence and remanded for resentencing pursuant to the remaining valid provisions of the sentencing code.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held unconstitutional a legislative attempt to give retroactive effect to an amendment to the disclosure provisions in the Loan Law, 41 P.S. &sect; 101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee bank filed suit against appellant guarantors, seeking payment on the agreement of guarantee of a business loan they both signed. Appellants disputed liability and argued that appellee did not comply with the disclosure laws on loans secured by residential real estate, 41 P.S. &sect; 401 (1986). Specifically, appellants cited appellee's failure to inform them that they could lose their home if they did not repay the loan. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment and held that the legislature's attempt to apply the disclosure requirements retroactively to a business loan secured by residential real estate violated the contracts clauses of Pennsylvania and United States constitutions, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. On appeal, the court held that, if applied to this transaction, the amendment to the law would void the agreement of guarantee and change the intention of the parties and the bargained-for consideration. Because this would violate the contract clause, it was unconstitutional. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellee argued that as the successful bidder at the tax sale, he had an ownership interest, to wit equitable title, and, thus, had a legally protected property interest which entitled him to actual notice of condemnation and demolition. The court agreed, holding that appellee was the equitable owner of the property. The court evaluated appellant's notification efforts and found them insufficient. Appellee was required to expend reasonable efforts to ascertain the identity of the purchaser of the property at the tax sale. The record demonstrated clearly that the office of the city treasurer maintained a list of all properties sold at tax sales and actually forwarded a list of properties sold to the agency responsible for condemnation.

Petitioner held that such failure resulted in violations of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3302, Model Code of Judicial Conduct Canons 1 and 2, and Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 17(b). Respondents argued that ordered financial disclosures violated their Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, rights against self-incrimination. The court adopted petitioner's recommendation. The Fifth Amendment privilege was not an acceptable answer to any question on the Statement of Financial Interest required by Order No. 47. Order No. 47 was designed to preserve the integrity and impartiality of the judicial system. Requiring disclosure of certain valuable gifts was designed to assure citizens of the impartiality and honesty of public officials and to promote public confidence. Further, removal of respondents from office after they invoked the privilege against self-incrimination did not amount to an inference that respondents were guilty of receiving improper gifts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellee crime victims' negligence action, appellant city sought review of an order of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which reversed an order of the trial court granting appellant a judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee crime victims were injured by an intruder who had escaped from appellant city's detention center for juvenile criminal offenders. Appellees alleged that appellant negligently maintained the real estate, thereby facilitating the escape. The trial court granted appellant judgment on the pleadings but the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that appellees' complaint stated a cause of action against appellant under an exception to governmental immunity covering the care, custody, and control of real estate by a local agency. The Supreme Court held that as a precondition to maintaining an action against appellant, appellees had to satisfy the three statutory requirements and found that appellees stated a cause of action which could be maintained at common law against one not having an immunity defense, and thus satisfied the first requirement. The court further held that appellant's negligence was sufficiently implicated in appellees' injuries so as to meet the second requirement. The court finally held, however, that appellees had not met the third requirement and that appellant was not liable for the criminal acts of others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstated the trial court's order on the basis that appellant city could not be held liable for the acts of criminals who took advantage of defects in municipal property to commit their own crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of transportation filed a declaration of the taking of appellees landowners' property. Estimated just compensation was offered to each appellee. After the condemnation appellees were unable to make use of their land. The trial court awarded compensation and ordered appellant to pay delay damages. In post-trial motions, appellant asserted 26 Pa. Stat. &sect; 1-611. The trial court determined that such statute was unconstitutional because it did not provide compensation for the diminished use of appellees' land. The court held that 26 Pa. Stat. &sect; 611 did pass constitutional muster in determining when delay damages go into effect. The record established that appellant's declaration of taking, in conjunction with its subsequent actions, infringed on landowner's full and normal use of their property, and that delay damages were properly awarded. Furthermore, the trial court acted appropriately in refusing to impose a six percent interest rate, and choosing instead the prevailing commercial loan rate. Accordingly, the court reversed the lower court's decision in part and affirmed part of its decision.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 722(4), defendant sought review of the judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania) after a jury found defendant guilty of murder in the first degree and possession of an instrument of crime and determined that the death penalty was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of murder in the first degree and possession of an instrument of crime. The jury also decided that imposition of the death sentence was appropriate, having found the aggravating circumstance of torture. The trial court formally imposed the death sentence. The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, as defendant admitted to several people that he killed his wife, he confessed to the killing after being advised of his rights, and the circumstances of the crime established that he acted with the specific intent to kill. The court also found that the trial court did not prejudice defendant by refusing to grant defense counsel a recess prior to calling defendant to the stand. Further, the court found that defendant failed to establish that counsel was ineffective prior to trial or during the guilt stage. The court vacated the death sentence, holding that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's jury instruction on the aggravating circumstance of torture because the instruction failed to provide any definition of the term torture and was therefore prejudicially deficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the judgment of sentence entered by the trial court because the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime and counsel was not ineffective prior to or at trial. The court reversed the sentence of death and remanded to the trial court for imposition of a life sentence because counsel was ineffective during the punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee operated a bar under a liquor license issued by appellee liquor control commission. The local electorate voted the area in which the bar was located dry, pursuant to the local option provision of 47 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4-472, and appellant was unable to renew his license. Appellant brought suit against appellee to have &sect; 4-472 declared violative of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. The lower court dismissed appellant's suit, and appellant sought review of the decision. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court stated that neither appellant nor anyone else had any property interest in the right to sell liquor, and that a vote to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within a locality was not a taking of private property for public use requiring compensation to those who were unable to renew a license. The court held that the local option law was not violative of due process because it was a reasonable exercise of police powers and was rationally related to the object and purposes of the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of two counts of murder of the first degree and two counts of kidnapping. A separate sentencing hearing was held, as required by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9711, and defendant was sentenced to death in connection with the two murder convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of murder of the first degree and two counts of kidnapping. He was sentenced to death for the murders. Defendant, 15 years old, fatally shot two younger children with a shotgun, after having taken them to a vacant house owned by defendant's family. On appeal, the court affirmed the murder convictions, but vacated the death sentence and reversed the kidnapping convictions. The evidence of defendant's guilt as to murder of the first degree was so strong as to leave no question that defendant's guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury found that kidnapping was an aggravating circumstance justifying imposition of the death penalty. However, the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict of guilt as to kidnapping; thus, one of the statutory aggravating circumstances found by the jury was without proper basis. There was no proof that the victims were confined or removed a substantial distance from their original location. There was no proof that any movement of the children was accomplished by force, threat, deception, or without parental consent.</SPAN></P>

The convictions as to the two counts of kidnapping were reversed. The jury relied on the aggravating circumstance of kidnapping to impose the death sentence; however, the elements of the crime of kidnapping were not established beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was incarcerated and filed a pro se Post Conviction Hearing Act petition attacking his conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee pleaded guilty to driving an overweight truck. The district justice imposed the fine mandated by statute and the matter was appealed where appellee again pleaded guilty. In spite of the mandatory nature of the sentencing statute, however, appellee's fine was substantially reduced. Commonwealth appealed. On review, the court held that mandatory sentences based upon statutory classifications were constitutional if they conformed to the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court stated that the classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some rational difference having a fair, substantial and reasonable relationship to the objective or objectives of the legislation at issue so that all persons similarly situated will be treated alike. Applying the rational basis test the court held it was apparent that the legislative scheme or classification whereby overweight fines could not have been reduced or forgiven because of inability to pay was not arbitrary and bore a perfectly rational relationship to a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>

The original conviction was vacated and remanded for a new trial after the jury was permitted to have a copy of appellant's written confession during deliberations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The conviction was vacated and the cause was remanded for a new trial because the jury was permitted to have a copy of appellant's written confession during deliberations. During the second trial, appellant requested the judge instruct the jury that it could find appellant guilty of third degree murder or voluntary manslaughter as well as first degree murder. The judge refused to give the instruction based on a recent holding by the court stating that a jury verdict of not guilty of lesser included homicides along with a guilty verdict on murder precluded re-trial on the lesser included homicides if the murder conviction was vacated. Upon review, the court held that such an instruction was required only when the evidence permitted a jury to determine the lesser included offenses were the offenses actually committed. Appellant did not meet his burden of producing evidence which required the instruction nor was there any other evidence of the lesser included offenses. The court held that if there was an error in failing to charge the jury on lesser included offenses, it was harmless and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Revenue determined that appellee corporation was subject to a franchise tax under 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7601. The Board of Finance and Revenue affirmed this determination. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed because it determined that appellee's activities consisted solely of soliciting orders for its products and, thus, fell short of &quot;doing business&quot;. Appellant contended that the lower court erred in its holding that mere solicitation did not constitute doing business for the purposes of 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7601. Appellee employed a vast network of representatives, whose primary functions were to drum up business. The court determined that it was not incorrect for the Board of Finance and Review to conclude that appellee was doing business for purposes of the franchise tax. Appellee alleged that the statute was unconstitutional due to an insufficient nexus between appellee and state to justify exercise of the taxing power. The court found this argument to be without merit. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the Commonwealth Court, and reinstated the decision of the Board of Finance and Review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted appellee in a bench trial of voluntary manslaughter, and thereafter found 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and the trial court thereafter found a provision of the Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa.

Appellant commonwealth sought appellate review of the action of the sentencing court. The court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under &sect; 9712(d) and 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 722(7). Section 9712 required the imposition of a minimum prison sentence of at least five years upon conviction of certain enumerated felonies, where it was proven at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence that appellee visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for resentencing, because &sect; 9712(d) was both applicable to the facts surrounding appellee's conviction and constitutional in general. The court held that &sect; 9712(d) was clear and unambiguous, and accordingly applied its plain meaning and common usage to determine that it did not implicate appellee's fundamental liberty interest, because his fundamental right to freedom from confinement was already forfeited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) after being convicted of murder of the first degree, rape, burglary, and possession of an instrument of crime and was assessed a penalty of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was convicted of murder of the first degree, rape, burglary, and possession of an instrument of crime in connection with the violent death of a 12 year old girl, the jury imposed a sentence of death. Upon review, appellant argued the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of murder of the first degree, that the suppression court committed error in denying his motion to suppress his confession, that he should have been granted a mistrial as a result of prosecutorial misconduct, and that the death penalty was unconstitutional. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction of murder and that the waiver of appellant's constitutional rights was knowing and intelligent. The suppression court found the evidence introduced by the prosecution more credible than that of appellant, and thus refused to grant the motion to suppress. Moreover, appellant's improper response to a prosecutor's question on cross-examination was unsolicited and promptly stricken from the record. Lastly, in affirming the conviction and sentence, appellant's contention that the death penalty statute was vague and overbroad was dismissed as meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed on appellant by the trial court because the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, alleged prejudicial statements made by appellant on cross-examination were unsolicited, appellant's confession was knowing and intelligent, and there was sufficient aggravating circumstances, including appellant's history of violence, to support he imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was charged with violating &sect; 610(7) of the Solid Waste Management Act (Act), 35 P.S. &sect; 6018.610(7), obstructing a Department employee, and obstruction of justice, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5101. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the charges, contending that the warrantless search provision of the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and dismissed the charges. The court affirmed, holding that U.S. Const. amend IV prohibited the Department from conducting random, warrantless searches of commercial property under the Act in order to enforce ordinary solid waste regulations because such waste did not pose the same danger to public health as hazardous waste, for which such searches were permissible, and the solid waste industry lacked the special characteristics that would ordinarily put an operator on notice of the potential for random regulatory searches.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney general sought relief from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed charges against appellees, individual and corporation, for dumping or permitting the dumping of hazardous wastes without a permit and for illegally transporting solid wastes to a facility. The trial court found the underlying statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, individual and corporation, were charged with violations of the Solid Waste Management Act, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6018.101-6018.1003. The trial court dismissed the charges on constitutional grounds. The court reversed, holding that, although two provisions of the act proscribed identical conduct yet provided for vastly different penalties, it did not carve out classifications or single out any distinct class of persons for unequal treatment, but by its terms applies equally to all. The court held that the act did not confer upon the prosecutor discretion other than that already routinely exercised in the enforcement of other statutes imposing criminal sanctions, and did not violate equal protection principles. The court held that the decision of whether to prosecute an alleged offender was a matter legitimately committed to the sound discretion of the prosecutor or agency charged with enforcement of the act, that the act provided clear notice to all as to the conduct proscribed and the possible penalties for its violation, and that it did not offend due process. The court held that the act did not improperly delegate legislative powers to prosecutors.</SPAN></P>

The court further directed that the mandatory provisions of R. 238, which assess delay damages against defendants without regard to fault, were suspended for all cases pending in the courts and for any cases instituted thereafter because R. 238 had become an uncontestable presumption that all fault lies with a defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant murderer was convicted of first degree murder based upon the facts that appellant escaped from prison, ambushed the decedent, and stole money, a car, clothing, and the weapon used to kill the decedent. Pursuant to the automatic direct review by the court, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 722(4), 9711(h)(1), the conviction was affirmed. The consolidation of the escape charge with other charges was proper pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 1127(A)(1)(b), because the murder, robbery, and burglary were perpetrated in continuance of appellant's escape and therefore part of the same transaction. The prosecution's use of peremptory challenges to eliminate prospective jurors that wavered on the question of the death penalty did not violate appellant's right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, under the U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV. Potential jurors that opposed the death penalty were not a distinctive group, and therefore, much less so were venire persons who wavered on their response to their ability to impose the death sentence. Similarly, the court rejected the notion that by excluding such jurors, the impaneled jury was biased in favor of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the first degree murder conviction and sentence to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (Pennsylvania), which quashed an information that charged defendant with the offense of homicide by vehicle. The court found 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to traffic light violations because defendant could not have known that death would be a probable consequence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly ran a red light causing a fatal automobile accident. He was charged with the offense of homicide by vehicle, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732, but the information was quashed on the trial court's reasoning that a traffic light violation could not be the basis for a homicide charge. Because the decision rested on constitutional grounds of equal protection, review was transferred to the supreme court. The court noted that traffic light violations were no less likely to result in fatalities than were many other offenses that involved a potential for violent collisions. On the issue of equal protection, the court rejected defendant's argument that statutory scheme &sect; 3732 impermissibly created differences in criminal liability among persons who unintentionally caused fatalities and that those differences rested upon the arbitrary factor of whether the person causing any given fatality was a motorist. The court found that the two classes of offenders were not similarly situated. Reversing the order that quashed the information, the court held that there was a rational basis for the difference in penalties imposed for involuntary manslaughter and homicide by vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that quashed the information charging defendant with the offense of homicide by vehicle. The court rejected the equal protection attack on applying a homicide statute against defendant for running a red light because the commonwealth had a legitimate interest in reducing highway fatalities and persons guilty of involuntary manslaughter were not similarly situated to require the same punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal was sentenced to death after a jury convicted appellant of robbery, possession of an instrument of crime-generally, and two counts of murder in the first degree for the shooting deaths of two persons.

The court held that appellant did not establish the prerequisites necessary to invoke automatic standing to contest the search and seizure of evidence from the residence of appellant's acquaintance. The court held that the two veniremen were properly excluded because the veniremen expressed their inability to follow the instructions of the court. The court held that the lower court erred in admitting hearsay testimony, but the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected appellant's ineffectiveness of counsel arguments, holding that appellant's arguments failed to overcome the initial threshold inquiry, because the underlying claims lacked merit. Further, the court held that the death sentence imposed by the jury was neither excessive nor disproportionate to penalties imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the gasoline can from the trunk of appellant's vehicle was properly admissible because appellant consented to its seizure.

The intermediate appellate court affirmed the findings that marker fee and the axle tax were unconstitutional in two actions based on the interstate commerce clause, and granted appellant's preliminary objections in the third case, holding that it lacked jurisdiction for appellees' failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court reversed the first orders, holding that the marker fee was not discriminatory, and the axle tax was not excessive or unrelated to the services provided by appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant New Jersey resident conducted his medical practice from an office in Pennsylvania. Based on the Reciprocal Personal Income Tax Agreement between Pennsylvania and New Jersey, appellant argued that as a non-resident he was exempt from personal income tax. The commonwealth court affirmed the decision of the Board of Finance and Revenue assessing a tax deficiency. On review, the court noted that although the agreement exempted residents of one state who worked in the other from filing returns and paying personal income taxes, the exemption only applied to income in the form of compensation. Because appellant's entire income earned in Pennsylvania was net profits from his practice, the court held that he was not entitled to the exemption. The court rejected appellant's equal protection attack on the agreement finding that appellant did little to demonstrate that the taxing scheme was unreasonable. The court found that a worker who could not chose the location of his employer's business was not similarly situated to a person who owned the business and that easing administrative burdens on compensated non-residents did not require a similar reduction on self-employed persons.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that &sect; 6704(d) was unconstitutional and ordered a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. Considering the respective interests of the parties, including the child and state, the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, which required the litigants to share the risk of error in &quot;roughly equal fashion,&quot; satisfied the minimum requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded. The evidentiary standard in a paternity trial, proof by a preponderance of the evidence, as prescribed by statute, did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates filed a class action in equity against defendant city officials seeking injunctive relief from confinement conditions allegedly violating plaintiffs' U.S. Const. amend.

After the court of common pleas required defendants to establish a &quot;one man, one cell&quot; cap on the prison population, and approved stipulations and agreements between the parties, the common pleas court amended its order to provide a rated capacity for each prison. On plaintiffs' motion for a hearing seeking further relief from overcrowding, the court of common pleas entered another order directing inmate population reduction and subsequently held defendants in contempt. After the commonwealth court granted defendants' application to transfer their appeals to the superior court, defendants joined in plaintiffs' request to the court to assume extraordinary jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 726. The court held that the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test was the exclusive test of alleged amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought a curative amendment under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10609.1 (1972). Appellants challenged the total prohibition of multifamily dwellings contained in the Schuylkill Township, Chester County, Pa., Zoning Ordinance (1955) on exclusionary grounds and sought establishment of a new residential district in which appellants could construct such dwellings. Appellee township board of supervisor's finding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally exclusionary because the disputed area was not a logical area for growth and development was affirmed by a trial court and an intermediate appellate court on the basis of a fair-share analysis. The court held that the fair-share analysis did not apply where the ordinance totally excluded a basic form of housing such as apartments and where appellee failed to establish a legitimate public purpose for such exclusion. The court therefore reversed and remanded to the trial court for approval of appellants' proposed development unless appellee could show that the plan was incompatible with the site or reasonable preexisting health and safety codes and regulations.</SPAN></P>

The court granted allocatur to determine the validity of its administrative directives as against the Ethics Act, 65 P.S. &sect; 401 et seq., and to decide whether appellant could be said to have voluntarily quit under the circumstances. In affirming, the court held that its administrative directives, as internal housekeeping matters, had the full force and effect of rules as described in Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c); therefore, 65 P.S. &sect; 410 was suspended as applied to appellant. Forbidding partisan political activity by a court employee did not violate appellant's U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that unless the trial court was convinced that any error was necessarily harmless, it had to vacate the judgment of sentence and grant defendant a new trial. The court held that despite 11 P. S. 2215(a) that provided for confidentiality of child abuse summaries, the trial court erred in when it refused to allow the defense access to the CWS files.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayer and medical assistance recipients, sought review of a decree, which held that funding restrictions on abortions under the Abortion Control Act, 18 Pa.

The court found that the right at issue was the right to have the state subsidize the individual exercise of a constitutionally protected right, when it chose to subsidize alternative constitutional rights. The court held that because &sect; 3201 did not affect a fundamental right or a suspect class, the interest of the state did not need to be compelling in order to sustain the burden of justifying the disparate treatment of two classes of women. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree, and found that appellants did not establish that the commonwealth's denial of funds would fail to accomplish its purpose of preserving the life of the unborn child. Lastly, the court held that &sect; 3201 did not violate Pa. Const. art.

The court further held that the ordinance excluded all other counties from the tax authorization and prevented them from enjoying the benefit, which inured to appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania), which denied his petition for postconviction relief from a death sentence. He argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over his appeal under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-9551. On the merits, appellant argued that he was denied the right to withdraw a guilty plea and that his sentence was disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder. During sentencing, the trial court admitted appellant's guilty plea in another killing. Appellant was sentenced to death, with his plea used as an aggravating circumstance. In two prior appeals, appellant had unsuccessfully challenged the use of his guilty plea and the proportionality of his sentence. Under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9543(4) and &sect; 9549, if an issue had already been litigated by the court, postconviction relief was not available. Appellant's other arguments had been waived. The court addressed the jurisdictional issue at length. The Judicial Code, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 722, gave the court exclusive jurisdiction over all direct appeals of capital cases. Once, the code had also placed exclusive jurisdiction for PCHA cases and felonious homicides with the court. Amendments to the code now placed exclusive jurisdiction for collateral attacks under the PCHA with the Superior Court under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 742.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of multiple offenses, including first degree murder, and sentenced him to death. Among appellant's many issues on appeal were whether his Miranda rights were violated, whether the trial court erred by refusing to grant a motion to change venue, and whether the commonwealth's death penalty laws were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of kidnapping, theft, rape, and first degree murder. Appellant argued that his Miranda rights were violated during questioning. The court found that although appellant was the focus of the investigation when he came in for questioning, he was not under arrest and not entitled to Miranda warnings. Appellant argued that he should have been granted a change of venue because of pretrial publicity. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a change of venue. There was no showing that the empanelled jurors were prejudiced. The pretrial reporting was factual, not inflammatory. The effect of the publicity had dissipated over time. Appellant argued that the commonwealth's death penalty laws were unconstitutional and that the evidence did not support its use. The court noted that the death penalty statute,&nbsp;42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711, had been previously held constitutional. Defendant's single conviction for what were in fact several crimes met the requirement that the jury rely on more than one prior conviction to apply the death penalty. The other aggravating factor, that the murder occurred in commission of a felony, was met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and death sentence. When appellant was not under arrest, he was not entitled to Miranda warnings. Pretrial publicity did not require a change of venue because the empanelled jurors were not prejudiced, the reporting was not inflammatory, and the effect was dissipated by time. The death penalty statute's requirement that jurors balance aggravating and mitigating factors met constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County (Pennsylvania) for three counts of murder of the first degree. The jury, in a separate hearing, found that the two aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances and sentenced defendant to death upon all three counts of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for three counts of murder of the first degree and upheld his sentence of death. The court held that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the murders with premeditation and malice aforethought. The jury had the right to disbelieve defendant's version of what happened. A warrantless seizure of the hair samples and the fingernail clippings and scrapings was reasonable to protect possible evidence connected with the deeds because defendant could have easily destroyed evidence. Pennsylvania's Death Penalty Statute,&nbsp;42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711, provided that if the jury unanimously found that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances, the sentence must be life. If the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, the sentence must be death. The statutory language did not render the statute mandatory. The court held that &sect; 9711 clearly met the requirements of U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV by providing the sentencing authority with the means to give an individualized sentence that considered defendant's character and record and the circumstances of his offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for three counts of murder of the first degree because the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the murders with premeditation and malice aforethought. The court upheld defendant's sentence of death because Pennsylvania's Death Penalty Statute was constitutional and the sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgments of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of first degree murder and imposed the death penalty under 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The sole aggravating circumstance introduced by the prosecution was a prior conviction of second degree murder. The trial court held that the past conviction supported a jury finding that defendant had a substantial history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(9). On direct appeal, the court affirmed the conviction because the evidence clearly supported the finding of guilty, and trial counsel was not ineffective because he declined to pursue lines of defense that were incredible and fantastic and concentrated on the theory originally put forth by defendant. The court reversed the death sentence after it applied the rules of construction to determine that a significant history of violent felonies was not the equivalent of a history of significant felony convictions, and that the legislature did not intend that a single past offense, although serious, would be considered to be an aggravating circumstance. The court remanded the case so that the trial court could impose a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of first degree murder but reversed the imposition of the death sentence and remanded for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, because a single prior conviction of murder was not a significant history of convictions of violent felonies and did not support a finding of an aggravating circumstance needed for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found defendant guilty of the common law crimes of misfeasance, malfeasance, and nonfeasance while he served as a city councilman.

Code &sect; 10.10-100, the breach of which carried a penal sanction. The court affirmed the appellate court's conclusion that the trial court erred. The court held that a common law offense could not include a statutory offense that provided a separate penalty for its violation as an element, where culpability could be based solely on violation of the statutory proscription. The court found that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant could be found guilty of the common law offense if it were found that he breached the positive duty set forth in the statute. The court added that, where a trial court charges both correctly and incorrectly on the same proposition, it is impossible to determine which instruction the jury followed and reversal is necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which held that &sect; 9714 of the Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714, was unconstitutional because it did not require prior convictions to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court imposed a sentence that was less than the minimum under &sect; 9714.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court of aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and possession of an instrument of crime. The trial court concluded that &sect; 9714 of the Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714, which mandated a five-year minimum sentence if the defendant had a prior conviction of an enumerated violent felony within the preceding seven years, was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the prior conviction was an element of the current offense that should proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and declined to apply it. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded because it held that the prior conviction was not an element of the offense, but rather a sentencing restriction that removed the judge's discretion as to the minimum sentence but did not change the maximum sentence. The court found that the commonwealth's interest in protecting the public by punishing violent repeat offenders and deterring violent crime was at least as great as a convicted defendant's interest in leniency. The court held that the preponderance standard prescribed in &sect; 9714 satisfied the minimum requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court and held that proof of a prior conviction for mandatory minimum sentencing purposes was not an element of the instant offense, so that proof by a preponderance of the evidence satisfied due process. The court remanded for resentencing in accordance with the mandatory minimum requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for murder in the first degree and death sentence, and the court sustained the conviction and affirmed the sentence. Evidence sufficiently supported the murder conviction; appellant's glasses were found at the crime scene and blood on his shoes matched the victim's blood. It was not error to deny appellant's motion for change of venue because any sensational publicity about appellant was published for a three-day period and followed by a six-month &quot;cooling off period&quot; that dissipated any resulting prejudice. Appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel by counsel's failure to object to appellee's comments regarding the death penalty; such comments were not reversible error unless they prevented the jury from weighing evidence objectively. It was not error to deny a mistrial when appellee's witness volunteered prejudicial testimony because the jury was promptly instructed to disregard. The &quot;torture&quot; requirement for aggravating circumstances found in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(8) was not unconstitutionally vague because the term was commonly understood, and the jury instructions and evidence submitted on torture were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained appellant's conviction for murder in the first degree and affirmed the death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On application by the commonwealth's attorneys, the court assumed plenary jurisdiction of cases, in various procedural postures, from the Courts of Common Pleas for Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties (Pennsylvania) to determine whether, in a prosecution for drunk driving under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731, a defendant could be admitted to accelerated rehabilitative disposition over the objection of the attorney for the commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In all nine cases, consolidated by the court, the attorneys for the commonwealth had declined to move for the defendant's admission into the accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD) program, but the court, over the objection of the commonwealth and upon motion of defense counsel, ordered that defendants be considered for admission to the program or, in two cases, actually ordered that defendants be admitted to ARD. On application of attorneys for the commonwealth, the court assumed plenary jurisdiction to determine whether, in a prosecution for drunk driving under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731, a defendant may be admitted to ARD over the objection of the attorney for the commonwealth. The court quashed all appeals to the superior court. The court held that district attorneys, under the rules promulgated by the court, had the sole discretion to move for the admission of a defendant into ARD and the failure to have submitted a case for ARD had not imposed a sentence any more than the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in deciding to prosecute the case imposed a sentence. The court held that admission to an ARD program was not a matter of right, but a privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed all appeals to the superior court because the rules governing accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD) were the sole procedure by which a person charged with drunk driving may have been admitted to ARD, and no criminal defendant could have moved for their own admission to ARD.</SPAN></P>

App. P. 702(b), appellant challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted appellant of murder of the first degree, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. Appellant was sentenced to death for the murder charge and imprisonment for the other charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime, and he was sentenced to death for the murder charge. Appellant challenged the conviction and sentence and the court affirmed. Under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9711(h), no circumstances warranted vacating appellant's death sentence. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to sever the consolidated trial with his codefendant. Pa. R. Crim. P. 1127 permitted defendants who participated in the same act to be tried together; evidence against appellant and his codefendant was virtually identical; and appellant failed to articulate the nature of prejudice he would suffer. It was not error to give appellant 10 peremptory challenges instead of the 20 he would have received in a nonconsolidated trial because appellant did not allege or demonstrate prejudice. Nor was it error to refuse to instruct the jury that appellant's murder conviction in a collateral matter, which the jury found to be an aggravating circumstance, was not final. The conviction's nonfinality did not alter its character as an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions of murder in the first degree, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime and his death and imprisonment sentences. Appellant did not show prejudice from being tried with his codefendant or from receiving fewer peremptory challenges than normal, and lack of jury instruction on a nonfinal collateral conviction was not error where the conviction was still an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of decisions from the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County and the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which had convicted each of the five defendants for one of the enumerated offenses found in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of five defendants was convicted of an enumerated offense in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712. In four cases, the trial court held the section was unconstitutional and declined to apply it because the preponderance standard violated due process. In the remaining case, defendant was sentenced to a five-year term of imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and remanded the other four cases so that &sect; 9712 would be applied. The court found that the legislature had explicitly provided in &sect; 9712(b) that the provisions of the section were not an element of the crime, and that because the legislature was charged with defining the elements of crimes, it was within their power to have done so. The court held that &sect; 9712 merely mandated a minimum sentence of five years where defendant stood convicted of a serious felony upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore his right to remain free from confinement had been extinguished. The court further held that &sect; 9712 had satisfied the minimum requirements of U.S. Const. amend. X IV, &sect; 1 and was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed one conviction and remanded the other four because the section in question had satisfied the minimum requirements of the due process clause and was therefore constitutional, where defendant's fundamental right, i.e., freedom from confinement, had already been forfeited and the determination to be made would at most have had bearing only on the duration of confinement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of sentence imposing the death penalty for his conviction of murder in the first degree. The court affirmed the sentence, finding that although defendant was arrested more than three years after the crime; his due process rights were not violated because he had notice that he was a suspect, he departed from the commonwealth, and the police made diligent efforts to locate all of the suspects. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing defendant's challenge for cause of a juror who had a remote relationship to persons involved in the case. The court also held that the trial court properly excluded a potential juror who established an irrevocable commitment to vote against the death penalty. The court further held that the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct by making certain remarks in his opening and closing statements because the fact that the prosecutor had evidence that he chose not to present did not render the opening statement improper. The court, however, modified defendant's death penalty sentence to life imprisonment because he was convicted before the death penalty statute came into effect.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court overturned that holding finding an intent to create a trust in appellee. On appeal, the court reversed judgment. The court held that there are neutral principles of law, developed for use in all property disputes, that could have been applied without &quot;establishing&quot; churches to which property was awarded, and U.S. Const. amend I commanded civil courts to decide church property disputes without resolving underlying controversies over religious doctrine. The court held that like the trial court, they had found no evidence that appellant had ever intended to convey their property interests to appellee because they had always retained all property in their own corporate name.</SPAN></P>

P. 2004 and the evidence seized should have been suppressed. The court reversed for appellant commonwealth. The court held that the lower court erred in concluding that the search violated Rule 2004 and even if it had been violated, suppression of the evidence seized would have been a remedy all out of proportion to the benefits gained. The court found that while Rule 2004 required a law enforcement officer having primary jurisdiction to have actually had &quot;participated&quot; in the service, the requirement had been met by the presence of &quot;jurisdictional police officers&quot; at appellee's apartment, so his rights were not prejudiced by the officer's failure to fully comply with the rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee resident was assessed higher wage taxes than she would have been if she were a non-resident. Appellee challenged the Philadelphia Non-Resident Wage Tax Cap (cap), Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. &sect; 7359(b) (1984) and Philadelphia, Pa., Ordinance (ordinance) 1716 (1983). The cap limited to 4 5/16 percent the rate at which non-residents could be taxed by on income earned in the city. The ordinance levied the city's wage and net profits tax at the rates of 4 5/16 percent on non-residents and 4 96/100 percent on residents. The commonwealth court declared the cap and ordinance unconstitutional. Appellant secretary of revenue sought review. The court reversed because the wage tax scheme complied with the uniformity requirements of the equal protection clause and Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; I. The court found a legitimate distinction between the taxed classes in addition to mere residence. The court held that non-residents and residents were not similarly situated because non-residents utilized the city's police, fire, and sanitation services to a lesser extent and did not enjoy a voice in the city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county and county prison board, filed in the commonwealth court a complaint in mandamus and equity and a motion for a preliminary injunction against appellees, state agencies and associated individuals, following appellees' refusal to authorize the transfer of 76 inmates from the county jail to state prisons so that appellants could comply with a federal district court order to reduce the jail population. Appellees filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The commonwealth court denied appellants' motion and sustained appellees' preliminary objections that dismissed appellants' complaint. The court reversed. The court held that it was the state's obligation to maintain order and preserve the safety and welfare of all citizens; and, as appellees did not place the disputed prisoners in state custody by their own discretion, they had a duty to transfer the prisoners when appellants were unable to meet constitutional standards because of overcrowding. The court also found that the overcrowding and failure of appellees to transfer prisoners warranted the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

It was appellees', state agencies and associated individuals, duty to assist appellants, county and county prison board, in dealing with overcrowding by transferring state prisoners to state facilities; therefore, a preliminary injunction mandating transfer was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth challenged the trial court's ruling that it had no authority to grant use immunity over the objection of the prosecutor in a case where defendant was convicted of criminal conspiracy, possession of instruments of a crime, terroristic threats, simple assault, and rape. The commonwealth argued that witness immunity in Pennsylvania was governed by statute. Under the statute, courts have no power to grant immunity except on request of the prosecutor. Defendant sought a request from the prosecuting attorney for immunity for the compelled testimony of a defense witness. The district attorney declined, and the court had no authority to immunize the witness' testimony absent a request by the prosecutor. The commonwealth had a strong interest in prosecuting both the appellant and the witness, and it refused to go along with the immunity request. Therefore, the court held that the trial court was correct in concluding that it lacked inherent power to grant judicial use immunity to the co-defendant. The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board appealed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania), which held unconstitutional a section of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. &sect; 1-102 (1968) which automatically revoked the license of appellee private club because appellee had been out of operation for two years. The case was remanded for a determination of whether appellee's liquor license should be revoked for other reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board revoked appellee private club's liquor license under the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. &sect; 1-102 (1968) because it had ceased operation for two years. Appellee filed suit. The appellate court held that &sect; 1-102 violated the Equal Protection Clause under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Special Legislation Provision, Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32. The appellate court found no rational basis for allowing inoperative commercial licensees an indefinite time period before revocation, but allowing inoperative club licensees only two years. The court reversed, and held that the liquor laws were rationally based in the state's legitimate interest of protecting public health and safety by regulating the sale of liquor to prevent its abuse. The court found that the lower court erred when it equated the absence of a statement of the reasons supporting &sect; 1-102 with the absence of any rational reason. The court noted the many distinctions between club and nonclub licensees, which included the fact that the main purpose of commercial establishments was the sale of liquor for profit, while the sale of liquor was secondary to that of clubs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's automatic revocation of appellee private club's liquor license under the statute was upheld because the statute's distinction between club licenses and commercial licenses was rationally based on the commonwealth's legitimate interest in protecting public health and safety by regulating the sale of liquor so as to prevent its abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, private corporations and individuals, brought a libel action against defendants, newspapers and reporters, for purporting to link plaintiffs to organized crime. The trial court held in favor of defendants. The court reversed the order and remanded the case for retrial. The court held that the defamatory character of the articles was apparent. The court held that the only restraint mandated by the U.S. Const. amend. I in plaintiffs' action for compensatory damages was that liability could not be imposed upon defendants without fault. The court held that defendants' constitutional freedom of expression was not offended by the burden of proving the truth of the articles about plaintiffs, as long as plaintiffs were required to establish defendants' willful or negligent conduct. The court held that the presumption of falsity remained, and defendants had the option of proving truth as an absolute defense to the action. The court held that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8343(b)(1) was constitutional and the trial court's jury instruction to the contrary was error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order in favor of appellee state employees, which declared unconstitutional and permanently enjoined appellant state education system from enforcing the amendment to the State Employee's Retirement Code. The court ruled that appellant's unilateral reduction of retirement benefits arising from the employment contracts unconstitutionally impaired the contract rights of all existing members of the system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee estate, the holder of a judgment lien against property, filed objections to a tax sale at which appellant buyers, husband and wife, purchased the property. Appellee alleged that it had no notice of the sale from the county tax claim bureau which, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Real Estate Tax Sale Law, 72 P.S. &sect; 5860.602, listed the property for sale in advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation and in the county legal journal. The trial court invalidated the sale and held that the notice provisions of &sect; 5860.602 were unconstitutional. Appellants sought review. The appeals court transferred the case to the supreme court. The court affirmed. The court stated that a judgment is property, and a judgment creditor's interest can not be deprived without due process of law. The general notice provided for by &sect; 5860.602 was inadequate to meet the requirements of due process as far as judgment creditors were concerned. When a judgment creditor was identified in a judgment that was publicly recorded, the constructive notice by publication had to be supplemented by notice mailed to the judgment creditor's last address, or by personal service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior action, the court held that the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act (act), 43 P.S. &sect; 1311 et seq. was unconstitutional as applied to appellant ex-employee. Appellant filed a petition that sought interest on the benefits that were withheld. The appellate court dismissed appellant's petition. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision, and held that appellant's claim was unsupportable on either a statutory basis, a contractual basis, or as a matter of the common law. The court found that appellee State Employees' Retirement Board repaid the benefits, but did not pay the interest that accrued during the period benefits were withheld. The court held that until the act was declared unconstitutional, appellee's action was not only then lawful, but was affirmatively required by the act. Appellee's action could not be characterized as wrongful and, thus, the claim for interest could not proceed under the common law regarding the award of interest damages. The period during which appellee withheld payment was expressly beyond board's statutory and contractual duty to pay interest under the State Employees' Retirement Code, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee plaintiff allegedly injured himself on appellant transportation authority's premises but failed to give notice of his injury within the statutorily proscribed six-month period, 66 P.S. &sect; 2036. Appellant sought review of the lower court's decision that the statute violated the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the statute was constitutional. The court noted that Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 granted the legislature authority to choose cases in which the commonwealth of Pennsylvania would have immunity from actions. The court also noted that the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, created different standards of inquiry for analyzing disputed rules. The court noted that the heightened scrutiny standard was inapplicable because the right involved did not flow directly from the constitution, and instead found that the intermediate standard of review was appropriate because an important interest was implicated. Applying this standard, the court found that the purpose of the statute was an important one and it therefore passed muster under this statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant complained of a number of issues, including a violation of Pa. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant allegedly lured a salesman to his house, where the victim was robbed and shot to death.

The court held that appellant's argument that Pa. R. Crim. P. 1100 was violated because appellee never communicated to appellant that he was wanted in the killing, was frivolous; appellant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights were not violated by a police search consented to by appellant's 16 year old daughter; the trial court correctly allowed the live-in paramour to testify at trial, because appellant and her did not have a common-law marriage; the prosecutor's comments supposedly improperly disparaging appellant's trial counsel's ethics and trial tactics, under the circumstances, did not prejudice appellant; and the death penalty statute,&nbsp;42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of first degree murder and imposed the death sentenced. Appellant was granted a direct appeal, pursuant to 42 P.S. &sect; 9711(h), and contended that a new trial was warranted, primarily due to appellant's claim that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial, based on alleged prosecutor misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, in connection with the shooting death of a police officer. On direct appeal, pursuant to 42 P.S. &sect; 9711(h), the court reviewed the record for errors at trial in addition to those alleged by appellant, and found none warranting relief. Therefore, the court affirmed the death sentence, holding that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial. The court held that the prosecutor, during cross-examination of the only fact witness presented by the defense, discrediting the veracity of the witness, did not warrant the grant of a new trial. The prosecutor's comments did not constitute reversible error, because the unavoidable effect was not to prejudice the jury and form in their minds fixed bias and hostility toward appellant so that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict. Of great significance was the fact that the prosecutor's comments did not relate to the substance of the witness's primary testimony. Constitutional challenges to the death penalty statute, under 42 P.S. &sect; 9711, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, were rejected by the court.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected other complaints about the prosecutor, plus constitutional challenges to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee attorneys participated in an action for medical malpractice that was covered by the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 P.S. &sect; 1301.101 et seq. (1975). After the appellees agreed to a settlement they petitioned the court of common pleas to approve the settlement and attorney fees. The court of common pleas approved the settlement and attorney fees. Appellant Administrator of the Arbitration Panels for Health Care reviewed the petition and determined that only those attorney fees provided under 40 P.S. &sect; 1301-604(a) (1975) were available to the appellees. The lower court, which reviewed appellant's determination at the request of the state attorney general, vacated the decision of appellant. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the entire statutory scheme for arbitration, including the provision limiting attorney fees, was struck down by a prior decision that determined that the legislative grant of jurisdiction for the arbitration scheme was void. Therefore appellant's actions were without a jurisdictional basis.</SPAN></P>

The trial court in instructions to the jury. failed to precisely tract the language in the sentencing code, 42 P.S. &sect; 9711(e), regarding mitigating factors and charged the jury on lesser degrees of homicide without evidence of the lesser charges. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction even though the instructions did not track &sect; 9711(e), because the mitigating circumstance law was adequately, accurately, and clearly expressed to the jury and did not inject prejudice into the process that produced the sentence of death. The court also held that the charge to the jury on lesser degrees of homicide did not introduce an element of arbitrariness into the process.

The trial court dismissed the information against appellee, finding the drunk driving statute,&nbsp;&sect; 3731(a)(4), void for vagueness. On direct appeal, the supreme court reversed and remanded, holding that the vagueness standard required appellee to demonstrate either that the statute failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that contemplated conduct was forbidden or that it encouraged arbitrary and erratic enforcement, which appellee failed to prove. The court found that the legislature intended to impose absolute liability for drunk driving, that this met a compelling state interest in furtherance of its constitutional police powers for the protection of citizens, and that discretion of police, judges, and juries were limited by the statute; thus, the statute was not arbitrary, nor did it allow erratic enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenured faculty member filed a complaint in equity against appellees, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Education, and Bloomsburg State College, and others, arising out of appellee college's denial of his request for sabbatical leave. One count sought relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985, for violation of his equal protection and due process rights. The second count averred the refusal to grant the sabbatical was a breach of a collective bargaining agreement. The lower court dismissed the complaint against appellees on the basis of sovereign immunity. On review the primary issue was whether appellees were entitled to sovereign immunity. The court reversed, holding that appellee's cause of action accrued prior to the 1978 passage of Act 152, 42 Pa. Cons. Ann. &sect; 8522, because appellant applied for a sabbatical each year since 1974 and his applications were denied. Thus, sovereign immunity was not a bar to appellant's action. The court dismissed the second count because it put in issue asserted violations of a labor contract and the dispute fell within the public policy of the Public Employee Relations Act, 43 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court severed charges against appellant of murder, robbery and burglary against three separate victims and appellant was acquitted as to the first victim. As to the other two victims, appellant was found guilty of murder of the first degree, robbery, and two counts of burglary, and received, inter alia, a sentence of death. Appellant challenged his conviction because evidence in the latter trial had been presented in the first trial, U.S. Const. amend.

The court vacated the death sentence and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, and otherwise affirmed judgment. The court held that there was no double jeopardy because the first jury had to determine appellant's guilt or innocence only as to the first victim and not as to the other crimes.

Appellants contended that husband had the right and authority to make the conveyance, and the conveyance was in no way affected by the Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband purchased property in his name only, at which time he married appellee wife. Appellee did not contribute to the purchase price of the land nor was the land ever titled in her name. Appellant husband filed for divorce against appellee, and she countersued. Appellant husband conveyed the property for no monetary consideration to appellant son, his child by a prior marriage. The Pa. Divorce Code (1980) was enacted in April, 1980 and it became effective on July 1, 1980. The statute included provisions for equitable distribution of property, 23 P.S. &sect;&sect; 402-04. Appellee wife petitioned the trial court to have her existing divorce action governed by provisions of the new code, pursuant to &sect; 103. The trial court sustained appellants' preliminary objections to appellee's equity complaint seeking to nullify the conveyance, but the superior court reversed. Appellants challenged, and the court vacated and remanded to the trial court. The court held that the trial court erred in applying 23 P.S. &sect; 403(d) retroactively, which materially altered appellee's vested property rights, in violation of both the U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than six years after the child's birth, appellant mother brought an action against appellee father to establish paternity of the child. Appellant successfully argued that the statute of limitations imposed upon paternity actions, 42 P.S. . &sect; 6704(e), was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment, and appellant petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for a Writ of Certiorari. The Writ was granted, judgment was vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration, in light of Pickett v. Brown, 103 S. Ct. 2199, 76 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1983), of whether the statute violated equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 26. The court reinstated its original order that appellant's claim was barred and that the statute was constitutional because the court found Pickett supportive of its previous holding. The court held that the statute satisfied two requirements, (1) that the time period was sufficiently long to present a reasonable opportunity for claims on a child's behalf, and (2) was substantially related to the state's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information alleged that appellee, while intoxicated, entered an interstate route by driving his automobile the wrong way down an exit ramp, and that while travelling north in the southbound lanes of the interstate, appellee's vehicle struck an oncoming vehicle, killing one of its occupants. Appellee was charged with homicide by vehicle in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732. The trial court granted appellee's pre-trial motion to quash the information as far as it charged appellee with homicide by vehicle. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the Pennsylvania legislature's enactment of &sect; 3732 was a constitutional exercise of its lawmaking authority. The judgment by the legislature to borrow from the concepts of tort law in imposing liability under &sect; 3732 bore a rational relationship to the legislature's goal of reducing highway fatalities. By focusing on drivers who knew that they were engaging in conduct constituting a statutory violation of which death was a probable consequence, &sect; 3732 sought only to sanction those persons who should have anticipated that their conduct was likely to produce death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convicted felon was found guilty on retrial of two counts of murder of the first degree, conspiracy, and aggravated assault. The death penalty was returned on both counts of murder. The convictions were challenged and subsequently certified to the court. The court held that even if the trial court erred when it disallowed appellant's impeachment questions the error was harmless because appellant fully explored the witness' motive to testify. A witness' unresponsive answer about threats on his life was opened by appellant on cross-examination and so was within the scope of redirect. A mug shot that was not admitted into evidence or shown to the jury was not an improper suggestion of prior criminal activity on the part of appellant. The photograph had probative value and was not inflammatory. Appellant's counsel was not ineffective for having failed to request a jury instruction as to the photograph's evidentiary value. The court vacated the death sentences and imposed life sentences because the 1978 death penalty statute, 1978 Pa.

When appellant attempted to join appellee as an additional defendant, appellee filed preliminary objections to the joinder. The trial court sustained the preliminary objections and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the issue was whether appellee, although statutorily immune from liability, could nonetheless be joined by appellant for the purpose of apportioning appellee's negligence with the negligence of appellant. The court affirmed, holding that the lower courts properly held that joinder of appellee as a defendant for any purpose was barred by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 481 (Supp. 1983). The court found the Comparative Negligence Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7102, did not reflect a legislative intent to permit joinder of an employer as an additional defendant for the purpose of apportioning fault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's order affirming the trial court's order which sustained appellee employer's preliminary objections to joinder as a defendant because the trial court properly read the Comparative Negligence Act to be consistent with the legislative intent of the Workers' Compensation Act to grant immunity to employers in employee actions against third-party tortfeasors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner bank sought a refund of bank shares tax paid for the tax year 1978, claiming that the bank shares tax imposed improperly reflected a tax on two classes of assets: obligations of the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742; and state and municipal obligations, in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 4752-2 (Supp.1983). The Board of Finance and Revenue refused the petition. The court vacated the order, holding that the bank shares tax assessed against petitioner improperly took into consideration obligations of the United States owned by petitioner in violation of the plain language of 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742 because the tax was computed on the basis of equity capital, which in turn was determined, in part, by United States obligations. However, the court held petitioner was incorrect in asserting that its state and municipal obligations could not be taken into consideration because it was clear that the bank shares tax was imposed on capital owned and employed by petitioner in its banking operations, which capital was a property interest separate from the state and municipal obligations themselves.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the Board of Finance and Revenue refusing the petition for refund of improper taxation of petitioner bank's state and municipal obligations because obligations of the United States owned by petitioner were improperly taken into consideration in computing petitioner's bank shares tax; the record was remanded to the board for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public utility appealed the order of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled in favor of appellee, Secretary, Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, and denied appellant's request for relief. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying mandamus, and in refusing to order appellee to issue formal settlements on tax returns, under the Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PURTA), 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 8101-A through 8108-A (1982-83).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pa. Const. art. VIII was amended in 1968 to explicitly subject the real property of public utilities to real estate taxes. The Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PURTA), 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 8101-A through 8108-A (1982-83), was first enacted in 1970. Appellant public utility timely filed its PURTA tax returns for the year 1969 through 1973 with appellee, Department of Revenue. No formal settlement was made by appellee on these returns until March 15, 1977, when appellee was advised by the attorney general that 72 P.S. &sect; 8102-A(c) imposed a duty to settle PURTA taxes. Thereafter, appellee began settling all subsequent PURTA tax returns until advised by memorandum of August 6, 1980, that settlements were not required unless the Department of Revenue was unwilling to accept the PURTA taxpayer's self-assessment. Appellee did not settle appellant's PURTA tax returns for the years 1969 through 1973. Appellant challenged the trial court order which denied its request for mandamus relief. The court affirmed, and held that in the absence of any explicit statutory directive, mandamus would not lie against the state or one of its officials to compel a formal settlement of public utility taxes by appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed the grant of a motion in arrest of judgment for the state's attorney's failure to meet the signature requirements of Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted at trial of theft by unlawful taking and two separate criminal conspiracies. Both the trial and intermediate courts granted defendant's motion for arrest of judgment by holding that an information signed by the rubber-stamped signature of a district attorney was void ab initio. The state appealed the decision, reasoning that the meaning of the word &quot;signed&quot; was ambiguous, and was not dispositive of whether a rubber-stamped signature met the requirements of Pa. R. Crim. P. 225(b). The court granted review and reversed and remanded the lower courts' judgment for sentencing. The court reasoned that the explanation given for rejecting the rubber-stamped signature did not address the dangers that an information may be filed in error or without proper review. The court also stated that allowing defendant's discharge would be an anomaly not because the informations were wrongly filed against him, or that his case's defense was prejudiced by the state's actions, or because there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction, but because the state's attorney misinterpreted the requirement for one type of signature over another. Such a result was not justified.</SPAN></P>

The explanation for rejecting the rubber-stamped signature did not address the dangers that an information may be erroneously filed or not properly reviewed. Further, to allow defendant to be discharged would be anomalous because of a failure to properly interpret the requirement of a specific type of signature over another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that had denied appellant's, commonwealth, attorney general, and district attorney writ of mandamus because it found that that the lower court properly determined that the Public Employees Forfeiture Act (Act), 43 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1311-1315 did not apply to the former mayor. Appellants sought to have the pension benefits of the former mayor terminated because he had been convicted of a crime three months prior to his resignation. The court found that the Act had not been passed at the time of the mayor's resignation and that the legislature could not require the retroactive application of the Act. The court held that retirement provisions for public employees was in the form of deferred compensation for service actually rendered in the past and that modifications to the retirement system could not be adverse to a member who had met the eligibility requirements. The court held that the contract rights of the former mayor were determined on the date of membership in the retirement system and could not be reached by the retroactive forfeiture provision of the Act, therefore appellee, retirement board, had correctly paid the pension benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, defendants appealed decisions of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted them of criminal offenses after denying them their rights to waive trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were tried and convicted by juries for various criminal offenses. Each had filed motions to waive trial by jury, but were denied their requests. The court remanded, holding that the right to trial by jury was not a substantive right but a right of procedure through which rights conferred by substantive law were enforced. The court held that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 5104(c), which contravened Pa. R. Crim. P. 1101, was an unconstitutional infringement upon the procedural rule making authority of the courts conferred by Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10. Under Rule 1101, the prosecution could control accused's motion to waive trial by jury. By conferring on the prosecution an absolute right to jury trial, the trial court would be precluded from exercising discretion of Rule 1101 in assessing whether a non-jury trial should be permitted. The court found that the trial court erroneously denied the requests of three of the defendants, but the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying one in the interest of that defendant obtaining a fair trial, which he probably could not have gotten after the trial court was exposed to his criminal record during pre-trial proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded after determining that the trial court properly denied only one request for the right to waive a jury trial because of pretrial evidence that might have tainted the trial judge, and determining that the trial court erred in denied three other requests. The court found that to give a prosecutor an absolute right to a jury trial would destroy the trial court's discretion in determining whether a defendant could waive his right.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 9711(h)(1), defendant challenged the judgment of sentence of death imposed in the Twelfth Judicial District of Pennsylvania. Defendant claimed the procedures for imposition of a sentence of death, set down in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9711, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An automatic appeal followed defendant's conviction for murder. Defendant offered a defense of diminished capacity in an attempt to reduce the degree of guilt from murder of the first to murder of the third degree. The court held that the testimony of defendant's grandmother, mother, and other witnesses who came into contact with defendant after the homicide, as well as defendant's expert who testified concerning defendant's inability to control himself under certain circumstances, was inadmissible on defendant's mental capacity to premeditate, deliberate, and form the specific intent to kill. The court found that the jury instructions were proper and that the state proved an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. The court sustained the conviction of murder in the first degree and affirmed the sentence of death. The court held that the sentence of death for murder of the first degree that involved the aggravating circumstance of killing a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony was not excessive or disproportionate to the sentence imposed in similar cases, and not cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment within the proscription of the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions, and that the sentencing procedures adopted by the legislature were permissible. The court sustained the conviction of murder of the first degree and affirmed the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court denied appellant coal haulers' request for equitable relief against appellees, commonwealth and insurers, dismissed all of appellant's legal claims against appellee commonwealth on the basis of sovereign immunity, and remanded appellant's remaining legal claims against appellee insurers.

The court found that the statute creating sovereign immunity could not be retroactively applied to preclude appellants' trespass claims. The court concluded that the lower court was correct in declining to consider appellants' equitable claims.

The local setback requirements were not arbitrary, capricious and confiscatory, as all zoning involved a &quot;taking&quot; in the sense that the owner was not completely free to use his property as he choose, but such a taking did not entitle the owner to relief, unless the owner's rights had been unreasonably restricted. Appellant failed to meet its burden of proving either that the setback requirements bore no substantial relationship to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community or that the setback requirements were so patently unreasonable to be invalid as arbitrary, confiscatory and a deprivation of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant executrix's sister, a domiciliary of Pennsylvania, executed a will leaving her entire estate to appellant. Appellant subscribed as an attesting witness. The estate was various assets in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The property was sold and intestate heirs excepted to distribution of the proceeds. The trial court sustained the exceptions, holding that since testator died in 1974, the law then in New Jersey denied an attesting witness benefit under the will. Thus, intestacy as to the proceeds of the New Jersey property was declared. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that both Pennsylvania and New Jersey agreed that the testator's intent was of primary importance. The testator clearly stated that her intention was to give the property to appellant and that intent was to be fulfilled. New Jersey was not denied its inherent right to regulate title. Only the proceeds were left to be distributed. No policy of either state was offended by giving testator the intent of her will. The will itself was not contested as to testatrix' intent. The property passed without restraint and the proceeds were collected, and appellant was entitled to the proceeds.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to two and one-half to nine years' imprisonment. The appellate court affirmed. In affirming the appellate court's order, the court ruled that the trial court had not erred in admitting a revolver found next to defendant into evidence because the revolver was within an area of defendant's immediate control that was properly searched incident to a lawful arrest. Thus, no search warrant or probable cause was necessary. The court also held that where police had announced their identity and waited for up to one minute before entering the dwelling, communication of their purpose was unnecessary. The court further found that defendant failed to establish a defense to the escape offense because alleged overcrowding and poor medical care in prison did not constitute force against defendant's person under 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, retired state employees, challenged the denial of their retirement benefits by appellant, State Employees' Retirement Board. Appellant denied the benefits to appellees because of their dismissal from their jobs for criminal activity. Appellees filed a petition for review, invoking the original jurisdiction of the trial court and attacking the constitutionality of the Public Employee Forfeiture Act (the Act), 43 P.S. &sect; 1311 et seq., under which they had been denied benefits due to their criminal activity while employed by the state. The trial court directed appellant to enforce appellees' retirement benefits. The court held that appellees had vested retirement rights prior to July 8, 1978 that were unaffected by the retroactive application of a law that was not in effect at the time of appellees' wrongdoings and that to apply such a law to appellees was unconstitutional. The court held that the Act did not create a condition precedent of faithful service but merely clarified its scope by listing specified crimes. Appellees had obviously met all of the requirements necessary to receive retirement pay under the Act.</SPAN></P>

Appellees whose rights vested prior to the Act's enactment were entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

The lower court vacated appellant's order, and held that appellant had improperly created an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption that a father's income was available to his children living in the same household for AFDC purposes. On appeal, the court reversed and held that because AFDC eligibility was a creation of federal law, the exclusion was permissible. The court held that the provisions of the Social Security Act (Act), which established that only two classes of dependent children were eligible for AFDC assistance, those who were deprived of parental support by reason of the death, absence, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and those who were deprived of parental support by reason of the unemployment of one of their parents, were constitutional. The provisions of 55 Pa. Code &sect; 183.44 that established procedures for the calculation of AFDC grants conformed to the Act and did not violate the due process requirements of U.S. Const. amend.

(Supp. 1981), the trial court refused the request of appellant wife, pursuant to 23 P.S. &sect; 401(d) (Supp. 1981), for equitable distribution of property acquired before the Code's effective date on the belief that the requested distribution would have unconstitutionally deprived appellee husband of his property rights. In reversing the order and remanding the case, the court held that there was no legislative basis for restricting the applicability of the equitable distribution requirement to only that marital property acquired after the effective date of the Code. The court also concluded that where equitable distribution of property acquired during the marriage only occurred upon divorce, only in cases where it was justified, and only in amounts warranted by the facts, the application of the distribution provision to property acquired prior to the Code's effective date was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature conferred upon appellant the right to a stay or supersedeas upon a showing of compliance with the procedural requirements of 71 P.S. &sect; 732-204(b), and that there was no conferral of judicial discretion to grant or deny a stay. If a stay was not granted, and the trial court agreed that the regulation was improper, that finding could provoke a lawsuit against the agency by those adversely affected by the regulation, and appellant would have established the liability of his own client. Here, the procedural prerequisites were met, so the court reversed the trial court's order and granted a stay pending final resolution of appellant's petition for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, interested individuals, challenged appellee Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission's Final Legislative Reapportionment Plan (final plan), claiming that district deviations from compactness and subdivision boundaries were constitutionally only permissible under Pa.

The court found that appellants had the burden of establishing that appellee's final plan did not meet constitutional requirements. The court held the final plan complied with Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, and declared it to have the force of law under Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 17(e), holding that the final plan achieved an equality of population closer to the constitutional ideal of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; than any previous reapportionment plan in the history of the commonwealth, because the range of deviation between the highest and lowest populated districts was only 1.9 percent from the ideal Senate district and 2.8 percent from the ideal House district.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been tried and convicted of murder in the first degree. He appealed the judgment of sentence of death. The court set aside the death sentence and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment because appellant was subject to punishment only under the law preceding 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711.The previous law governing the case had been declared unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the death penalty. It would have been contrary to due process to subject appellant to the death penalty on retrial where he had originally had been sentenced to life imprisonment. It would have been an impermissible penalty for the exercise of appellate rights. The sole permissible maximum punishment for appellant's crime committed prior to application of the new death penalty statute was life imprisonment. A statute was required to be construed to avoid unconstitutional results. Where the application of the death penalty statute on retrial would have violated equal protection and due process, the statute had to be construed not to apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff court personnel requested that defendant county commissioners provide funding in their new budget for more staff positions which were based upon the court's immediate and anticipated future needs. After negotiations failed, plaintiff sought a grant of plenary jurisdiction which was granted along with remanding the matter for an expedited hearing before the intermediate court. The intermediate court did not render a judgment but made findings of fact which included determinations that plaintiff had met the burden of proof showing reasonable necessity as to many of the new staff positions, but not all. Both parties challenged the intermediate court's findings. Upon review, the court maintained ins disinterested status and modified the findings of fact to varying degrees, mainly in favor of plaintiff. It found that plaintiff correctly had the burden of proving reasonable necessity and had mostly maintained that burden. Defendants claimed that the intermediate court erred in denying them their right to a jury trial, but this was dismissed as plaintiffs' action was based in legal and equitable principles, and as such, no jury trial right existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the findings of fact of the intermediate court to various degrees, but generally ruled in favor of plaintiff court personnel's requests to budget for more staff positions and its request for cost of living wage increase. Further, the court found that plaintiff had carried its burden of proof and that defendants were properly denied a jury trial because the legal and equitable nature of the action did not require such a trial.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that issues already litigated could not be relitigated by appellant by raising them in his PCHA petition. The court held that the issue of appellant's confession had already been considered by the court; thus the issue could not be relitigated. The court noted that appellant did not offer any evidence to establish that any extraordinary circumstance existed which would have excused his failure to raise this issue at an earlier proceeding, nor did appellant offer any evidence to rebut the presumption that his failure to raise the issue was knowing and understanding.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that appellee, in his capacity as a solicitor, was neither a public employee, nor a public official within the scope of the Act and, therefore, was not statutorily compelled to comply with the Act's financial disclosure requirements. Absent a clear expression of legislative intent to treat municipal solicitors differently from others who served government in an advisory capacity with neither powers of sovereignty, nor attributes of a public employee, the court concluded that the financial disclosure provisions of the Act did not apply to appellee, who served his municipal clients just as any privately employed attorney served his clients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) that held that Pa. R. Civ. P. 238, which pertained to prejudgment interest, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania promulgated Pa. R. Civ. P. 238, which provided for prejudgment interest in certain instances. The trial court held the rule to be unconstitutional. The supreme court reversed. The court noted that pursuant to Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(c), the court was empowered to prescribe procedural rules if they did not abridge, enlarge, or modify the substantive rights of litigants. However, the line between procedure and substantive rights could be drawn only in light of the rule's purpose. The court stated that federal diversity and conflicts of law cases, where interest as an element of damages had been characterized as substantive law, did not control. Pa. R. Civ. P. 238, when viewed from the perspective of its purpose and goal to aid in the orderly and efficient administration of justice, was procedural and within the power of the court to promulgate. The rule violated neither equal protection nor substantive due process, because it advanced the objective of the rule in a manner consistent with the precepts of equal protection, and it was rationally related to the legitimate state goal of encouraging settlement offers in tort litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had held that the prejudgment interest rule was unconstitutional. Promulgation of the rule was within the constitutional powers of the court, and the rule violated neither equal protection nor substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, elected school directors, challenged the judgment of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held that the Public Officials Ethics Law, 65 P.S. 401 et seq. (Supp. 1980-1981), did not violate the constitutions of Pennsylvania or of the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Public Officials Ethics Law (Act), 65 P.S. 401 et seq. (Supp. 1980-1981), required that candidates for public office, elected officials, and certain appointed officials file financial disclosure statements. Appellants, elected school directors, filed an action against appellees, governor and other state officials, and alleged that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court held the legislation was constitutional, except for 65 P.S. 402, which the court severed. That section exempted from the disclosure requirements appointed officials who received no compensation other than reimbursement for expenses. The court noted that because all school board members served without compensation, the Act distinguished between board members who were elected and those who were appointed. The court held that the classification was not reasonable, but was arbitrary, and that it acted upon a difference having no fair and substantial relation to the object of the act. However, the Act did not violate the constitutional right to privacy because its intrusion into appellants' private affairs was reasonably tailored to fit a legitimate legislative function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, insofar as the trial court held that certain provisions that granted exemption from financial disclosure requirements under the Public Officials Ethics Law were constitutional, but otherwise affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which held that the Public Officials Ethics Law did not violate the constitutions of Pennsylvania or the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured wife sought damages from appellee husband for injuries she sustained in an automobile accident as a result of his negligence. Appellee motioned for summary judgment based upon interspousal immunity, which was granted by the trial court. The lower court's determination was affirmed on appellate review, but appellant continued to challenge the findings. The court, after lengthy review of historical statutes and the Married Persons Property Act, 48 P.S. &sect; 1-1 et seq., determined that interspousal immunity should be abolished and reversed the lower courts. In so holding, the court determined that the spousal role in modern society had changed and to rely on an antiquated doctrine was illogical and failed to serve public policy. The court reasoned that family harmony was not served and, especially in light of insurance indemnification, the otherwise resulting financial hardship would only serve as a detriment to such harmony. The court also noted the potential methods of indirect recovery in support of its decision to abolish the doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's complaint to the board of viewers was confirmed by the trial court after a de novo trial, but was reversed by the appellate court. Appellant claimed that the appellate court's decision denied it the right to a trial de novo by usurping the factfinding function of the trial court. The court held that the appellate court did not exceed its authority, but that it had resolved the matter improperly. Thus, it reversed the appellate court's order. The court disagreed with the appellate court's decision that appellee was not required to pay appellant for the cost to replace the condemned bridge. Although the court determined that such costs were includable in a damage award, it was unable to make the cost determination from the record before it because the condemned bridge had no ascertainable fair market value. Therefore, the court remanded for an evidentiary hearing. The court held that the Pennsylvania constitution did not allow appellee to escape its financial obligation to a public condemnee for property taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A settlor died leaving a trust for the benefit of her grandchildren. A dispute arose as to whether appellant, grandchild born out of wedlock, was entitled to share the trust income with appellants, other two grandchildren. Appellant trustee had reserved a portion of trust income against the possibility that appellant, grandchild born out of wedlock, might be entitled to share. The court modified the decree of the lower court, and as modified, affirmed it. The court held that, although all three grandchildren were to share future trust income equally, on the record before the court, appellant, grandchild born out of wedlock, could recover only the amount of past trust income which appellant trustee had reserved pending final adjudication of the parties' claims. The lower court properly held unconstitutional the canon of construction on the &quot;burden of inertia&quot; which barred appellant, grandchild born out of wedlock, from the enjoyment of trust income. Neither 20 P.S. &sect; 180.14(7) nor 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2514(8) had any rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose, and therefore both were constitutionally infirm under the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

The trial court found that the forfeiture provisions of the Act violated defendant's right to due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and the applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution, in that they failed to mandate notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to forfeiture. The commonwealth appealed on the grounds that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the forfeiture provisions of the Act. The court, without reaching the constitutional issues involved, reversed, holding that defendant did not have standing to question the constitutionality of the Act absent a showing that his constitutional rights were violated by its enforcement. The court noted that even if the forfeiture provisions of the Act were unconstitutional on their face, any violation of defendant's rights that would have resulted from strict compliance with the Act had been prevented by the actual notice and opportunity for hearing that defendant received.</SPAN></P>

Since public policy would have been offended by permitting a political subdivision to use public funds to purchase &quot;insurance&quot; against court-ordered and statutorily-mandated refunding of taxes collected unlawfully, the refunds had to be paid out of budget appropriations of public funds. Because Pennsylvania's public policy did not permit a school district to make unlawful taxation as revenue-productive as lawful taxation, it was concluded that a political subdivision's return of tax monies to its taxpayers collected by an unlawful tax was uninsurable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the plea bargain, and the reviewing court held that the plea colloquy was inadequate, and granted defendant a new trial. Prior to retrial, defendant filed a pretrial motion in which he contended that the prosecution's intention to proceed against him on a charge of first degree murder would violate double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion. On interlocutory appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court's approval of defendant's plea bargain to lesser charges did not constitute an implied acquittal on the greater charges or give the trial court a full opportunity to return a verdict on the greater charges. Further, the due process clause was not offended by the possibility of increased punishment upon defendant's retrial because there was no realistic likelihood of vindictiveness. The court held that where defendant revoked his plea bargain, it was not vindictive to require defendant to assume his pre-agreement status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) which held that the statute authorizing peremptory challenges was unconstitutional as applied in the selection of jurors for defendant's trial. The court entered its order after a hearing on defendant's motion to prevent the commonwealth from exercising its peremptory challenges without restriction to strike black prospective jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a black man, was accused of the murder of a white inmate in the prison where he was incarcerated. At trial, the commonwealth challenged the first venireman, who was black. Defendant requested an evidentiary hearing and the trial court found prima facie case of discrimination in the commonwealth's using peremptory challenges on black jurors. The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded. Defendant could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination merely by producing evidence of a past exclusionary practice by the commonwealth. There was no proof that the challenged practice was been applied to defendant, thereby causing deprivation of a constitutional right. The prosecutor's peremptory challenge of one black prospective juror, the only venireman to be questioned on individual voir dire, accompanied by opinion evidence as to the practice of some individual assistant district attorneys in past trials, was insufficient to raise the inference of improper use of the peremptory challenge by the commonwealth. The trial court erred in finding that defendant had established a prima facie case of discriminatory exclusion of black prospective jurors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that defendant did not establish that the commonwealth impermissibly exercised its peremptory challenges to strike black prospective jurors in the trial of his case.

The trial court dismissed, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment because decedent was injured in the scope of his employment, and therefore appellant could recover only workmen's compensation benefits from the employer or the employer's workmen's compensation carrier. The court held that 77 P.S. &sect; 303 afforded the exclusive remedy to appellant for decedent's injuries unless the employer voluntarily relinquished the protection of the liability.

The action was dismissed because the Pennsylvania Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 P.S. &sect; 1301.101 et seq.&nbsp;(Act), deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. Petitioner appealed to have the court assume plenary jurisdiction over her appeal of the dismissal and of another action for declaratory judgment. The court consolidated both actions and transferred them for an evidentiary hearing. The hearing revealed high percentages of cases which had been filed under the Act but had not been resolved. The court granted the declaratory judgment for petitioner, reversed the order dismissing the complaint in trespass, and remanded. The court declared that 40 P.S. &sect; 1301.309, giving health care arbitration panels original, exclusive jurisdiction over medical malpractice claims, was unconstitutional. The court found that the lengthy delay, caused by the arbitration system, burdened the right of a jury trial with onerous conditions, restrictions, or regulations which made the right practically unavailable.</SPAN></P>

Section 3732 defined &quot;homicide by vehicle&quot; as a death caused by any person's conduct violating law or municipal ordinance applying to vehicles or traffic regulation.

The court disagreed with defendant's contention that &sect; 3732&nbsp;unconstitutionally imposed criminal liability without fault and found that &sect; 3732 required the commonwealth to establish that it was defendant's conduct which caused death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) and claimed his right to a speedy trial had been violated by a two-year delay between the jury's verdict and imposition of sentence and that the court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on the defense of alibi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he appealed. The court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial and held that the delay of almost two years did not extend beyond the collective maximum term of imprisonment for the offenses which defendant was convicted and therefore the period of delay did not render the sentencing invalid. The court further held that the delay was neither purposeful nor oppressive and therefore defendant's right to a speedy trial had not been violated. However the court also held that the evidence that placed defendant at locations distinct from vicinity of the crime was sufficient to raise an alibi defense and although there was substantial evidence of defendant's guilt on the record, defendant was entitled to an alibi instruction and the absence of such an instruction was reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial and found defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because delay did not exceed the term of imprisonment for offense defendant was convicted of, but that trial court erred when it failed to provide jury with alibi instruction because defendant presented sufficient evidence to raise reasonable doubt as to his presence at the scene of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The trial court taxed appellee with costs, including those accruing from the change of venue. The superior court reversed the order and held that appellee was liable only for the amount of necessary costs if trial had taken place in the county where the complaint was filed. On the commonwealth's appeal the court held that recoupment of the costs accruing from a change of venue did not constitute a penalty and did not impose a chilling effect on appellee's constitutional right to a fair trial. The superior court's order was reversed and the case was remanded for a hearing at which the burden would be on the commonwealth to demonstrate which costs were necessary; if any costs were attributable solely to charges which were dismissed on appellee's motion, apportionment of costs would be required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant flood victims suffered loss of life, limb and property when a dam flooded their community in July 1977. Various trespass actions were filed by appellants against appellee commonwealth and department of environmental resources between July and October 1978, alleging negligent supervision of the dam. In September 1978 the legislature passed a sovereign immunity act codified at 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5110. The lower court consolidated the cases pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 213(a). Appellees filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of immunity, and the motion was granted. The court held that appellants' cause of action accrued on the date of the flood and thus had accrued before the sovereign immunity act was implemented. The court held that application of the act to appellants' action was not constitutional. It held that the prior case law that abrogated sovereign immunity was applicable to the case. It reversed the orders and remanded the consolidated case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The consolidated case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor news media petitioned for exercise of plenary jurisdiction and summary reversal of an order from the lower court (Pennsylvania), which denied intervenor's motion for an open suppression hearing to be held in connection with the prosecution of defendant for sexually assaulting and supplying drugs to a high school student.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court noted that the instant closure order had been entered pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 323(f) at the express request of the defense and concurred in by the state. The court then rejected defendant's contention that, although sequestration would protect his U.S. Const. amend. VI rights, defendant's right of privacy would have been jeopardized by the use of sequestration in the instant case. The court found that the accepted remedy for the protection of the privacy right was the application of the doctrine of exclusion, noting that defendant was urging for a more stringent remedy without sufficient justification of the need for such additional protection. The court accordingly granted the request for extraordinary jurisdiction, reversed the denial of intervenor news media's motion for an open suppression hearing, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court concluded that in light of the availability of sequestration, which fully protected defendant's fair trial rights, did not impede the case's orderly resolution or unduly increase the administrative costs, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to deny public access to the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted intervenor news media's petition for extraordinary jurisdiction and reversed the order denying the motion to open the suppression hearing in question. It was improper to close the proceedings where defendant's fair trial considerations were fully satisfied by a means which did not intrude upon the public's access to criminal proceedings and the prosecution and the orderly administration of justice were not adversely affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas, Erie County (Pennsylvania), in an action involving the consolidation of separate informations, use of photographs as evidence, appellant's statements about the use of drugs, and the right to due process of law in the application of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 302.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered the 87-year-old victim's residence. In order to prevent her from later identifying him, he struck her in the face with an isometric exercise bar. He was found guilty of murder of the first degree and burglary. On direct appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the consolidation of separate informations would not be disturbed because the charges were interrelated and arose out of one criminal episode. Police photographs of the blood-stained curtain, wall, and the position of the lower portion of the body and a recent photograph of the victim with her grandchildren, were relevant in that they corroborated commonwealth's version of the homicide and showed whether the victim would have been able to flee as appellant described. Appellant's statements concerning the sale and use of drugs made less than an hour before the crime were an integral part of the events and of his apprehension; they were outside the scope of the general rule of exclusion. Instructing the jury on 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 302, which disallows voluntary intoxication as a defense, did not deny appellant his right to due process of law; &quot;intoxication&quot; was not unreasonably vague or standardless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, because consolidation of the information for murder of the first degree and for burglary was proper where there was only one criminal episode; admission of photographs that were not excessively gruesome nor inflammatory was not error; statements regarding drug use were admissible to establish appellant's identity; and statutory use of &quot;intoxication&quot; to disallow defense of voluntary intoxication was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of orders from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which upheld the administrative orders from the hearing board for appellee Department of Environmental Resources that directed appellants, pursuant to 35 P.S. &sect; 691.316, first to conduct drilling and water sampling to determine the precise amount and dispersion of the pollutant pooled under the subject property, and then to remove it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court held that 35 P.S. &sect; 691.316 clearly and unambiguously authorized appellee Department of Environmental Resources to require the correction of water pollution causing conditions without regard to the source of the pollution, noting that the legislative history also supported such an interpretation. The court then found that a consideration of the history of The Clean Streams Law compelled the court to reject appellant property owners' limited view of the statute's broad purpose in combating water pollution generally. The court determined that the challenged statute was a permissible exercise of the police power under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, noting that the interests of the public required the interference authorized by the statute, and that the means used by appellee were reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the statutory purpose, and not unduly oppressive upon individuals. The court affirmed, concluding that the validity of the challenged exercise of police power over appellants' land had depended little upon appellants' responsibility for causing the condition that gave rise to the pollution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders that required appellant property owners to correct the conditions that were causing water pollution on their property, concluding that appellee Department of Environmental Resources was properly authorized, under a valid exercise of police power, to require the correction of such pollution without regard to its source or the lack of appellants' fault in creating the condition that had given rise to the pollution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on parole, appellant parolee was convicted of various charges.

The case was remanded to the commonwealth court for resolution of the issue of court-appointed counsel. Treating his petition as one for mandamus, the commonwealth court found appellant was not entitled to appointed counsel and denied him relief. He again appealed. In reversing, the supreme court ruled that appellant's petition was not for mandamus, but was an appeal of right from an administrative agency, guaranteed by Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 9. Also, an indigent parolee was entitled to appointed counsel in parole revocation proceedings before appellee because it was a critical stage at which a substantial right might be affected. It followed, then, that appellant was constitutionally entitled to appointed counsel in the appeal from revocation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying appellant relief was reversed and the case was remanded for appointment of counsel and further proceedings because appellant's action before the commonwealth court was not a mandamus action, but was a constitutionally guaranteed appeal from the action of an administrative agency, and he had a constitutional right to appointed counsel for both revocation proceedings before appellee and appeals from such proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, Cumberland County (Pennsylvania), suppressing both the pre and post-arrest statements obtained from appellee as well as the results of a post-arrest breathalyzer test in a driving under the influence case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. The trial court, based upon pre-trial motions, ordered the suppression of both pre and post-arrest statements the police obtained from appellee as well as the results of a post-arrest breathalyzer test. The court held that the trial court correctly suppressed appellee's pre-arrest statement because the police failed to read appellee his Miranda rights. The court affirmed the order insofar as it suppressed appellee's pre-arrest statement. However, the court found that the trial court suppressed the post-arrest statements and results of the post-arrest breathalyzer test on an erroneous theory that appellee's arrest was unlawful. Accordingly, the court vacated the trial court's decision to the extent it suppressed the post-arrest statements and the results of the post-arrest breathalyzer test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part because the suppression of appellee's pre-arrest statement that was made before he was charged with drunken driving was proper because he was not informed of his Miranda rights.

It found no merit to his claims that his revocation hearing was held in an untimely manner or that his incarceration in a diagnostic and classification center after his recommitment was cruel and unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer attempted to intervene in an action brought by the Pennsylvania state attorney general to request an order directing that a multi-county investigating grand jury be summoned. As intervenor, he sought dismissal of the attorney general's application, and the attorney general argued that the taxpayer was without standing as an intervenor or as a petitioner. The court initially granted petitioner's application to intervene, because it said he had standing as a taxpayer seeking to prevent waste of tax revenue for allegedly illegal expenditures. The court found that the purpose of the standing requirement was to protect against improper plaintiffs. To meet the standing requirement, a plaintiff had to prove his interest in the action's outcome surpassed the common interest of all citizens in procuring obedience to the law. The court concluded that petitioner's interest was not immediate, because the detriment to the taxpayer was too remote and he was not directly affected by the loss. In vacating the order granting intervention, the court held that the taxpayer did not have standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated its order granting intervention to petitioner taxpayer and dismissed the petition for review. It held that petitioner was without standing to advance the actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition to adopt a child. The child's natural mother consented to her adoption by appellant. The natural father executed a qualified consent, retaining his parental rights. The trial court denied appellant's petition for adoption, holding the natural father's consent did not meet the statutory requirements for adoption by a nonspouse. The court affirmed. The Adoption Act, 1 P.S. &sect;&sect; 101 et seq. (1978), required, as a prerequisite to adoption, either the unqualified consent of natural parents or the termination of their parental rights. The only provision for a qualified consent was contained in 1 P.S. &sect; 503. By its express terms, section 503 was limited to adoption by the spouse of a natural parent. Only in such intra-family adoptions could a natural parent execute a valid consent retaining parental rights. And only in such a husband-wife relationship was the qualified consent legally sufficient for the spouse seeking to become an adopting parent. Appellant was not the natural father's spouse. The court rejected appellant's alternative claim that section 503 was unconstitutional, holding it did not discriminate against unmarried persons who wished to adopt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's adoption petition. A qualified consent to adoption was only sufficient under the Adoption Act in the case of an adoption by the spouse of a natural parent and here appellant was not the spouse of the natural father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested and convicted of a second offense while on parole for a previous offense. After a parole violation hearing, appellee Parole Board recommitted appellant for the balance of his original sentence, without giving him credit for the time he spent on parole. Appellant alleged that this was an illegal enhancement of his sentence because its order by the executive branch of government violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The court held that allowing appellant to have the benefit of &quot;street time&quot; during which he ignored the conditions of his parole would render parole ineffective as a corrective device, and this was not an enhancement of his sentence. The court found that the decision of the Parole Board to deny credit for &quot;street time&quot; was in accord with the constitutional provisions of 61 P.S. &sect; 331.21a, and it dismissed appellant's complaint.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the proper disposition was to apply &sect; 28 in such a way as to read it as providing for reciprocity of remedies for spouses. The court reversed the order dismissing appellant's counterclaim, concluding that a finding of unconstitutionality was an alternative no longer available by virtue of 1 Pa. Cons.
