Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-20 simultaneously waived any future right of appellant spouse to assert a statutory claim for dependency benefits upon worker's death. The court determined that a spouse must knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive the right to future dependency claims in all future &sect; 20 settlements which contemplated the employee's death as result of conditions encompassed by the employee's compensation claim. The court reversed the lower court's decision that affirmed the New Jersey Division of Workers' Compensation's holding that the worker's waiver of his spouse's dependency claim was binding on appellant and remanded to the Division of Workers' Compensation, concluding that although the ruling would apply only prospectively, appellant should receive the benefit of having successfully litigated the claim upon which the new rule of law was based.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, collectively the Boy Scouts, sought review of a decision of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which held that the Law Against Discrimination, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an assistant scoutmaster, was expelled solely because of the Boy Scouts' policy of excluding avowed homosexuals from membership. He filed suit under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 to -49. Defendants appealed, claiming that the LAD violated their First Amendment rights and that they were exempt from the LAD. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-5l, neither the distinctly private exception, the religious educational facility exception, nor the in loco parentis exception to the LAD applied to defendants. Because plaintiff's scoutmaster position was a privilege of membership, and because defendants revoked plaintiff's membership based on his avowed homosexuality, defendants violated the LAD. Finally, the court found that the LAD did not violate defendants' First Amendment rights, because plaintiff's presence in the organization was not tantamount to defendants' endorsement of homosexuality.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the purpose of the amendments was to stimulate investment by licensees in Atlantic City. The parking fees authorized by the amendment constituted state revenue but that revenue was not revenue derived from the operation of gambling establishments nor were they the type of casino-related revenue that the legislature intended to be dedicated to eligible senior and disabled citizens.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating plaintiff's sign ordinance. The court held that defendant's interior illuminated transparencies were devices used for visual communication, display, identification and publicity for the purpose of communicating the message that beautiful girls were inside. The court, employing the four-part test pronounced in Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp. v. New York Public Service Commission, held that the ordinance did not restrict speech based on its content and that its regulatory restrictions examined under standards of intermediate scrutiny applicable to commercial speech were not an unconstitutional limitation of defendant's speech. Procedural due process was satisfied by the prompt judicial review accorded by a defendant's right to appeal. The ordinance was not facially vague because the defendant presented insufficient evidence of disparate treatment, and although the amount of the fine for violation of the sign ordinance was large, it was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed because the ordinance applied to defendant's interior displays, its restrictions were not an unconstitutional limitation of defendant's speech, satisfied due process, and though the fine was large it was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the denial of defendant-respondent's petition for post-conviction relief, the court held defendant-respondent's counsel was not ineffective for (1) failing to submit certain mitigating evidence because the evidence had limited mitigating value and possessed potential harm, and the defendant-respondent did not want it disclosed, (2) defendant-respondent did not suffer a manifest injustice by the failure to present the evidence, and the (3) failure to present evidence of burn screens would not have substantially affected the jury's deliberations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two months after defendant's direct appeal was completed, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that the determination of the element of materiality in the crime of perjury must be submitted to the jury. The court held that it would not retroactively apply the new rule to defendant's collateral attack of his perjury conviction. The court, reviewing a three-pronged retroactivity test, determined that the purpose of the new rule would not be advanced by retroactivity, that the prior rule did not substantially impair the truth-finding process, and the impact of retroactive application of the new rule of law on the administration of justice would be too severe. The court reached the same conclusion by applying the federal retroactivity test. The procedure employed in defendant's trial for perjury was far different from the kind of absolute prerequisite to the fundamental fairness that was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed holding that defendant was not permitted to collaterally attack his prior judgment of conviction for perjury by retroactively applying the new rule that the element of materiality in the crime of perjury must be submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentencing, arguing that the provision of the hate crime law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-3(e), which allowed judge to enhance sentence if he found biased purpose, was unconstitutional because it should have been jury who found that biased purpose existed beyond reasonable doubt. The court examined whether the given portion of the statute constituted an element of an offense and found it instead to be sentencing provision. Thus, the factual determination could be made by the sentencer. The court also found the provision was narrowly tailored to meet First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend I, concerns. A finding of a biased motive or purpose to intimidate was a very traditional sentencing factor. The claim that the statute conflicted with a constitutional right was far from clear beyond a reasonable doubt. The statute did not punish thought but did punish more severely crimes involving particularly vulnerable victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because biased purpose was a sentencing provision that could be determined by the sentencer; the enhancement was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the sexual assault of a mentally defective person. Defendant attempted to introduce evidence of the victim's past sexual experiences through the cross-examination of plaintiff's expert psychologist. According to defendant, the purpose of that evidence was to demonstrate that the victim had the capacity to consent to sexual relations despite her mental condition. The court held that only in situations where the relevance and probative worth of prior sexual experience were clear and substantial should the Rape Shield Law bend to the confrontation right of defendant. That was not the case here and any further probative value in admitting evidence of the victim's past sexual experience was clearly outweighed by its prejudicial effect and capacity to confuse; judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for the killing of a six-year old girl. At the penalty phase, the jury determined that aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and sentenced defendant to death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, the court granted defendant's request for proportionality review and affirmed the sentence. In applying the salient-factors test, the court concluded that defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to other defendants who sexually assaulted and murdered their victims. Further, the application of the index-of-outcomes test did not demonstrate that defendant's sentence was disproportionate. The diminished reliability of the index-of-outcomes test, however, required the court to give enhanced weight to the process of precedent-seeking review. Under the precedent-seeking review test, the court concluded that defendant's culpability was quite substantial, the degree of victimization was extreme, and his moral blameworthiness was very high. Thus, in comparing defendant to defendants who committed similar crimes, the court found that the sentence was not aberrational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court judgment that found that the special assessments that defendant municipality imposed upon plaintiff businesses pursuant to state law was not a violation of the New Jersey Constitution simply because residential properties were excluded from the assessment. The requirement that all property taxes be assessed according to the same standard of value did not apply, because the assessment was not a real property tax and was designed to benefit particular properties. The statute in question was designed to better commercial properties and promote economic growth in the business community. The assessments were not clearly out of proportion to the benefits from them, and were presumed to be correct. The exclusion of residential properties did not constitute an invalid exemption under N.J. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court's affirmance of defendant's murder conviction and capital sentence, defendant requested a proportionality review of his sentence pursuant to N.J.

In conducting the proportionality review, the court first considered the constitutionality of a recent amendment to N.J. Stat.

The court appointed a special master to further review the constitutionality issue. In its initial review of the amendment, however, the court abandoned that portion of its proportionality review analysis focusing on the numerical preponderance of aggravating and mitigating factors test. Concerning the review of defendant's sentence, the court affirmed, finding that defendant had not met his burden of proving that his death sentence was disproportionate or that race operated as an impermissible factor in the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving the validity of governmental regulations that effectively barred an adult book store from operating in a certain township, the court granted certification to the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), for purposes of resolving the issue as to which party bore the burden of proving the availability of sites for sexually oriented businesses within reasonable proximity to petitioner's site in the township.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner operated an adult bookstore contrary to a township's ordinances. The township sued to enjoin the violation of its ordinances, and later alleged that petitioner's business violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:34-7, which prohibited the operation of a sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of certain religious and public places. The trial court concluded that &sect; 2C:34-7 was unconstitutional because there was no area within the township that did not fall within the 1,000 foot barrier. The appellate court rejected that holding and remanded the matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on the availability of sites outside the township for sexually oriented businesses that were close to a then-existing site. The burden of proving the availability of such sites was placed on the township. Upon certification, the court affirmed that allocation of the burden of proof in recognition of the fairness of imposing on the public body that sought to restrict protected speech the obligation of showing that its restrictions 1) were reasonably tailored to achieve its objectives, 2) were not more intrusive than necessary, and 3) provided adequate alternative means of communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certification, the court affirmed the appellate court's allocation of the burden of proof upon a township for ascertaining the availability of sites outside the township's boundaries for sexually oriented businesses, within a close proximity to petitioner's existing site. The court ruled as such in recognition of the fairness of imposing such an obligation on a public body to show that its restrictions upon speech were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed an order from the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), affirming denial of defendants' motions to suppress evidence obtained from police officers' search of a state driver's license bureau's computer records. Defendants claimed random police use of the records through license plate checks violated their privacy rights under N.J. Const. art. 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In unrelated incidents, police used defendant drivers' vehicle license plate information to obtain computerized vehicle registration and license information. Upon learning defendants' driver's licenses were suspended, the police stopped defendants and issued citations. Both defendants brought motions to suppress the evidence obtained from the computer searches. The trial court denied suppression, and the appellate court affirmed. Defendants appealed, claiming they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the records. The court affirmed, holding that, where the license plate information was openly displayed and a state statute authorized use of the information for law enforcement purposes, no privacy rights were implicated. Thus, defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy in vehicle registration and license information where N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:2-3.4(c)(1) authorized the use of license plate information for law enforcement purposes.. The court suggested a two-tier process for accessing such information, with personal information being searchable only upon a finding that the car was unregistered or stolen or that the driver was in violation of licensing laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of murder and imposed a sentence of death. Defendant appealed, arguing that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court failed to take strong measures to assure that his trial was free from the outside influence of prejudicial publicity. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that the measures taken by the trial court ensured that defendant's trial was free of extraneous influences. Although the trial court agreed with defendant that there was a realistic likelihood of prejudice from prejudicial trial publicity but did not grant a change of venue, the court found no error in the trial court's decision to empanel a foreign jury rather than to transfer venue. Further, the trial court's use of searching voir dire examinations and the impaneling of the out-of-county jury were trial management techniques that were specifically approved to ensure the right to an impartial jury. The court, however, noted that in future capital cases a trial court was required to change venue when there was a realistic likelihood of the continuation of presumptively prejudicial publicity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his murder conviction and death sentence from the Superior Court, Law Division, Gloucester County (New Jersey), arguing that the trial court's rigid sequencing of the charge and deliberations improperly coerced the jury into reaching a death-eligible verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of purposeful-or-knowing murder by his own conduct and imposed a penalty of death. On his appeal as of right, defendant challenged the trial court's sequential presentation of own-conduct and accomplice liability murder and an admonition that the jury reach the accomplice liability question only after acquitting on own-conduct murder. The court affirmed the decision. Accomplice liability was an alternative rather than a lesser-included form of murder. Further, where there was a rational basis for the jury to convict on the non-death-eligible alternative of accomplice liability, the trial court was required to charge the offense in a manner allowing simultaneous consideration of it with the death eligible purposeful-or-knowing murder. Thus, the charge that the jury did not have to consider accomplice liability unless it first acquitted of own-conduct murder was error. Under the circumstances of the case, however, the charge was not plain error possessing the clear capacity to bring about an unjust result because the jury's finding that defendant was the shooter reflected a consideration and rejection of accomplice liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction and sentence of death. Although the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it did not have to consider accomplice liability unless it first acquitted of own-conduct murder, the error was harmless under the circumstances of the case because the non-death-eligible option of accomplice liability was considered and rejected by the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a death sentence imposed by the Superior Court, Law Division, Camden County (New Jersey), following the defendant's convictions for two counts of capital murder and one count of second-degree aggravated assault based upon the defendant's pleas of guilty to all three counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the execution of a search warrant by police officers, the defendant shot two police officers and seriously wounded another officer. The defendant pled guilty to two counts of capital murder and one count of second-degree aggravated assault. As a result, the trial court convicted the defendant on all three counts. The defendant received a sentence of death. On review, the court vacated the death sentence, because the prosecution failed to disclose information regarding a civil suit filed the police officer who survived the shoot-out. In the civil action, the police officer alleged that he was provided with inadequate training to serve a search warrant on the defendant, an individual with a history of severe mental health concerns. The court explained that information about the officer's civil action would have supported the &quot;catch-all&quot; mitigating factor advanced by the defendant. The court concluded that the prosecution violated the Brady rule by its failure to provide evidence, which was favorable to the defense and material to the jury's determination as to whether the defendant deserved the death penalty.

The appellate division reversed, finding that the statute targeted only commercial speech, which was not subject to strict scrutiny. The court affirmed the appellate court decision, concluding that because the statute only applied to commercial speech, an intermediate level of scrutiny was required, and using such a level of scrutiny, the state met its required burden of demonstrating that the statute advanced a legitimate state interest and was narrowly tailored to serve that interest.

The lower court found that the owner was entitled to a jury trial and that the forfeiture provision was unconstitutional. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed, finding that historically, cases involving the forfeiture of innocent property generally resulted in a trial by jury. The court found that actions to forfeit automobiles should be treated similarly as actions to forfeit other kinds of innocent property, such as ships, which always were subject to trial by jury. The inconvenience to the state when it sought to forfeit innocent property was not a justification for the denial of a constitutional right to a jury trial of N.J. Const. art 1, para. 9.</SPAN></P>

The court found CEIFA to be unconstitutional as applied to the special needs districts because it failed to guarantee sufficient funds to enable students to achieve the requisite academic standards. The court remanded the case to a lower court. The lower court was authorized to direct the commissioner of the department of education to initiate a study and to prepare a report with specific findings and recommendations covering the special needs issues. The court considered and adopted numerous recommendations including that the state require the districts in question to adopt some version of &quot;whole school design&quot; because it found whole school reform to be a remedial measure that could create the opportunity to achieve a thorough and efficient education. The court affirmed the lower court's recommendation that full day kindergarten be implemented in all affected schools.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the parole board denied the appellant parole and deferred his future parole eligibility for 10 years. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the parole board's decision. On review, the court set aside the portion of the intermediate appellate court's decision, insofar as it sustained the board's final decision denying the appellant parole and fixing an extended future parole eligibility date. The court explained that the parole board's ultimate determination of parole fitness must be based on whether there was a likelihood that the appellant would again engage in criminal activity. The court found that it was unclear whether the parole board's findings of fact were adequately tailored to the correct test and whether the underlying evidence was sufficient to support a determination conforming to that test. The court remanded the case to the intermediate appellate court with instructions that the intermediate appellate court direct the board to redetermine appellant's parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the purpose of the parole revocation proceeding was not punitive, the fact that defendant faced what could be viewed as multiple sanctions as a result of the same, or substantially the same, conduct did not violate the constitutional protections against double jeopardy. The court held that the imposition of both sanctions was not fundamentally unfair, and thus declined to apply the doctrine of fundamental fairness to prohibit what the constitutional protections against double jeopardy did not.</SPAN></P>

The evidence at trial showed that, although his job evaluations had always been positive, plaintiff was fired after he expressed objections to the sales in Japan of gasoline containing more than five percent benzene, which scientific evidence showed to be hazardous to humans. The jury found for plaintiff, but the trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict for defendants. The appellate division reversed and reinstated the jury verdict. Defendants appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that evidence of a Japanese regulatory prohibition on sales of high-benzene gasoline supported the finding that plaintiff's discharge was contrary to a clear mandate of public policy, which was a question of law under CEPA. Moreover, the extraterritorial application of CEPA was not an unconstitutional regulation of foreign commerce and did not render CEPA vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellee's regulation prohibiting unbecoming conduct was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because the regulation was clearly aimed at conduct, rather than speech, and implicitly excluded constitutionally-protected conduct. Appellant's racial slur was not protected by the free speech clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father, while under investigation for child abuse by child protective services, and possibly subject to criminal prosecution for the same abusive behavior, admitted to his caseworker that he had shaken and injured his infant. The trial court ruled that his inculpatory statement was inadmissible in his criminal trial and the lower appellate court affirmed. On appeal the court reversed, establishing that respondent was not in custody when he was questioned by his caseworker. Rather, the circumstances surrounding his interview failed to demonstrate a coercive atmosphere as respondent was interviewed at home, during the day, with his father nearby. The court explained that although respondent was free to remain silent and to insist upon his lawyer's presence, the caseworker was not required to stop the interview when respondent stated that he had been advised not to discuss the matter. The reference to his attorney did not, in this setting, invoke his right to remain silent such that the caseworker was required to end the interview. Further, the court found, respondent was not illegally asked to choose between his children and the exercise of his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment affirming the order of the trial court suppressing respondent father's inculpatory statement was reversed because respondent's statement was not constitutionally protected where his interview by a child protective services caseworker was noncustodial and noncoercive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant were charged with and pled guilty to juvenile delinquency for sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl. The state moved, at the victim's request, for orders compelling appellants to submit to AIDS testing. Appellants contended that the statutes mandating serological testing were unconstitutional because they impinged upon their due process and search and seizure rights. The trial court found that the tests constituted a search within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV and that the statutes at issue were unconstitutional. The lower appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that such testing and disclosure of an assailant's AIDS status could provide information that was helpful to victims of sexual assault. Because the dissemination of test results was carefully restricted by statute, the court found that it was reasonable to require assailants to submit to this intrusion upon their privacy. However, the court modified the judgment by requiring that before testing could be ordered, the lower court must find probable cause to believe that the victim had been exposed to a risk that transmission of the AIDS virus may have occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order reversing the finding that state's statutes mandating AIDS testing for perpetrators of sexual assault was unconstitutional was affirmed because such testing was beneficial to victims; however, the order was modified to ensure that the lower courts only mandate testing where there was probable cause to believe that the victim had been exposed to a risk of AIDS transmission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transit union local sought certified review of a decision from the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), granting defendant state transit agency summary judgment as to plaintiff's claim that defendant's mandatory random drug testing policy violated the right of plaintiff's members, transit police officers, to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures under N. J. Constitution art. 1, para. 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transit union local challenged the appellate court's decision granting summary judgment to defendant state transit agency as to plaintiff's constitutional challenge to defendant's new mandatory random drug testing policy. Defendant adopted the new policy to comply with federal regulations passed pursuant to the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5331(b), requiring testing of employees such as plaintiff's members, transit police officers, that were responsible for safety-sensitive functions. On appeal, the state's highest court held that random drug testing did not violate the state or federal constitutions. As employees of a highly regulated industry, plaintiff's members were subject to suspicionless drug testing. Although requiring urine samples was the equivalent of conducting warrantless searches, defendant's random drug testing policy was carefully drawn to protect plaintiff's members' privacy rights. The test results were kept confidential. The government had a compelling state interest in insuring that armed transit officers posed no safety threat to the public. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant had not been denied a fair trial, and that the jury venire had been properly conducted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lay teachers in appellant church-operated elementary school sought to organize and engage in collective bargaining through respondent labor organization with respect to the secular terms and conditions of their employment. The trial court refused to compel appellant to bargain with respondent citing the Free Exercise and Establishment clauses of U.S. Const. amend. I. The lower appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed and remanded for a representational election, holding that the lay teachers had a constitutional right to unionize and to engage in collective bargaining. The scope of the negotiations, however, was limited by the Religion Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. I to secular terms or conditions of employment. Such activity, the court held, would not inhibit appellant's religion by interfering with issues of structure and indoctrination. By limiting the scope of collective bargaining to secular issues, the court explained, religion was neither advanced nor inhibited.

Thereafter, the police gave defendant his Miranda rights, and defendant subsequently made incriminating statements. Defendant was convicted of murder, and the jury sentenced him to death. The jury found applicable the aggravated factor under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3(c)(4)(d) based on defendant's receipt of life insurance proceeds. Defendant challenged his conviction, and the court held that after defendant had invoked his right to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel, he voluntarily initiated further conversation with police and waived the privilege against self-incrimination. The court also determined that the trial court correctly denied a jury instruction on murder as an accomplice, because the evidence did not support it. Finally, the court concluded that the aggravating factor was properly applied to the insurance proceeds defendant received on the victim's life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed a ruling that found appellee, a divorcee, violated the harassment statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-4(a), and a final domestic violence restraining order when he mailed, on two occasions, a torn-up support order to his former spouse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state argued that mailings by appellee of a torn-up support order to his former spouse violated the harassment statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-4(a). The court disagreed, ruling that the manner of communication did not establish the requisite harassing intent to annoy or alarm. While evidence showed that appellee's purpose was to harass, as mailings had no legitimate purpose, his manner was not likely to cause alarm. In so ruling, the court declined to view the statute as constitutionally vague for failing to define the level of objectionable annoyance, because the state of mind the statute required was sufficiently clear. However, the provision was construed to encompass only those methods of communication that were invasive of the recipient's privacy. Nonintrusive speech did not lose its constitutional protection even if annoying, the court added, noting that the mailings did not include offensive language, occurred during convenient hours, and were in appellee's own name. Conversely, appellee did violate the contempt statute,&nbsp;&sect; 2C:25-29(b), by making mailings that contravened his restraining order, as the order effectively barred any contact between former spouses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed that appellee did not violate harassment statute by mailing torn-up support order to former spouse, because the mailing, while harassing in intent, did not invade the spouse's privacy, as it occurred during convenient hours and was in appellee's name, but judgment that appellee did not violate domestic violence restraining order by making the mailing reversed, as order effectively barred any contact between former spouses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of several offenses related to burglary of a home, having pleaded both the insanity defense and diminished capacity. On appeal, defendant contended that the jury instructions regarding the insanity defense impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. In those instructions, the trial court directed that the jury consider the insanity defense after having determined defendant's guilt of the offenses. Defendant claimed that the jury was prevented from considering evidence of insanity when determining whether defendant had the requisite mental state to be guilty of the offenses. The appellate court reversed appellant's conviction and the state appealed. The court held that while the instructions could have been improved with regard to whether evidence of insanity could be applied to the issue of defendant's mental state, they did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof of innocence. The instructions, in their entirety, stressed the burden upon the state of proving guilt. The court reversed the appellate court judgment, and reinstated defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

A collective bargaining agreement was then reached that provided for a retroactive pay increase. Plaintiffs, troopers that had resigned during the negotiations, sought the increase. The appellate court found in favor of plaintiffs. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent teacher possessed an administrative certificate with separate principal and supervisor endorsements, but had never served in the capacity of principal. After respondent was overlooked for a principal position, he filed a challenge claiming tenure rights to the position. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) granted summary judgment to respondent and ordered that he be given the principal position. The state commissioner of education reversed the ALJ's position and held that respondent had no tenure claim to the principal position pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:28-5. Appellant township board of education adopted the commissioner's decision and the superior court then reversed. Upon the petitions for certification of appellant and the state board of education, the court reversed the superior court's judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and given the death penalty. On direct appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief (PCR). The trial court denied defendant's PCR application and defendant appealed. On appeal, the court held that post-conviction relief proceedings were not a substitute for direct appeal. Moreover, the court rejected defendant's claims that the prosecution improperly withheld exculpatory evidence from defendant. The court held that there was no reasonable possibility that a different verdict would have arisen had the evidence been disclosed. Further, the court rejected defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court reasoned that few of the allegations of ineffective assistance at trial involved significant deficiencies in the quality of his counsel's representation, and those that did were not material to the trial result. The court affirmed the trial court's decision not to order the prosecution to allow him to inspect the prosecution's entire file.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General petitioned for certification from a decision of the Superior Court (New Jersey) challenging the breadth of the decision in permitting expert testimony and leniency in overriding of the Registrant Risk Assessment Scale score of registrant sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Registrant was convicted of sexual assault and upon his release was subject to the sex offender registration system pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-1 to -5. Notification of registrant's release was to be circulated to all schools within a two-mile radius of registrant's home under N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:7-6 to -11. Registrant challenged the ranking of a &quot;Tier 2&quot; offender determined by the Registrant Risk Assessment Scale (Scale) that resulted in the notification requirement. The trial court denied registrant's request to present expert testimony regarding his tier level. The appellate court reversed and concluded that registrant should be permitted to present expert testimony at the hearing to show that variable factors considered in the Scale calculations, as related to him, should have resulted in a lesser tier classification. On certification of that decision to the supreme court, the court found that a psychiatric expert could potentially have established important factors not adequately addressed by the Scale, and that a statistical expert could have potentially strengthened the psychiatric expert's testimony. Thus, the decision of the appellate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Factors not considered or not sufficiently considered by a set scale used to make the tier determination could have been established through expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two causes were appealed from the Superior Court (New Jersey) by plaintiff-appellant corporation seeking to dismiss an appeal and by defendant-appellant dissenting shareholders to establish a fair determination of their share-value rights as well as actions by minority shareholders seeking special injury claims against more senior respondent shareholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff-appellant corporation transferred all of its assets to wholly-owned subsidiaries. Defendant-appellant shareholders dissented and sought appraisal rights based upon that transfer. Plaintiff-appellant subsequently sought to rescind its action and contended that doing so would defeat appraisal rights. These actions as well as an action against defendant-respondent shareholders that defendant-respondent's were impeding the company's growth were consolidated on appeal to the supreme court. The supreme court found that plaintiff-appellant's attempted rescission of its action was delayed too long to be actionable without causing harm to defendant appellant shareholders. Plaintiff-appellant's motion to dismiss its appeal and defendant-appellant's request to affirm rulings below each would result in appraisal proceedings. Therefore, the rescission motion ruling and the retroactivity motion were affirmed. Actions by defendant-respondent shareholders impacted all shareholders similarly and did not, therefore, present a claim of special injury for individual shareholders. Therefore these claims as well as a federal Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations claim were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders denying plaintiff-appellant corporation's motions to dismiss an appraisal action were affirmed and the order was remanded for further proceedings. Defendant-appellants dissenting shareholders' actions for determination of share-value rights was granted. Judgments regarding special injury and RICO violations were appropriately dismissed, as they were subject to derivative and not individual actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his murder conviction. At the penalty-phase hearing, a separately empanelled jury returned a death-penalty verdict. The trial court denied defendant's pretrial motions including a motion to strike aggravating factor N.J.

The supreme court affirmed defendant's murder and related offenses convictions and his sentence of death. Death-penalty statute did not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment contained in U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Defense counsel's strategic decision did not provide grounds for a finding of plain error. Trial court was correct in refusing to allow cross-examination about other perpetrators. Trial court's failure to provide instruction did not disturb defendant's conviction or sentence. The supreme court had carefully reviewed the errors identified in the course of the opinion. It was satisfied, in the context of a trial that produced overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, that the combined effect of those errors was not clearly capable of affecting either defendant's convictions or his sentences.</SPAN></P>

At the second penalty trial, defendant was again sentenced to death. The court reversed and remanded for a new penalty phase, holding that juror misconduct during jury deliberations exposed the jury to extraneous influences. The court held that the introduction of victim impact information into the jury's deliberation had the clear capacity to prejudice defendant. The court held that the lower court abused its discretion in denying defendant's application for a mistrial. The court rejected defendant's claim that the New Jersey Death Penalty Act violated the U.S. Const. amend. VII. The court held that the trial court improperly expanded the scope of N.J. R. Crim. P. 1:8-2(d)'s inability-to-continue standard when it removed a juror from the deliberating jury. The court held that although the juror violated the oath by informing other jurors that the victim had children, the misconduct did not fall within the scope of the inability-to-continue standard.</SPAN></P>

The rule under which appellant was committed, provided that a minor could be involuntarily committed if the court found that the minor was in need of therapy that could not be provided anywhere but in a psychiatric hospital. The court reversed the judgment, holding that a standard that would authorize the involuntary commitment of a minor under fourteen years of age must first require a showing that the minor was mentally ill, as defined in terms of childhood mental illness.

Defendant was convicted and sentenced for maintaining or operating a controlled dangerous substance production facility under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-4 and related offenses. The appellate court affirmed the convictions, but ordered merger and found the sentence excessive. Defendant sought review. The court affirmed. The court stated that based on the plain language of &sect; 2C:35-4, defendant's conduct fell within its purview, and that &sect; 2C:35-4 was neither vague nor applicable only to &quot;commercial&quot; manufacturing facilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for several crimes, including capital murder, after he attacked a little girl. The state served notice of four aggravating factors. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3c(6), the victim impact statute under both the New Jersey and United States Constitutions. The trial court granted defendant's motion and declared the statute unconstitutional under both constitutions. The trial court, however, declined to reach the question of whether the New Jersey Constitution prohibited the use of victim impact evidence. The court rejected defendant's argument that the application of victim impact statute to him would violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state and federal constitutions. On state's motion for clarification, the court found that the victim impact statute did not violate the federal or state constitution because it provided sufficient procedural safeguards for defendants. The court also found that applying the statute to defendant would not violate either ex post facto clause. The court reversed the trial court and allowed the introduction of victim impact evidence at the penalty stage of defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After kidnapping and killing a victim, defendant was convicted of, among other offenses, purposeful and knowing murder and was sentenced him to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed. Thereafter, appellant public defender appointed to represent defendant, applied for permission to pursue post-conviction relief on defendant's behalf over his objection, or for an evidentiary hearing on his competency, as well as for a stay of execution pending post-conviction relief proceedings. The trial court appointed independent counsel for him and a psychiatrist to determine his competence to waive post-conviction proceedings. After a hearing, the trial court ruled that defendant was competent to waive post-conviction proceedings, and that appellant could not seek post-conviction relief over defendant's objection. The supreme court reversed and held that even though it was satisfied that defendant was competent to make the decision to prosecute no further appeals, the supreme court had a constitutional responsibility to ensure reliability in the implementation of the death penalty. As such, the supreme court outlined an abbreviated post-conviction relief process and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff salesperson petitioned for certification of a judgment from the lower court. The lower court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of defendant real estate firm, its employee, and a real estate developer, the dismissal of plaintiff's claims relating to both wrongful discharge and tortious interference, and the dismissal of plaintiff's libel count with prejudice. The supreme court granted the petition for certification and reversed the summary judgment in favor of defendants because there were material issues of facts about the working relationship between the parties that were unresolved. The supreme court stated that the issue existed of whether defendant real estate firm's conduct in terminating plaintiff's employment was based on interests or relationships that would have constituted an impermissible conflict of interest and may have offended the standards that governed conflicts of interest, thereby violating a clear mandate of public policy.

The trial court denied petitioner's request for a workers' compensation award because petitioner was receiving a disability retirement pension.

The court reversed the appellate court's ruling and held that petitioner was barred from receiving compensation for his work injury under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-43. The court concluded that the legislative intent was that workers' compensation benefits that were afforded to respondent's employees were required to be integrated with the disability retirement benefits afforded to public employees for the same injury.

The court reversed in part reinstating the claims against defendants school board and city, public defendants, had caused a continuing nuisance on plaintiffs' land, which was not time barred due to its continuing nature.

The trial court denied defendant's motion for severance, even after defendant claimed that his brother would provide exculpatory testimony if the two were tried separately. Defendant and his brother were both convicted of the crimes charged. The lower court reversed defendant's conviction holding that severance was warranted because there was a substantial likelihood that exculpatory evidence would have been offered. The state appealed. The court determined that discrepancies in brothers' stories undermined the exculpatory value of the proffered testimony and supported the trial court's suspicion that the brothers were attempting to use the severance motion as a ploy to get one of them acquitted. Furthermore, the court concluded that because defendant failed to show that substantially exculpatory testimony would have been forthcoming had his severance motion been granted, he did not demonstrate prejudice sufficient to compel severance under N.J. Ct. R. 3: 15-2(b). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Burlington County (New Jersey), which held that two of the statutes generally referred to as Megan's Law, the Registration Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-1 to :7-5 and the Community Notification Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-6 to :7-11, were constitutional, and the court granted certification to the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the constitutionality of two statutes concerning sex offenders that were enacted as part of a group of laws generally referred to as Megan's Law. The Registration Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-1 to :7-5, required that certain convicted sex offenders register with law enforcement authorities. The Community Notification Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:7-6 to :7-11, provided for notice to the community of the presence of such offenders. In ruling that both laws were constitutional, the court held that the constitution did not prevent society from attempting to protect itself from convicted sex offenders, so long as the means of protection were reasonably designed for that purpose, and only for that purpose, and were not designed to punish. The court found, however, that appellant had a protectable liberty interest in his privacy and reputation, which triggered the right to due process. The court, therefore, concluded that a judicial hearing was constitutionally mandated prior to community notification under the Community Notification Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that both the Registration Law and the Community Notification Law were constitutional, but that the prosecutor's decision to provide community notification, which included the manner of notification, was subject to judicial review before such notification was given, and that such review was constitutionally required.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed and remanded for a complete consideration of the application, not to be limited by the contingent fee agreement. On certification, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court, and reasoned that the reasonable fee award authorized by statute should not have been limited to the amount payable under the contingent fee agreement, nor should it have been proportionate to the damages recovered in the litigation. The court ruled that to so limit the fee award would dampen attorneys' enthusiasm for the vindication of civil rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and other felony offenses that were committed against a husband, wife, and daughters. Defendant was sentenced by the jury to death. Defendant appealed the convictions and sentence, and the court affirmed. The court held that the jury was properly instructed on the state's burden to prove murder, the requirement of a unanimous jury verdict, and defendant's evidence of mental illness and diminished capacity. No error was found in the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that defendant had a claim of right defense to the robbery charge, and the penalty phase proceedings were not tainted. The court concluded that the jury unanimously found the existence of the felony offenses that served as an aggravating factor in the capital sentence, and the jury was correctly instructed on mitigating factors. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in the prosecutor's decision to seek the death penalty after initially offering defendant a plea of a life sentence. The trial court did not err when it refused to dismiss for cause two jurors based on the jurors' expressed views on the death penalty and the use of psychiatric testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of numerous burglary, murder, assault, and weapons possession charges after he broke into an apartment where his former girlfriend was living, killed the former girlfriend's roommate, and assaulted the former girlfriend, her sister, and her sister's boyfriend. On direct appeal, defendant challenged the jury charge on voluntary intoxication, and the intermediate court found no error and affirmed the conviction. On his motion for post-conviction relief, defendant challenged the diminished capacity charge and alleged ineffective assistance. The trial court denied relief, but the intermediate court reversed and granted a new trial. The court granted plaintiff's petition for certification and reversed. The court found that the trial court's diminished capacity charge reflected the controlling law at the time and emphasized plaintiff's burden to prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the law changed after defendant's trial and lessened the burden on defendants, any error in the charge was harmless because defendant was not entitled to it. Any error in the charge's failure to comport with the new standard was also harmless absent supporting evidence.</SPAN></P>

Any error in the trial court's diminished capacity charge was harmless because defendant was not entitled to such a charge under the old law, and evidence did not support the requisite standard under the new law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Resolution Trust Corporation, in its capacity as receiver, filed a complaint for foreclosure, and appellee sheriff conducted the sale. Appellant was the successful bidder, and appellee assessed a fee pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A:4-8. The trial court found for appellee, and stated that the fee was not a tax and appellant was not exempt. The appellate court affirmed for the same reasons. On appeal, the court reversed and found for appellant. The court held that congress specifically exempted appellant from state and local taxation in respect to its acquisition of assets from failed thrift institutions. Pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, 12 U.S.C.S.&sect; 1441a(b)(4), appellant was authorized to exercise all of the powers conferred on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1821, 1822, 1823. The court held that appellant was exempt from state and local taxation to the same extent as the FDIC pursuant to 12 U.S.C.S.&sect; 1825(b), and because the fee in question far exceeded the cost to appellee it was, therefore, a tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment for appellant Resolution Trust Corporation, and held that because congress had specifically exempted appellant from state and local taxation in respect to its acquisition of assets from failed thrift institutions the charge to have been imposed by appellee sheriff was essentially equivalent to a tax measured by the sale price of the foreclosed property and was, therefore, unlawfully imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer had received an agricultural exemption on his property for five years.

Appellant sought to correct the mistake under the Correction of Errors Statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:51A-7 (the statute). The court, on appeal, affirmed the lower court's judgment and found that such an error was not correctable under the statute and that only mistakes that were indispensable and that could not plausibly be explained on the basis of tax assessor judgment or discretion were within the category of mistakes covered by the statute. The court further found that the correct assessment under the statute must have been readily inferable or have been subject to ready calculation on the basis on the assessment mistake and that appellant was not guaranteed that his property would again qualify as farmland, but merely wanted his property assessed and such did not fall within the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped a businessman and, after being paid $ 25,000 in ransom by the man's wife, defendant shot the man at close range and killed him. Defendant was subsequently found guilty by a jury of purposeful or knowing murder by his own conduct, felony murder, kidnapping and two weapons offenses and was sentenced to death, as well as other consecutive and concurrent sentences. Defendant alleged disproportionality of his death sentence and, on appeal, the court affirmed and held that there was no disproportionality in the death sentence. The court utilized the offender-oriented proportionality review which included frequency analysis and precedent-seeking review and found that defendant's case was reviewable in a universe of cases comprised of stranger kidnapping, contract and pecuniary-advantage killer cases in which the death penalty was sought. A high likelihood existed that the death penalty would be imposed for the type of murder that defendant committed because the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating factors considered by the jury. Defendant failed in his burden to show an aberration in the result of or the presence of impermissible factors in the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no such right protected by U.S. Const. amend.

The public nature of regional shopping centers and their usurpation of the downtown business district were factors the court relied upon in its decision.

The court, which found that the 300-foot restriction burdened more speech than was necessary and did not meet the mandates of a previous United States Supreme Court decision, reduced the distance to 100-feet. The court found that the injunction was not a pre-publication prior restraint or the result of a discriminatory licensing or regulatory system and did not forbid appellants from expressing their opinion or restrict appellant's activities merely because of the position that their message adopted. The court found that even if the injunction was a prior restraint, respondents were a captive audience with protectable privacy interests in their home and therefore public interest required protection of them as unwilling listeners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified and affirmed the permanent injunction against appellant protestors, and prohibited any picketing within 100 feet of respondents', doctor and wife, residence, limited the size of the protestors to no more than 10 people for one hour every two weeks, and ordered appellant's to notify the local police in advance of any intended picketing, because respondents had a substantial, protectable privacy interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the school paper was not a public forum, but that appellants had not established a legitimate educational policy regarding publication of reviews of R-rated movies, and the reviews in dispute were merely brief descriptions with terse recommendations. Because appellants failed to establish legitimate pedagogical concerns regarding publication of the reviews, respondent's free expression rights were violated.

One defendant obtained heroin for her friend and his brother. Defendant's friend died after injection of the heroin. The other defendant was convicted when two individuals died after they swallowed cocaine distributed by defendant, to avoid detection by the police. On appeal, the court affirmed because the state had the authority to define a crime without proof of mens rea so long as it had a rational basis. The court held that the control of drug distribution that caused death was a rational basis for the statute. The court held that the statute did not involve cruel and unusual punishment because the punishment fit the crime and did not go beyond what was necessary to accomplish a legitimate objective. The court held &sect; 2C:35-9 did not violate due process and was not vague by using the term &quot;not too remote.&quot; The court held that the remoteness issue should be charged to the jury and its meaning explained and related to the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant plead guilty to murder and was sentenced by the trial judge to death. On defendant's first review the court remanded the case for a new penalty phase hearing and the trial court refused to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea. The jury returned a death-penalty verdict and found that the aggravating factor, murder for hire, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3c(4)(d), outweighed the mitigating factors and the trial court again sentenced defendant to death. On appeal the court affirmed because defendant's guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily made and defendant knew that he could be sentenced to death. Defendant's counsel's erroneous belief that defendant would not be sentenced to death on a guilty plea was not ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that defendant did not show that a juror who was partial sat as a result of defendant's exhaustion of peremptory challenges. The court further held that the trial court should have instructed the jury that defendant's allocution could be considered as a mitigation factor, but the error was harmless. The court held that the trial court's requirement that the jury deliberate further was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court's decision was based on QEA's failure to assure parity of regular education expenditures between the special needs districts and the more affluent districts. The court affirmed the decision, but retained jurisdiction because the state informed the court that it did not anticipate that the QEA would in its present form control financing of public education within the state.

Such policies did not contemplate the use of public-labor agreements by state agencies such as appellee to require contractors of public contracts to hire members of only designated labor organizations at the exclusion of all others. The court found that project-labor agreements requiring the designation of an exclusive labor organization for public construction work contravened N.J. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a proportionality review of a sentence of death from the Monmouth County Superior Court (New Jersey) claiming imposition of the death sentence, when compared to sentences imposed on other defendants in other cases, was irrational or aberrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually assaulted and murdered two women. Separate juries sentenced defendant to death for each of the murders. In the relevant universe of 298 death-eligible cases, 125 of which proceeded to the penalty-trial phase, defendant was the only prior murderer whose death sentence was affirmed. That fact alone did not compel a finding that defendant's death sentence was disproportionate. The cases of other defendants differed significantly from defendant's case. The court concluded the death sentence in defendant's case was not aberrant. As culpable as other defendants with prior murder convictions were, a jury could find defendant, with two convictions for murder and aggravated sexual assault, was particularly deathworthy. The court did not find a pattern of life sentencing or the taint of an invidious factor that would require reversal. The court lacked enough cases to conclude with any degree of statistical reliability whether race was working impermissibly in death sentencing. The court recognized its method of comparison, such as the inclusion of cases in which the death sentence had been reversed, was not perfect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">No disproportionality in the imposition of the death sentence was found. The death sentence imposed on a young African-American man was proportionate. After conducting frequency and precedent seeking approaches to compare other death penalty eligible cases, defendant's death sentence was found neither random nor aberrational. The court did not sense that some invidious factor tainted the appellant's sentencing process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to fourth-degree harassment, a violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-4. He had been charged with having painted on the house of a family of Pakistani descent a scurrilous, offensive allusion that incorporated a reference to the tika, a mark on the forehead of some Hindus. Before sentencing, however, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of a United States Supreme Court's decision, in which the court declared unconstitutional a St. Paul, Minnesota hate-crime ordinance. Defendant argued that the decision rendered the N.J. statute unconstitutional because that statute violated his U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV rights. The trial court agreed with defendant's reading of the supreme court decision and dismissed the charge. On direct certification, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it prohibited conduct, not expressions. The court also concluded that the fact that the crime was motivated by hatred could be used as an enhancement of the crime. The court reversed the order of the trial court and reinstated the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged under New Jersey so-called hate crime statutes,&nbsp;N.J. Stat.

The trial court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment, and the lower court granted leave to appeal. The court granted defendants' motion for direct certification. The court concluded that &sect; 2C:33-10 and &sect; 2C: 33-11 were under-inclusive and thus impermissible. The court found that &sect; 2C:33-10 and &sect; 2C: 33-11 were not narrowly tailored and where other content-neutral alternatives existed, a statute directed at disfavored topics was impermissible. The court determined that inasmuch as the language of &sect; 2C:33-10 and &sect; 2C:33-11 limited their scope to the disfavored topics of race, color, creed, and religion, they offended U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order that denied defendant's motion for a mistrial after the trial court determined that two statements made by defendant were not protected by any privilege. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. Defendant's wife's father found a letter defendant wrote to his wife which contained a description of the murder defendant was charged with. The court held that the marital privilege, N. J. R.

The court held that the clergyman held the priest-penitent privilege, N. J. R. Evid. Rule 37 (now N. J. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tenants rented a single-family for many years, first on a written lease basis then on an oral agreement month-to-month basis. The owner sold the property and the mortgagors financed the purchase in part with a loan from plaintiff mortgagee. The mortgagors subsequently defaulted on the loan and plaintiff filed a complaint to foreclose the mortgage. Instead of seeking a default judgment and order for eviction against defendants, plaintiff moved for summary judgment. The lower court granted plaintiff's motion and defendants appealed. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and defendants sought review. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. Defendants contended that the amended Anti-Eviction Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. tit. 2A, &sect;&sect; 18-61.1 to 61.12, prohibited the court from entering an order for possession for plaintiff absent a showing of statutory good cause. N.J. Stat. Ann. tit. 2A, &sect; 18-61.3b, applied the Act to foreclosing mortgagees. The court held that, as amended, the Act protected tenants from eviction by foreclosing mortgagees irrespective of whether their tenancy was established before or after the execution of the mortgage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court that had affirmed the order of the lower court. The court was convinced that the injury from a possible impairment to resale value because mortgagees' residential property would be of greater value in vacant condition than if occupied by tenants was substantially outweighed by the public concerns that the Anti-Eviction Act addressed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the court had the power to enjoin the non-violent, non-criminal activity of defendants to protect plaintiffs' residential privacy provided the restrictions balanced defendants' free-speech rights and plaintiffs' residential-privacy interests. The court held that the injunctions were content neutral, and that a significant government interest existed in favor of protection of residential privacy, which justified the imposition of injunctive restrictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certification from the Superior Court (New Jersey), the court considered the question of whether the legislature may adopt a statutory amendment that prohibited an agency from adopting regulations that conflict with the amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:2H-5.8(a), a subsection of the Health Care Cost Reduction Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general issue was whether the legislature could adopt a statutory amendment that prohibited an agency from adopting regulations that conflicted with the amendment. More specifically, the issue concerned the constitutionality of an amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:2H-5.8(a), a subsection of the Health Care Cost Reduction Act. The amendment restricted the authority of the Department of Health (DOH) to adopt regulations pertaining to the State Health Plan. The court held that as between the legislature and the DOH, the legislature had the power to formulate state policy on the controversial issue of health-care planning. The express statutory standards, the delegated authority to adopt non-conflicting regulations, and the permission to consider the State Health Plan constituted sufficient safeguards to withstand the DOH's due-process challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the appeals court's affirmance of his conviction for violation of the drug kingpin statute under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-3. Defendant participated in four drug transactions with an undercover officer. While speaking with defendant, the undercover officer noticed significant traffic in and out of the house. Defendant removed from his pants pocket a plastic bag containing one ounce of cocaine and separated the cocaine into two approximately equal piles and gave the cocaine to the officer in exchange for cash. The trial court found defendant guilty. The appeals court affirmed the verdict of the trial court. On further review, the court held that the drug kingpin statute was not unconstitutionally vague, either facially or as applied to defendant's conduct. Although defendant did not rule over a vast criminal empire, the state's evidence, evaluated in its best light, demonstrated that defendant had performed acts clearly prohibited by &sect; 2C:35-3. Therefore, the court held that the statute was not vague as applied to defendant's conduct. The court held that a reasonable jury would determine that the state had proven its case. The court affirmed the verdict.</SPAN></P>

To ease the burden on appellant city, the court modified the appellate court's decision to direct appellant HCBT to calculate the appropriate debits and credits, and implement them on a pro-rated basis over a reasonable period of time. The court affirmed the elimination of the two-tiered county tax rate. The court concluded that N.J. Stat. Ann. tit. 18A, &sect; 54-37, did not represent a reasonable legislative classification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failing to deliver a controlled dangerous substance to a law enforcement officer in violation of N.J.

The trial court granted defendant's motion in arrest of judgment and held that &sect; 2C:35-10(c) impermissibly compromised defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. The state appealed, and the trial court reinstated the conviction. A lower appellate court reversed the conviction and reinstated the acquittal. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 2C:35-10(c) was not unconstitutional because it provided transactional immunity for &sect; 25:35-10(c) offenses to persons complying with its provisions, and use and derivative-use immunity in respect to all other offenses. Defendant's conviction was not barred by assertion of his privilege against self-incrimination where, if he had voluntarily surrendered to law-enforcement officers the cocaine unlawfully in his possession, the cocaine would not have been admissible in subsequent prosecution. The court also noted that the state would have had to prove that any other evidence admitted against defendant was unrelated to the surrender of the cocaine.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court's jury instruction which placed on defendant, who was asserting the defense of diminished capacity, the burden of proof to establish the existence of a mental disease violated defendant's due process rights. The court held that defendant presented sufficient expert testimony to warrant a jury instruction on diminished capacity because defendant presented evidence that his faculties were sufficiently affected to preclude him from engaging in purposeful or knowing conduct when he harmed the infant. The court held that defendant's confession was voluntary even though the police used psychological pressure and lied to convince defendant to confess. The court held that the evidence was not sufficient to justify submission of a third-degree child endangerment charge to the jury because defendant did not have a general and ongoing responsibility for the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, independent contractor and spouse, filed a products liability action against defendants, manufacturer and distributor. Plaintiffs alleged that use of a cleaner caused plaintiff independent contractor to suffer from occupational asthma and that defendants knowingly placed the dangerous product into the stream of commerce. Following a jury verdict, the trial court awarded compensatory and punitive damages in favor of plaintiffs. The lower appellate court reversed the award of punitive damages. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that plaintiffs had the burden of establishing the ability of defendant distributor to pay punitive damages because the absence of such evidence precluded the jury from having a proper foundation to assess damages. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of defendant distributor's financial condition where its president testified that the product in question was its best seller and that it accounted for one-third of its gross sales, and that he had sold the company's stock for $ 750,000. The court reasoned that the recent sale of the stock, in an arms-length transaction, was conclusive evidence of value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer sought review of a decision dismissing him for insubordination, and the lower court affirmed the trial court's order affirming the dismissal. Members of defendant police department arrested plaintiff on suspicion of selling cocaine and directed him to provide a urine sample. Plaintiff refused to obey the order. Defendant dismissed plaintiff for insubordination. On further appeal, the court found that that the individualized-reasonable-suspicion standard sufficiently restricted the discretion of police supervisors to protect officers against arbitrary and discriminatory testing. The court found no testimonial compulsion in the collection and analysis of urine for illegal drugs. Further the court held that plaintiff had not carried his burden of persuasion that confusion over the privilege against self-incrimination led him to refuse to provide a urine sample for a drug test. Finally, the court held that the attorney-client privilege did not apply to plaintiff's statements to a union representative. The court affirmed the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee appealed a decision by the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed a judgment that plaintiff's breach of contract complaint against defendant former employer violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:15-59.1b(2) by failing to state a cause of action that had a reasonable basis in law or equity and awarded defendant attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate division's ruling affirming a judgment that plaintiff former employee's action for breach of an employment contract against defendant former employer was a frivolous action in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:15-59.1 and awarding defendant attorney's fees. The court held that &sect; 2A:15-59.1 applied sanctions to parties, but not to attorneys because applying it to attorneys would raise a question of whether the statute impinged on the court's exclusive power under N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, para. 3 to discipline attorneys. The court found that &sect; 2A:15-59.1 did not deny plaintiff due process because an application for counsel fees under it required a detailed affidavit of costs and had to be brought by a motion under N.J. Ct. R. 1:6, thereby providing the non-prevailing party with adequate notice of the claim. The court held that plaintiff did not act in bad faith as she made an honest attempt to press a perceived, if ill founded, claim and she relied on counsel's advice in good faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate division's decision and limited the application of a New Jersey statute proscribing frivolous lawsuits to parties while holding that it did not provide for the award of counsel's fees and costs against attorneys. The court held that plaintiff former employee did not act in bad faith in asserting her claim for breach of contract against defendant former employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former mayor, but mayor when he applied, challenged a judgment from the appellate court (New Jersey), which affirmed a decision of the lower court upholding the planning board's proceedings but invalidating his approvals for a construction project, because of conflicts of interest. Plaintiff property owners brought the original action, claiming the principal use of the property required a use variance from the board of adjustment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reconsidering defendant former mayor's application proposing a construction project and addressing plaintiff property owner's concerns, the court held that treating apartments as an accessory to commercial use was inappropriate because apartments were not a conditional use in the zone where they were proposed. The court found that the mayor's appointed building official should have been disqualified because he was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. Because most New Jersey communities were governed by citizens of other callings who served their communities part time, the court asserted that they should not be deprived of the ordinary citizen's rights, but should also not create a pecuniary personal interest that conflicted with the fiduciary duty owed to the public. The court found that public skepticism and disillusionment were heightened by the timing and nature of the application and, therefore, the judgment of the appellate court invalidating the approvals was affirmed, but, modified because rather than remanding to the planning board, the court ordered that the remand be to the zoning board of adjustment where defendant could seek a variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment that invalidated defendant former mayor's development approvals, as sought by plaintiff property owners, and modified the judgment remanding the matter to the planning board for a new application. Unless the ordinance was amended to permit residential apartments as a principal use in the zone where they were proposed, an application would have to be made to the zoning board of adjustment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Commissioner of Insurance, challenged the order of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which invalidated appellant's order imposing transitional assessments on insurance companies for their asserted failure to meet quotas established by the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:33B-1 to -63, and directed appellant to implement a rate increase assessment only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Commissioner of Insurance, challenged the lower court's order that denied him the authority to impose transitional assessments on insurance companies because of the insurance companies' asserted failure to meet depopulation quotas under the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990 (Act), N.J.

The quotas were designed to transfer drivers from the Market Transition Facility (MTF), a government agency created to provide temporary automobile insurance coverage to high-risk drivers, into the private insurance market. The lower court directed appellant to implement the MTF rate increase he had already found to be necessary. The court affirmed. The court held that appellant lacked the authority to impose the transitional assessments either as a regulatory adjustment or as a revenue-raiser under the Act, and that the assessments were not sustainable as a penalty or enforcement measure. The intractable problem of providing insurance for high-risk drivers required legislation to resolve definitively the extent and measure of appellant's authority under the Act.</SPAN></P>

Appellant state public advocate sought review and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that appellee's adoption of the occupancy preference, in the context of its existing methodology for calculating and allocating indigenous, present, and regional need for affordable housing, was invalid because it was inconsistent with and undermined the methodology adopted by appellee for calculating and allocating regional fair share of low- and moderate-income housing. In that framework the occupancy preference did not comport with the Act's central purpose of providing affordable housing on a regional basis consistent with both sound planning concepts and the Mount Laurel doctrine.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured filed a complaint against defendant insureds, alleging negligent handling on his insurance claim, which defendants failed to pay until nine months after an accident that destroyed plaintiff's tractor-trailer.

The court held that defendants had a duty of fair dealing in processing plaintiff's claim and that defendants breached that duty. The court held that plaintiff could recover damages for consequential economic losses, because he established bad faith by showing that no valid reasons existed to delay processing his claim and that defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that no valid reasons supported the delay.</SPAN></P>

Defendant kidnapped the victim in an attempt to gain quick cash and then shot the victim in the back of the head three times when he thought that the victim might attempt to get away. A jury trial convicted defendant on all charges and sentenced him to death. On appeal, defendant argued over 25 points of error. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, but remanded the matter for proper sentencing on the kidnapping charge. The court held that the trial court had conducted a sufficiently thorough voir dire to probe into the potential biases of the prospective jurors, that the state was not required to make every aggravating factor a subject of the indictment, and that defendant's request to speak with his girlfriend prior to cooperating with police was not an indication of a desire to remain silent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases defendants were charged with selling drugs within 1000 feet of a school pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7. Defendants entered into plea agreements that granted a waiver of the mandatory prison term in exchange for their appearance at the sentencing hearing. Both failed to appear, and the prosecutors withdrew the waivers of mandatory sentence. The trial courts sentenced the defendants with mandatory terms of parole ineligibility. The intermediate appellate courts reversed the imposition of the mandatory sentence and either imposed sentence or remanded for renegotiation of the plea agreement. On appeal the court reversed and remanded and held that the trial courts were required to determine whether the enforcement of the plea agreements would be fundamentally unfair. The trial courts were required to test the prosecutors' inclusion of the no-appearance/no-waiver provision in the plea agreements against the prosecutors' stated guidelines governing whether to grant or deny leniency. If defendants' failure to appear at sentencing warranted revocation of the waiver provision in the pleas, the trial courts were required to sentence in accordance with the drug laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that found the no-appearance/no-waiver agreements in defendants' plea bargain imposed an undue burden on judicial sentencing authority and held that the provisions were enforceable because once accepted by the trial court the plea agreement governed the sentencing. Remand was appropriate to determine whether enforcement of the agreements would be fundamentally unfair.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, state employees and legislators, filed complaints against defendants, the governor of New Jersey and executive branch officials, seeking a judgment that defendants were in violation of provisions in the 1993 Fiscal Year Appropriations Act, as amended by Senate Bill 996, L. 1992, c. 99, which restricted layoffs of state personnel, and requesting a stay of scheduled layoffs. Plaintiffs' requests for a stay were denied by the appellate division; the cases were consolidated and certified for review. The court held that the Appropriations Amendments Act, Senate Bill 996, &sect; 1 was void because it violated the separation-of-powers principle as embodied in N.J. Const. art. III, para. 1, by allowing the legislature to interfere excessively with the governor's constitutional authority to manage government. The court held that the 1993 Appropriations Act, Senate Bill 1000, L. 1992, c. 40, &sect; 38 was also unconstitutional insofar as it purported to dictate to the executive whom he may and may not lay off.

Petitioner challenged the &quot;forfeiture condition,&quot; which required petitioner's affiliates to terminate business in New Jersey within five years, and the &quot;new-business condition,&quot; which required petitioner to comply with the Reform Act during its withdrawal. The new-business condition did not violate due process rights because the justification for imposing that condition was compelling. Due process was not offended by requiring petitioner to comply with the Reform Act during its withdrawal. The regulatory interest was adequate to sustain the forfeiture condition against a substantive due process challenge. The conditions did not deny petitioner equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a jury. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed but the sentence was reversed and remanded. At the second sentencing, the jury again returned a death sentence. On the second appeal, defendant challenged that the original conviction did not establish death eligibility, and that the errors in the sentencing proceeding required reversal. The court affirmed both the conviction and the sentence, agreeing with defendant that some errors were present, but their cumulative effect did not require reversal. Because the evidence showed that defendant intended death for his victim, the jury had a rational basis for its verdict. As for the sentencing, defendant's equal protection challenge to the jury venire failed as there was a fair cross section of the population, the aggravating circumstances were admissible, the admissibility of the mitigating evidence was ordered to be considered in the light most favorable to defendant; the prosecutorial misconduct was harmless, and he had the effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3e, defendant requested a proportionality review of his death sentence after the court affirmed defendant's conviction under a separate opinion. The court first gave structure to and defined the proportionality review process that it followed in reviewing defendant's petition. The court determined that it would use the information at its disposal to identify similar cases in terms of blameworthiness, then examine the prosecutorial and juries patterns for frequency or of frequency of death verdicts in similar cases, and then finally look at the comparison cases to identify disproportionality. The court found the process to be thorough and constitutional. From its analysis using the composite of the measures of frequency in the proportionality review process, the court affirmed defendant's death sentence because it concluded that capital death sentencing for contract murderers was not random or an aberration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant borough enacted an ordinance regulating quarries that imposed a licensing requirement and limited the depth below which property could not be quarried. Plaintiff quarry commenced a suit, contending that the ordinance effectively prohibited its use of its property as a quarry thereby constituting a compensable governmental taking. The trial court ruled against plaintiff, but remanded for defendant's reconsideration. The appellate court affirmed. On the parties' petition and cross-petition for certification, the court affirmed. Defendant had the power to enact the licensing ordinance and to require the licensing of quarries. The evidence demonstrated a reasonable basis for defendant to believe that the operations of the quarry below the permissible level would create genuine and substantial risks of harm to the public and the environment, thus, the ordinance advanced a valid public purpose. Further, the interference with plaintiff's property interests was not excessive or unreasonable, nor did it deprive the property of substantial value or prevent its use for other economically viable purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a plea agreement for a school zone drug offense, which provided that the three-year parole ineligibility term fixed by N.J.

Later, defendant pleaded guilty to probation violation, and the trial court imposed a four-year custodial term with three years of parole ineligibility. The appellate court remanded for resentencing without the period of parole ineligibility, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court remanded to the trial court for resentencing, because the trial court felt compelled to impose the parole disqualifier, and the statutes did not compel the imposition of a mandatory period of parole disqualification with respect to resentencing for the probation violation. The sentencing scheme applicable to school zone drug offenders did not preclude the imposition of a period of parole disqualification in conjunction with a sentence following violation of probation, which was a matter of sound judicial discretion to be exercised in appropriate cases based on adequate reasons.</SPAN></P>

Const. art I, para. 4. Applying the Lemon test, the court held that the regulations fostered excessive government entanglement with religion by requiring strict compliance with the laws and customs of the Orthodox Jewish religion and by involving the government in disputes over kosher laws. The regulations violated the effects prong of the test because the secular goal of protecting consumers from fraud could not be separated from the primary effect of promoting religious tenets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to a second-degree crime and was sentenced to prison. Seven months later, she was released and admitted into New Jersey's Intensive Supervision Program (ISP), a sentencing alternative that released certain defendants from prison under strict supervision. Plaintiff state appealed defendant's ISP admission and the appellate court denied plaintiff's application for a stay. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court agreed to determine whether it had power to sentence first- and second-degree offenders to probationary terms in the face of ISP's inconsistency with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-1d, which required that all such offenders be imprisoned. The enactment of ISP exceeded the court's power because it conflicted with a valid exercise of legislative power to determine punishment, thus ISP was an impermissible sentencing alternative. Although the legislature's subsequent support of ISP through continued appropriations was strong evidence of approval, it was insufficient to operate as an implicit repeal. In light of the executive and legislative support of ISP, the court suspended the effective date of its judgment to permit legislative action in the interim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's admission into Intensive Supervision Program (ISP), because despite her completion of the program which rendered the decision without practical effect as to her, ISP was an impermissible sentence as to first- and second-degree offenders, due to its conflict with a statute that mandated imprisonment for such offenders.</SPAN></P>

He brought an action against appellee comrades, the State of New Jersey, and the manufacturer of the vehicle in which he was riding. The trial court dismissed appellees and the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attorney, as intervenor, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed the trial court's ruling that plaintiff employee's product liability claim against defendant foreign company was time-barred as N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22 did not operate to toll the statute of limitations because that statute imposed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee was injured by defendant foreign company's machine. Defendant attorney failed to timely inform plaintiff of a potential product liability claim and was sued for malpractice. Defendant attorney's successful defense was that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22 tolled the statute of limitations on the product liability claim. Plaintiff sued defendant foreign company. The trial court granted defendant foreign company's motion for summary judgment, holding that the statute imposed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce as it tolled the limitations period against non-resident defendants. Defendant attorney intervened and sought review. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute, which prior to its 1992 amendment facially discriminated against non-resident defendants, was subject to and failed the strict scrutiny test. The statute also failed the balancing test because defendant foreign company would have had to move to New Jersey to receive the benefit of the tolling provision. The court refused to find that the statute would be void prospectively, as policy considerations did not merit prospective application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because the statute, which purported to toll the statute of limitations against non-resident defendants, was discriminatory on its face and failed both the strict scrutiny and balancing tests under the Commerce Clause and thus was void. The court refused to apply its decision prospectively, rather than retroactively, because policy considerations did not warrant prospective application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent fisheries corporation filed an action against appellant state agencies that attacked N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7:25, &sect;&sect; 22.2(a)2, 22.3(b)2, and 22.3(b)3, which prohibited fishing for menhaden within certain areas.

On appeal, the court granted both parties' petition for certification, affirmed in part, and reversed so much of the appellate court's judgment that held that the regulations were invalid as applied to the Delaware Bay. The court held that the 1905 compact between Delaware and New Jersey had not applied because there was no dispute between the states regarding the fishing regulations but simply a dispute between New Jersey and respondent. The court additionally found that the regulations had not discriminated against interstate commerce and the incidental burden imposed on interstate commerce by the regulations was not clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19:46-6 to -14, created the Redistricting Commission. Plaintiff residents sought an injunction barring the redistricting plan (plan), which was denied by the trial court and certified to the court on its own motion, and plaintiff, resident, relied on N.J.

The court held that legislature in invoking the court with original jurisdiction violated N.J. Const. art.

The court held that congressional redistricting was one of those limited &quot;special purposes&quot; which a &quot;temporary commission&quot; was permissible under N.J. Const. art. V, &sect; 4, p. 1, and that a valid delegation occurred because the enabling legislation offered directives to ensure that the plan was consistent with the requirements of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed the trial court's conviction for perjury, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly gave false testimony during a capital murder trial which resulted in an acquittal. Defendant was acquitted of one count of perjury, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:28-1, and convicted on the second count after the trial judge determined that the element of materiality existed as a matter of law as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:28-1b. The appellate court affirmed the conviction but questioned the constitutionality of the perjury statute. The court granted defendant's petition for certification limited to the issue of the constitutionality of the perjury statute. The court reversed because it found that the portion of the perjury statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;2C:28-1b, which declared that whether a falsification was material was a question of law was an unconstitutional violation of defendant's right to a jury trial under N.J. Const. art. I, para. 9, 10 as to all of the elements of the offense, including materiality. The court found that the error was not harmless and thus vacated the perjury conviction. The court remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court that affirmed defendant's perjury conviction, vacated the conviction, and remanded to the trial court because a jury should have heard the issue of materiality as an element of the offense of perjury. The court found that the portion of the statute which determined that the issue of materiality was a question of law violated the right to a jury trial for all elements of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. 46:16-1.1 after respondent town foreclosed on his property without adequate notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bona fide purchaser bought respondent property owner's property from respondent town at a foreclosure sale. Prior to the foreclosure sale respondent property owner, who had no notice of the impending foreclosure, had obtained an order vacating the tax foreclosure judgment. Respondent property owner failed to record the vacation order, and, thus, appellant was not aware of the improper foreclosure when he purchased the property. The trial court refused to order quiet title in favor of appellant, holding that, based on the order vacating the tax foreclosure, respondent town had no title to convey to appellant. On appeal, the court affirmed but for different legal reasons. The court held that respondent town's notice to respondent property owner regarding the foreclosure was defective and that respondent property owner acted in a timely fashion in vacating the order. The court held that respondent property owner should have recorded the vacation order in the county deed book, but that the balance of equities tipped in favor of finding that it was entitled to the return of its property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, which affirmed defendant's sentence and found that N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order which affirmed his sentence under N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:43-6f, arguing that it violated the separation-of-powers doctrine and equal protection and that the fine violated equal protection and was cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:43-6f was unconstitutional because it lacked of any guidelines and any avenue for effective judicial review. Thus, it significantly increased the danger of uneven application and violated separation of powers. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:43-6f did not violate equal-protection rights because it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of battling crime by punishing recidivists more severely. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:35-15 did not violate defendant's equal-protection rights by imposing a fine because it reasonably furthered the legitimate interests of providing for the strict punishment, deterrence, incapacitation of the most culpable and dangerous drug offenders, and facilitating rehabilitation. Thus, the court reversed and remanded that part of the order imposing an extended-term sentence on defendant and affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court with respect to its affirmance of defendant's extended-term sentence because the lack of guidelines or avenues for judicial review in the statute violated separation of powers. The court affirmed the remainder of the appellate court's judgment because the extended sentence and fine statutes were rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the order which reversed the decision to deny defendant's petition for post-conviction relief. The state argued that defendant could have raised the issue on direct appeal and that there was a sufficient factual basis for defendant's plea. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the appellate court and reinstated the trial court's order which denied defendant's petition for post-conviction relief. The court held that defendant did not claim excusable neglect, allege any facts excusing his delay, or constitute a petition to correct an illegal sentence. Thus, his petition was time-barred. The court held that defendant did not show he was an innocent party who mistakenly pled guilty or received a manifestly improper sentence. Thus, barring his petition under N.J. R. Crim. P. 3:22-12 did not create an &quot;injustice&quot; that would have justified relaxation of the N.J. R. Crim. P. 1:1-2. The court held that defendant's petition did not raise an issue of constitutional dimension and that denying the relief did not result in a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed the trial court's decision to merge convictions for drug possession violations under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5 and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7 and further concluded that the minimum mandatory sentence required by &sect; 2C:35-7 should be imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana and phencyclidine with intent to distribute, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5, and possession of the same substances with intent to distribute within a school zone, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7. All violations were a part of the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act and were the result of defendant's arrest for narcotics activity at a bar located within 1000 feet of a school zone. The trial court merged the school zone convictions with the other convictions because to uphold both convictions would have violated defendants rights of due process under U.S. Const. amend XIV and double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend. V and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 11. The trial court did impose the mandatory minimum sentence as set forth in &sect; 2C:35-7 for school zones. The appellate division affirmed, and the court also affirmed. The court found that the legislative purpose of the school zone statutes and double jeopardy rights required the merger of the convictions with the imposition of the mandatory sentence on a defendant convicted of the related offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the merger of the convictions and the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence because the legislative purpose of enacting the school zone statutes was best served, consistent with double jeopardy principles, by the merger of the convictions and by construing the two sections of the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act to require that any imposed sentence include the mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for controlled dangerous substances offenses imposed in the Superior Court, Camden County (New Jersey), alleging that his simultaneous convictions under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four offenses; he filed a motion for the merger of two of them, contending that his third-degree charge for distribution of cocaine within a school zone, a violation of the school-zone statute,&nbsp;N.J.

On appeal, the court reversed the denial of merger, and remanded the case to the trial court for an amended judgment vacating defendant's conviction for distribution of cocaine within a school zone under &sect; 2C:35-7. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed. The court held that multiple punishments for related convictions under &sect; 2C:35-5 and &sect; 2C:35-7 violated double jeopardy. Because &sect; 2C:35-5 carried the greater punishment of the two provisions, its minimum mandatory sentence was the one to which defendant was subject. Defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the unconstitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-15 were summarily rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated defendant's conviction of distribution of cocaine within a school zone because federal double-jeopardy principles required that offense to merge with his conviction of the more grave offense of distribution of more than five ounces of cocaine; in all other respects, the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following remand from an earlier appeal, the trial court conducted a new sentencing proceeding. The trial court denied a request of one of defendant's counsel to withdraw. The trial court denied the state's motion for an order that allowed use of defendant's prior conviction for murder in a unrelated case. The trial court also denied defendant's motion that the jury be charged separately on six proffered bases for the catch-all mitigating factor under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3C(5)(h). Defendant contended that the he had not been convicted of capital murder because there had been no guilt phase jury finding of a specific intent to kill or a finding that the murder was committed by defendant's own conduct. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred when it did not change venue on its own motion and that the voir dire for the resentencing proceeding was inadequate. The court reversed and remanded for a new resentencing proceeding because the death-qualification process of the voir dire was inadequate to ensure defendant's constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the appellate court's decision to reverse defendant conviction's for aggravated sexual assault, arguing that, under the Rape Shield law, N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:14-7, the trial court correctly excluded evidence of prior sexual abuse on the alleged victim by another. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court and held that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its possible prejudicial effect. The court held that the admission of the evidence was admissible because it rebutted the inference that the alleged victim acquired the knowledge to describe sexual matters from her experience with defendant. The court held that the evidence of the alleged victim's prior sexual abuse could have been admitted without undue prejudice by allowing the defense to cross-examine the police rather than the alleged victim. The court held that defense counsel was not permitted to try to show on cross-examination of the alleged victim that her prior sexual abuse enhanced the likelihood that she initiated the encounters with defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant synagogue employed appellee rabbi, but removed him from his position despite an employment contract. Appellee contested appellant's action, and appellant filed an action alleging, inter alia, that appellee had disrupted religious services and the orderly transaction of the congregation's business, had prevented other rabbis from serving the congregation, had diverted contributions and grant moneys, and had refused to surrender possession of appellant's rabbi residence. The court directed the parties to submit the dispute to the rabbinical court for resolution. Appellant initially challenged the order, the appellate division affirmed the trial court, and appellant then objected to the rabbinical court, but participated in proceedings before it. When the trial court adopted the rabbinical court's findings and issued its judgment based on the findings, appellant challenged the judgment. However, the appellate division affirmed the judgment. On appeal, the court also affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that by submitting to the jurisdiction and authority of the rabbinical court, appellant waived its U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that entered judgment on a religious tribunal's resolution of appellant synagogue's employment dispute with appellee rabbi was affirmed, because the parties were bound by the religious tribunal's decision due to their plenary agreement to submit their disputes to that body for its adjudication, and appellant's continuing appeals presented insufficient grounds to question the validity of that earlier submission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pool manufacturers challenged the order which reinstated respondent state's claim for reimbursement of medical expenses under the theories of subrogation, contribution, and strict liability. On appeal, the court reversed and held that respondent's subrogation claim for medical expenses could not have been greater than the subrogee's claim and that, because the subrogee's claim was time-barred, respondent's claim was time-barred as well. The court held that the result was not altered by the doctrine of nullum tempus because it was no longer applicable to governmental claims. The court held that respondent was entitled to contribution from appellants and that the proper comparison of fault was the fault of each third-party defendant with that of the injured party. The court held that respondent's potential liability under the Tort Claims Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. 59:1-1-12-3, did not bar its recovery against appellants based on strict products liability because appellants could have been held liable even in the event of product misuse if the misuse was objectively foreseeable and it was not clear, as a matter of law, that respondent's conduct was not foreseeable.</SPAN></P>

The lower court reversed in part and affirmed in part, dismissing certain allegations for lack of standing but rejecting defendants' remaining arguments. Defendants appealed. The court on appeal affirmed, holding that plaintiffs' surviving claims involved challenges to the legality of municipal actions and were, therefore, not subject to the jurisdiction of defendant administrative agency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner brought an action for inverse condemnation against defendant state agencies, alleging that the revised comprehensive management plan (CMP) enacted pursuant to the New Jersey Pinelands Protection Act (Act), N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:18A-1-29 resulted in an unlawful taking of his property. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, and the appeals court affirmed. The court affirmed, holding that in light of the environmental sensitivity of the area, the CMP did not constitute an unlawful taking, as it did not deprive plaintiff of the economic or beneficial use of all or most of his property, sufficiently diminish the value or profitability of his land, or otherwise interfere with his ownership interest. Moreover, the Act substantially advanced legitimate and important purposes, and the revised CMP directly furthered the central purposes of the Act. Finally, the court held that plaintiff's equal protection rights under N. J. Const. art.

Appellee's charitable nonprofit activities included conducting social services for hospitalized and nursing home patients, raising scholarship funds, serving as hospital and church volunteers, and organizing holiday drives to benefit needy families. The court concluded that that the classification of exempt property based on the characteristics of the property and the status of the owner were necessary to fulfill the public purpose of preserving historic sites. The court also found that the distinction between a for-profit corporation and a nonprofit organization that needed rental income to preserve its property was rational and reasonable. The court affirmed the lower court's decision, which upheld the tax exemption for the historic home, finding that the exemption statute existed exclusively to secure the preservation and maintenance of historic sites, and that purpose was served by appellee.</SPAN></P>

A police officer stopped and searched defendant as he rode his bicycle within 1,000 feet of an athletic field, which was owned by the local board of education, was leased to a secondary school, and was regularly used for public and parochial school activities. N.J. Stat.

The court found that so long as there were indicia from which an objectively reasonable person could know that the school property was used for school purposes, lack of knowledge by a drug dealer that he was within 1,000 feet of school property was irrelevant. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment sustaining defendant's conviction, finding that the legislature intended that athletic fields connected to the educational mission of a private high school to be protected safety zones.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent businessman located owners of unclaimed property that had been delivered to appellant state and offered to tell them of the unclaimed property for a contingent fee based on the amount in the account. He claimed that he was entitled to know the amounts in the accounts. The court held that the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:30B-1 et seq. (UUPA), prohibited disclosure of the amounts to anyone who did not have a beneficial interest in the account. The UUPA was enacted after the lower court decided the case and it had retroactive application because there was no express limit to prospective application. The court held that though UUPA required holders of unclaimed property to submit written reports to appellant including the amounts due, this information was not for disclosure pursuant to the public's right to know because there was a right to confidentiality in bank records and &sect; 46:30B-761 provided that the bank information was deemed confidential when delivered to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and related offenses in the strangling death of a victim that resulted from a fight between them in a dispute over drugs and money. Defendant was sentenced to death and contended that the trial court erred in submitting aggravating factors of torture and depravity of mind to the jury pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3c(4)(c). The court agreed and held that the act of strangling the victim could not be an aggravating factor pursuant to &sect; 2C:11-3c(4)(c) because it was not torture in that there was no proof that defendant intended to inflict extreme pain other than that incidental to the strangulation that caused the victim's death. Further, the court found that the state failed to prove that defendant had a &quot;depravity of mind&quot; or killed the victim for pleasure or for no reason whatsoever. Because torture and depravity should not have been submitted to the jury as aggravating factors, the court reversed the death penalty and remanded the case to the trial court for further sentencing as directed by the court.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the order, claiming that the loans it was required to make violated the debt limitation clause of the state constitution, that the Act was void for vagueness, and that it was entitled to declaratory judgement setting the terms and conditions of the loans. The court held that the requirement to provide future funding did not violate the debt limitation clause.

The appellate division granted appellant leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insurance companies filed suit against appellant state, challenging the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;17:30A-1 et seq. Respondents contended that the act constituted confiscatory taking and that the costs could not be passed on to customers. The lower court granted respondents a preliminary injunction and appellant sought review of that decision. The court reversed the decision in part and modified it in part, holding that the act was not facially unconstitutional as a confiscatory taking. In considering the act's terms and the interrelationship of its provisions, the legislative history, and the regulations, the court concluded that the act absolutely prohibited rate relief to insurers in the form of direct passthroughs of surtaxes and assessments in standard ratemaking. Nonetheless, the legislature's assurance of an adequate rate of return and the creation of a special rate-relief process showed that not all insurers were kept from earning a fair rate of return. The commissioner was able to consider the surtaxes and assessments in affording rate relief to an insurance company otherwise unable to earn a fair rate of return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and modified in part, holding that the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act did not, on its face, impose a confiscatory taking, and that it met the minimal requirements for constitutionality under a substantive due process analysis. Therefore, respondents insurance companies were not entitled to an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee brought an action against defendants, manufacturer, and trustee after he lost most of his right hand while operating a molding machine. Plaintiff commenced the action in federal court against defendant manufacturer, and against defendant trustee as recipient of the corporate assets, because defendant manufacturer was dissolved as a corporation under Illinois law 13 days before plaintiff's accident. The federal court dismissed the case against defendants. Plaintiff did not appeal the federal court decision, but filed a complaint virtually identical to his federal complaint in state court. The trial court dismissed the complaint against defendants. The lower court affirmed the trial court's dismissals based on res judicata. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court declared that to authorize plaintiff's nearly identical application to state court after an unfavorable federal decision would be an endorsement of forum sampling.

The court affirmed the lower court's declaratory judgment that the census data received by the governor's office on January 24 and 30, 1991, constituted the official decennial census and that the delivery on January 30, 1991, constituted the full receipt of the census because a literal adherence to the words selected in art. IV, &sect; 3, para. 1 carefully defining the mechanics and administration of government was mandated. The court held that the meaning of the phrase official decennial census embraced the data officially delivered to the governor by the census bureau on January 24 and 30, 1991. The court held that it did not express an opinion on whether the census was complete for all federal purposes but limited its decision to the meaning of official decennial census within the constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent limited partnership, which was establishing a cooperative, challenged the constitutionality of the Cooperative Recording Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8D-1 to -18, which exempted units formed prior to the Act's 1988 enactment. The court found that the fact that other available methods might achieve the same ends did not warrant respondent's conclusion that the recording requirements of the Act were arbitrary and unnecessary. The court noted that cooperative ownership constituted a hybrid form of property, and it was reasonable to treat the transfer of cooperative interests differently from the transfer of other real estate interests. The court affirmed the portion of the lower court's order finding no due process or equal protection violations. However, the court reversed that portion of the lower court's order concluding that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between pre-Act and post-Act cooperatives with respect to the transfer tax. The court noted that post-Act cooperatives were genuinely different from pre-Act cooperatives in their administrative expenses and benefits received, and therefore deserved different treatment.</SPAN></P>

As to issues arising out of the pretrial proceedings, the court held that there were no errors in the search warrant and subsequent admission of evidence, the trial court properly changed venue because of pretrial publicity, and the jury selection process was valid. As to the trial itself, the court rejected defendant's arguments that there was erroneous admission of hearsay evidence, that defendant's counsel was ineffective, and that there was insufficient evidence to convict. The court also held that while the prosecutor made some improper remarks during trial, they did not constitute reversible error. As to the sentencing phase, the court held that the jury properly considered aggravating and mitigating factors in determining defendant's sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for capital murder, he relied on the affirmative defense of insanity under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-1. Evidence indicated that he sustained a brain injury when he was 16 and his life since was a chronicle of bizarre, violent behavior, and mental illness. During one hospitalization, he was diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder. In its jury instructions, the trial court charged not only on that defense, but also on diminished capacity under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2. On review, the court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence of death. The court found that the diminished capacity instruction improperly placed on defendant the burden of establishing by a preponderance that he suffered from a mental disease or defect at the time of the homicide and impermissibly relieved the state of part of its burden of proving that the homicide was knowing or purposeful. The court found the instruction was defective, had the capacity to produce an unjust result and, as such, constituted plain error. The court also found the failure to provide a limiting instruction concerning aggravating factor was an independent ground for vacating defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death and appealed as of right pursuant to N.J. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of capital murder and two counts of weapons related offenses in the deaths of his pregnant wife and minor child. Defendant contended the trial court erred in instructing the jury that he had the burden of proof on the issue of diminished capacity. The court agreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that a shortly after the verdict, the U.S. Supreme court denied certiorari in a case which ruled that a defendant's due process rights were violated where he had the burden of proof as to the existence of a mental disease or defect. The court held that the charge was erroneous and it resulted in prejudicial harm to defendant because the only issue at trial was not whether defendant committed the murders, but whether he had a diminished state of mind that negated the requisite state of mind required for murder. The court found that defendant had presented medical evidence that he had a stress-induced psychosis that grew out of a borderline personality disorder which affected his cognitive faculties, and a jury could have concluded that the state failed to prove the mens rea required for murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court because defendant's due process rights had been violated where he was required to assume the burden of proving that he had diminished capacity of his cognitive faculties at the time he killed his pregnant wife and minor child.

On appeal, the appellate court found that the development fees were invalid taxes, but that appellants lacked the standing to request refunds on the taxes for its member. The court affirmed the decision regarding the standing issue, but reversed the decision concerning the fees. The court held that fact that respondents sought to accomplish the general-welfare goal of affordable housing by development fees rather than by mandatory set-asides did not negate a real and substantial relationship of such development fees to the regulation of land. Although the development-fee measures were not site-specific in the same sense as mandatory set-asides, they implicated land-related regulations because they were specifically designed and applied to aid in the creation of affordable residential housing under N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At age 17, defendant was indicted on charges of knowing or purposeful murder by his own conduct (capital murder) among many other crimes.

The appellate court rejected defendant's request to withdraw the plea and defendant appealed. Reversing the judgment of the appellate court, the court held that defendant's belief, incorrect as a matter of law, that he was subject to the death penalty was a sufficient basis for withdrawal of his guilty plea because avoidance of the death penalty was a substantial factor in his decision to plead guilty.

Defendant appealed contending that the trial court's failure to instruct the jury separately for the crimes of knowingly or purposely causing death (intentional murder) and of knowingly or purposely causing serious bodily injury resulting in death (serious-bodily-injury murder) required reversal of his conviction. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that where the evidence provided a rational basis for a jury to convict defendant of either intentional or serious-bodily-injury murder, the trial court erred by not instructing the jury to specify which, if either, of those findings formed the basis for a conviction. The court held that where police failed scrupulously to honor defendant's right to cut off questioning and failed to give fresh Miranda warnings before resuming questioning, the illegality rendered the suspect's subsequent inculpatory confession unconstitutionally compelled as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate for state assembly filed an action to compel respondent secretary of state to place his name on the ballot. The court reversed the appellate court's order that failure to give notice within the seven day statutory period of a vacancy on the ballot invalidated appellant's selection as a candidate at the subsequent party-committee meeting because the seven day deadline of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:13-20(b)(1) was not mandatory and appellant properly filled the vacancy. The court held that the only timetable in the statute for holding the party-committee meeting to fill the vacancy was the requirement that the candidate's name be sent to respondent 48 hours before the general election. The court held that the unimportance of the timing of the notice was underscored by the fact that it was not required to be given in writing or to be mailed. The court held that the amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. 19:27-11.1 which foreclosed the party from selecting a candidate if a write-in effort was attempted in the primary but failed was not retroactive and did not apply to this case where the amendment occurred after the vacancy but before it was filled.</SPAN></P>

There was a rational basis in the evidence for the jury to have found defendant intended to cause only serious bodily injury. The court reversed defendant's convictions for aggravated assault because the trial court did not inform the jury that it could convict defendant of aggravated assault only if it found that defendant was aware that it was practically certain that when he pointed the gun at the victim, he was pointing it at or in the direction of persons other than the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Facing his third charge of driving while intoxicated, defendant pleaded guilty to the offense after his motion for a jury trial was denied. The court upheld the lower court's order affirming the denial of his motion. It concluded that the statutory penalties imposed by the state for the offense did not signal the legislature's intent to treat DWI as the functional equivalent of a crime, noting that third-time offenders such as defendant would not face a sentence of more than six months. It found that the 10-year license suspension for third offenders, although a heavy burden, was not more of a loss than that of a business or professional license, which could be taken away with no more than a hearing. Moreover, it noted, at one time repeat offenders faced the permanent loss of their licenses. It added that no other loss of privilege, franchise, or right of citizenship flowed from a DWI conviction. Therefore, it concluded, DWI in New Jersey could not be regarded as a &quot;serious&quot; offense as defined by the United States Supreme Court and did not entitle defendant to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), that convicted him of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, and endangering the life of a child by using a procedure authorized by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:84A-32.4, which allows a child victim to testify via closed-circuit television.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was alleged that defendant sexually abused a friend's daughter while she was under his care. The state's motion was granted to permit the child victim to testify via closed-circuit television pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:84A-32.4. Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, and endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant challenged the conviction. The appellate division determined that the statute was constitutional, but remanded for a N.J. R. Evid. 8 hearing. On the state's petition and defendant's cross-petition the court found the statute was constitutional. Additionally, the court concluded that an evidentiary hearing under N.J. R. Evid. 8 was not required because the judge could have determined from the various factors under child abuse statutes whether the use of such procedure was necessary to protect the welfare of the child. The trial court should have considered if the child witness would have been traumatized by the presence of the defendant and whether such emotional distress suffered by presence of defendant was more than de minimis requiring that the confrontation clause be denied for furtherance of public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the trial court's findings concerning the child's objective manifestations of fear were sufficient to meet constitutional standards, but it should have also considered the outlined factors in making particularized findings regarding the likelihood of emotional distress suffered by a child witness. The appellate division's remand for hearing under evidence rule was reversed as it was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents purchased a single family home that was later assessed at a higher property value. Respondents contended that such reassessment was discriminatory because appellant only reassessed properties which had been sold. Appellants claimed even if their acts were discriminatory it was within the perimeters of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:51A6, chap. 123. The passaic county board of taxation rendered judgment for respondents. Appellants challenged the board's decision, which the tax court reversed. It found that the assessments were permissible as long as it was within chap. 123's establishment range. The appellate division reversed the tax court holding raising the assessments only of recently-sold homes denied taxpayers equal protection. The court held that chap. 123 was not applicable in egregious cases of discrimination. The spot assessments violated both federal and state constitutions as taxpayers were protected under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, from being selected for discriminatory treatment by subjecting them to taxes not imposed on others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate division holding that spot assessments were in violation of the federal and state constitutions because comparable properties that had not been assessed carried a much lower tax burden than those recently sold. Such discrimination of appellants under the equal protection clause was not overridden by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted the defendant of two counts of knowing and purposeful murder, robbery in the first degree, theft of property, two counts of possession of a dangerous weapon for an unlawful purpose, and unlawful possession of a weapon. The defendant received a death sentence for one of the murders, a life sentence with 30 years of parole ineligibility for the second murder, and consecutive sentences totaling 35 years with 17.5 years of parole ineligibility on the remaining counts. On review, the court reversed the defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, because the court found that the police failed to scrupulously honor the defendant's right to remain silent. Therefore, the defendant's confession was inadmissible. The court further held that under the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine, the defendant's subsequent taped confession, as well as incriminating statements made immediately thereafter, were also inadmissible. The defendant's consent to search his room was likewise tainted by the illegally coerced confession, but the fruits of that search were admissible on retrial under the inevitable-discovery doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of conviction for capital murder, and remanded the cause for a new trial because it found that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that under the totality of the circumstances, defense counsel's strategy at trial was robbed of any presumption of competence and was deficient. Defense counsel's strategy at trial was not preceded by thorough investigation and consideration of all plausible options. At a minimum, an expert appraisal of defendant's mental condition and the effect of cocaine on his mental state was critical to making a competent strategy decision with respect to a diminished capacity or insanity defense. The court found defense counsel's reasoning that he failed to do so because &quot;nothing jogged his mind&quot; to be wholly unacceptable and indicative of his lack of expertise with respect to the special considerations in a capital case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two brutal murders and sentenced to death. He challenged his conviction and sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's murder conviction, set aside the death penalty, and remanded the case to the trial court for a new sentencing proceeding. The trial court's voir dire procedure did not deprive appellant of an impartial jury trial. The State did not exercise its peremptory challenges systematically to exclude racial minorities and women from the jury. Because the record contained nothing that would have supported a &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; murder charge, the trial court's failure to give that charge was not error. The trial court's language adequately explained and differentiated between active participation and accomplice liability for murder. The jury properly considered mitigating factors, and photographic evidence was properly admitted. The trial court's charge on the N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3(c)(4)(c) aggravating factor, however, was defective and warranted a new penalty phase hearing. The court noted that, at the new sentencing proceeding, sufficient evidence supported the resubmission to the jury of the &sect; 2C:11-3(c)(4)(c) aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

Following the penalty phase, defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant challenged his conviction and his sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, and, based upon the state's concession, set aside the death sentence and remanded the matter for a new sentencing proceeding. The court rejected defendant's claims that his counsel provided ineffective assistance due to his counsel's failure to make certain objections during the jury selection process, his failure to object to the admission of hearsay statements, and his failure to object to an inappropriate comment made by the state during closing argument. Under the facts of the case, the court also held that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on serious bodily injury murder. The court, however, set aside the death sentence because the trial court's charge requiring juror unanimity on a mitigating factor violated the principles subsequently enunciated by the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the capital conviction as of right, pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 2:2-1(a)(3). The state conceded that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that defendant was not guilty of capital murder if he knowingly or purposely caused serious bodily injury that resulted in death, as distinguished from knowingly or purposely causing the death of the victim. The appellate court held that the trial court's failure required reversal of defendant's conviction for capital murder. The court found that the instructions in the case were insufficient and that the court could not determine whether the jury convicted defendant of purposely or knowingly causing death or purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury that resulted in death. Without that determination, the court noted, defendant could not be convicted of capital murder. The court held that the error was reversible because the evidence was &quot;minimally adequate&quot; to provide a rational basis for the jury to find that defendant intended to cause serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's capital murder conviction of defendant. The court held that, in order to establish death-eligibility under N.J. Stat.

The court held that the trial court erroneously failed to explain to the jury that the indictment embraced two forms of murder, one capital and the other non-capital. Because the murder verdict could rationally have embraced capital or non-capital murder, the death penalty could not be sustained. If a sentence of death was to be imposed, the guilt phase of the capital murder charge had to be retried from the beginning, and because the robbery that established the single aggravating factor charged, murder in the course of robbery, was inextricably bound to the murder count, that robbery count had to be established in the murder proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant students challenged the constitutionality of the Public School Education Act of 1975 (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:7A-1 to 52, claiming that it did not afford a thorough and efficient educational funding system as required by a prior court decision. While the court had declared the Act constitutional, appellants attacked it as having failed to achieve its constitutional goal. After an administrative law judge determined that there were educational disparities between rich and poor districts, respondent Commissioner of Education declined to accept his recommendations. On review, respondent State Board of Education adopted that decision. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to poorer urban school districts because the constitutional mandate had not been fulfilled. Thus, the court ruled the Act had to be amended, or new legislation passed, to assure that poorer urban districts' educational funding was substantially equal to that of richer districts. Regardless, poorer urban districts were required to have a budget per pupil sufficient to address their special needs and approximately equal to the average of the richer districts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state sought review of the appeals court's decision issuing gun-carrying permits to petitioner applicants for use in petitioners' capacity as private security guards. Petitioners were former police officers whose current employer, a licensed private security company, required petitioners to carry guns in the performance of their duties. Both petitioners had received the blessing of the local police chief to carry firearms. Upon certified review, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:58-4d did not create a preference in favor of private security guards in obtaining gun permits. Under the statutory standard, gun permits could be issued only to those who could establish an urgent necessity for protection of themselves or others. Petitioners failed to meet this standard. Legislative intent in passing stringent gun control laws was to keep firearms out of the hands of citizens and did not grant private security guards a preference in this regard. The court reversed, revoking the issuance of gun permits to petitioners.</SPAN></P>

She sought review, contending that the trial court erred in refusing to give her requested instruction of self-defense as a justification to the charged offense. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.

He was sentenced on the non-capital counts to an aggregate term of life. Defendant's case was tried before two cases determining the constitutionality of N.J. Stat.

The jury charge in defendant's case failed to comply with the requirement that to impose the death penalty the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the statutory aggravating factors of section 2C:11-3 outweigh the mitigating factors. The charge would have permitted imposition of capital punishment on a finding that the aggravating and mitigating factors balanced.

Defendant pled guilty to a disorderly-persons offense of filing a false police report but was subsequently indicted for arson and attempted theft by deception and pled guilty with right to appeal.

On certification by the state, the court reversed the decision of the appellate court and remanded the case for consideration of whether principles of fundamental fairness were violated. The court held that defendant's subsequent indictment did not violate the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and state constitutions nor N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-10a(3) because the offense elements, the evidence for the offenses, and the conduct and the harm to be prevented were different. The mandatory joinder rule of N.J. Stat.

The Appellate Division remanded for entry of an order suppressing the evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test on the ground that it was the product of an unlawful arrest. The appeals court held that the hot pursuit exception to the warrant requirements of U.S. Const. amend IV were limited to serious offenses, and concluded that even absent a serious offense limitation, exigent circumstances did not exist in this case.

Thereafter, defendant was given a life sentence for the murder of the male victim, and was sentenced to death for the murder of the female victim. Upon review, defendant argued that the New Jersey Capital Punishment Act infringed on rights afforded him under the New Jersey Constitution and that it was error for the trial court to deny a motion to sever the murder offenses from the offenses that occurred two days prior. The court held that the death penalty statute did not violate the federal or state constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. Further, the court held that there was clearly a connection between the murders and the other offenses and that defendant was not significantly prejudiced by the joinder. Defendant also argued that the court erred in not instructing the jury that the evidence relating to the prior offenses were not to be considered as aggravating factors when determining the penalty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Superior Court, Camden County (New Jersey) after he was convicted of murder and received a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death following a dispute where defendant stabbed his sister's boyfriend for allegedly abusing her. The penalty phase charge to the jury failed to state that the death penalty could only be imposed if the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors. During deliberations, the jury indicated by a note that it could not find a unanimous decision with regard to weighing the factors. The trial court provided a supplemental charge to the jury on the issue but did not remind the jury that a non-unanimous verdict was acceptable. On review, the court held that in capital cases, jurors need not reach a unanimous verdict and a decision not to agree was a legally acceptable outcome which would result in a final verdict. Further, as long as one juror believed that the aggravating factors did not outweigh the mitigating factors, the jury could not impose the death penalty. By not ascertaining whether the jury's inquiry meant it had reached a verdict, defendant was deprived of the opportunity to receive a sentence other than death. As such, the death sentence was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder but reversed the sentence of death and remanded for a non-death sentence because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, thereby, depriving defendant of the possibility of receiving a sentence other than death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment from the Superior Court, Law Division, Burlington County (New Jersey), that found a probable cause hearing was required for a complaint charging a traffic offense and dismissed defendant's complaint for possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle contrary to N.J. Stat. Ann. 39:4-49.1 for lack of a probable cause determination, was certified for direct appeal on motion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding. After a pat down, the police officer found marijuana in defendant's pocket. The officer issued defendant a summons, which was part of a uniform traffic ticket, for the possession of the marijuana and for speeding. The complaint, also part of the uniform traffic ticket, was completed and signed by the police officer and filed with the municipal court. No hearing on probable cause was held. Defendant pled guilty to speeding and was found guilty on the marijuana charge. Upon review, the intermediate appellate court dismissed the complaint because of the absence of a probable cause hearing. The supreme court certified the case for direct appeal on its own motion. The supreme court found that under N.J. Ct. R. 7:3-1 and 7:6-1, the police officer issues a summons for a traffic offense without a probable cause hearing and attests to probable cause by signing the complaint. The supreme court vacated the judgment of the intermediate appellate court because Rules 7:3-1 and 7:6-1 nor the traffic ticket required or contemplated a probable cause hearing and the exigencies of law enforcement would make a hearing after the summons had issued infeasible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the order of the intermediate appellate court that dismissed defendant's complaint for a traffic violation because no probable cause finding was required for a complaint charging the commission of a traffic offense. Nonetheless, the supreme court remanded the matter to the municipal court for a new trial, as that it was undisputed that defendant received inadequate advice of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, leasing, enterprise, trucking, and supply companies, challenged judgments of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed their convictions of commercial vehicle registration violations under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-20, and appellant leasing and enterprise companies' conviction of exceeding the weight requirements for commercial vehicles under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-84b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, leasing, enterprise, trucking, and supply companies, were charged and convicted for violating the commercial vehicle registration law in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-20b because they operated at a weight in excess of that maximum authorized amount specified on the registration certificate. In addition, appellants, trucking and supply companies, were also charged and convicted for violating the separate excess-weight law in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-84b. The trial court imposed cumulative fines on the trucking and supply companies for their dual convictions under &sect; 39:3-20b and &sect; 39:3-84b. The appellate division affirmed the convictions on appeal. The court granted appellants' petitions for certification and affirmed in part and reversed in part to modify the judgment of the appellate division, to the extent that it permitted cumulative fines for violations of both &sect; 39:3-20b and &sect; 39:3-84b. The court ruled that the owner of a vehicle registered under &sect; 39:3-20b at the maximum weight was guilty of violating that section by operating in excess of that weight. However, the cumulative imposition of penalties for violations of &sect; 39:3-20b and &sect; 39:3-84b was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, and held that an owner of a vehicle registered at the maximum weight limit, operating in excess of that weight, could be found guilty under the registration law. The court also ruled that the state could not cumulatively punish offenders that violate the commercial motor vehicle registration requirements and the excess-weight law, and remanded for corrective assessment of penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's convictions for robbery, aggravated assault, and unlawful possession of a weapon. Appellant sought review, contending that the prosecutor's cross-examination regarding the contents of his original notice of alibi, which named his roommate to support his alibi defense, violated his right against self-incrimination. Appellant also contended that it was plain error for the trial court to allow the prosecutor to comment on defendant's failure to produce his roommate as an alibi witness. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that when an alibi defense was asserted and a notice of alibi was filed, the information in that notice was subject to cross-examination. Additionally the court held that the prosecutor's comment on appellant's failure to produce a witness, while offensive, was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borrowers had financed housing projects through a predecessor of appellee New Jersey Housing Mortgage and Finance Agency. Appellee adopted a rule, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 80-5, to regulate transfers of financed projects, and passed three regulations that appellants challenged on contractual, statutory, and constitutional grounds. The lower court struck down only one of the regulations. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that all three regulations were invalid. The court held that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 80-5.9 imposed closing fees that had no rational relationship to appellee's costs. The court found that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 80-5.10, which prohibited repayment without prior approval, was invalid because it had no standards to govern the discretion by which appellee would grant approval. The court held that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 80-5.8, which placed an eight percent cap on the return of equity, was invalid because it was inconsistent with the enabling legislation and also because appellee's memoranda showed that its true purpose was actually to regulate mortgage prepayment and not to cap equity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of the lower court decision invalidating a regulation imposing closing fees because the fees were arbitrary and exorbitant. The court reversed the lower court in part and held that the prepayment approval regulation was invalid because it had no standards to guide the use of discretion; and held that the equity cap regulation was invalid because it violated the enabling legislation and had an ulterior purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Advisory Opinion 33-1981, appellant New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission decided to allocate to the gubernatorial candidate's expenditure limit a percentage of advertising expenditures made by a non-gubernatorial candidate of the same party that mentioned or advocated the election of the gubernatorial candidate. By virtue of AO 33-1981, sums of money spent by non-gubernatorial candidates would be allocated to the gubernatorial candidates and charged against their expenditure limits as if the gubernatorial candidates spent the money themselves. The effect, given the statutory limit on total permitted gubernatorial expenditures, would be to reduce, by that amount, the sum permitted to be spent on the gubernatorial candidate's own campaign. The validity of AO 33-1981 was questioned by respondents, candidates for the legislature and the governor's campaign committee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to a nursing home with his brother, then robbed, raped, and murdered a nurse. The brother reported defendant's actions to the police a few days later. During the trial, summation, and sentencing phase, the prosecutor emphasized the brutality of the crime and the good character of the victim. The trial court denied defendant's pre-trial motions to allow attorney-conducted voir dire, to permit questioning on racial prejudice, to use a struck jury system to exercise peremptory challenges, and for more peremptory challenges. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. The court reversed the conviction and death sentence, finding that the voir dire was inadequate, forcing the defense and prosecution to exercise their preemptory challenges in an uninformed manner, and leaving the trial court unable to fairly evaluate the jurors' fitness to serve. The inadequate voir dire, combined with the trial court's failure to excuse one juror for cause which led to defendant's loss of a peremptory challenge, impaired defendant's right to an impartial jury to the extent that it compelled the reversal of the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the murder conviction and the death sentence, finding that the trial court failed to assure that the jury was impartial and that there was reversible error during the penalty phase with respect to the jury instructions. The inadequate voir dire combined with an erroneous refusal to dismiss a juror for cause created the loss of a peremptory challenge and required reversal. The court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Atlantic County (New Jersey), which convicted him of conspiracy to commit burglary, burglary, conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery, aggravated assault, felony murder, and purposeful or knowing murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant argued that he could be subjected to the death penalty only if his conduct, standing alone, resulted in the victim's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary, burglary, conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery, aggravated assault, felony murder, and purposeful or knowing murder and was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed all of the convictions except the capital murder conviction. The court held that on state constitutional grounds, a defendant who was convicted of purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury resulting in death under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2), or either of them, as opposed to one who was convicted of purposely or knowingly causing death, could not be subjected to the death penalty because imposition of the death penalty was irrational and grossly disproportionate to the crime charged. The court also held that a sentencing court or jury in a capital murder case could not consider a co-defendant's sentence as a mitigating factor under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3(c)(5)(h). The court found that while the imputation of liability for the conduct of another sufficed for a murder conviction, the defendant's own conduct in the commission of the murder was a prerequisite to imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for conspiracy to commit burglary, burglary, conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery, aggravated assault, and felony murder, but reversed and remanded his conviction and death sentence for purposeful or knowing murder. A defendant convicted of purposely or knowingly causing serious bodily injury resulting in death was subject to imprisonment and not the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions but reversed the death sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing. The court held that in view of the repetitive and highly inflammatory quality of the evidence of defendant's past misconduct that came before the jury in the penalty phase, both derivatively through the guilt phase and in the cross-examination of defendant's penalty phase witnesses, the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the limited relevance of this evidence was so clearly prejudicial that it required defendant's death sentence to be set aside. The court also found that misconduct on the part of plaintiff prosecution during the penalty phase of the trial required the reversal of defendant's death sentence. That misconduct consisted of improper comments, including the prosecutor's comment to the jury that it was not responsible for deciding the death of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Superior Court Mercer County (New Jersey), which convicted defendant under the Capital Punishment Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3, and found that the aggravating factors that the murder was committed during a felony, and that the murder was outrageously or wantonly horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, outweighed the mitigating factors, and sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the brutal murder of a 75-year-old woman in which the victim was burned, strangled, stabbed and strapped to a bed and assaulted. Defendant was convicted of knowing and purposeful murder, burglary, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, and robbery. At the penalty phase the jury found two aggravating factors: N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3c(4)(g), that the murder was committed during a felony, and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3c(4)(c), that the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated assault of the victim. Defendant was sentenced to death pursuant to the capital punishment act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3. On appeal, the State agreed that a retrial of the penalty phase was required because the jury charge failed to comply with the requirement that to impose the death penalty the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the statutory aggravating factors of &sect; 2C:11-3, outweighed the mitigating factors. The court affirmed the convictions based on the evidence of experts on bodily fluids and the proof that defendant had the required mental state to justify conviction.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had moved but left the children with defendant for two years, and she sought custody again.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two years prior to this ruling, plaintiff wife had been denied permission to move to another state with the children from her marriage to defendant husband. The trial court found that although the move would have been beneficial to plaintiff, she had not shown that the same benefits were not available in New Jersey, nor had she established that it was in the best interests of the children to be away from defendant. Plaintiff moved, and the trial court gave defendant residential custody of the children. On appeal, the court held that focus should not have been on the benefits that would have accrued to plaintiff in the move but on the best interests of the children and on the preservation of their relationship with defendant. The court held that plaintiff needed only to establish a good-faith reason for the move. The court found that defendant's visitation rights would not have been substantially affected by plaintiff's move and held that she should have been permitted to move with her children. In reversing and remanding, the court held that because the children had lived with their father during the last two years, the issue on remand was their best interest at the present time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the appellate court's order, which had denied plaintiff wife permission to move to another state with the children from her marriage to defendant husband. The court held that the original ruling should have permitted plaintiff wife to move out of state, and issue on remand was to be which custodial arrangement was in the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and death sentence for murder under N.J. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2a, from the Superior Court of Morris County (New Jersey). Defendant argued that the death penalty was unconstitutional, and the trial court's refusal to permit the defense to question the jury during voir dire was prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:11-3a(1)-(2), kidnapping, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:13-1b, and aggravated sexual assault, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2a, and received a death sentence. The court affirmed the convictions. The court found no reason to conclude that prosecutorial discretion in the administration of the death penalty was being abused or that it had resulted in an unconstitutionally arbitrary scheme of selection of cases for capital prosecution. The court found that defendant consented to a seizure of his vehicle and evidence obtained during a subsequent search was admissible. The court found that the trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion for a change of venue because the voir dire in the case indicated no hostility to defendant by the jurors who served in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not be laid aside. Because the trial court erred during sentencing when it required that mitigating factors must outweigh aggravating factors in order for a sentence less than death to be imposed, and that the jury had to agree unanimously on the existence of a mitigating factor, the death sentence was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his jury conviction of murder and sentence of death from the Superior Court of Monmouth County (New Jersey) challenging the application of the death penalty statute due to his status as a minor at the time of the offense. Defendant also argued the trial court erred by not suppressing his confession and that prejudicial mid-trial publicity undermined his right to trial by a fair and impartial jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. While being interrogated by the police, defendant invoked his right to cut off questioning, but the interrogation continued as if nothing had happened. The court held the police did not scrupulously honor defendant's exercise of his right to cut off questioning. The police violated his rights, and his confessions were erroneously introduced at trial. Defendant also claimed prejudicial mid-trial publicity undermined his right to trial by a fair and impartial jury. Due to the highly prejudicial nature of the information contained in newspaper articles about the trial, and the realistic possibility that it reached the jurors, the trial court's refusal to poll the jury violated defendant's fair trial rights and required a new trial. Defendant sought to bar the &quot;death qualification&quot; of the jury on the ground that application of the death penalty to defendant was cruel and unusual punishment. The court held the death penalty statute exempting juveniles applied to defendant. The court concluded defendant could not receive the death penalty since he was a juvenile at the time of the murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were reversed and remanded for new trial. The introduction of defendant's confession at trial violated his constitutional rights because police did not honor the exercise of his right to cut off questioning, and his rights to a fair and impartial jury were violated by the jury's potential exposure to prejudicial mid-trial publicity. It was not the intent of the legislature to have juveniles eligible for capital punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to assaulting, raping, robbing, and killing a woman. He was convicted of murder, N.J. Stat.

The trial court sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court held that defendant's confession was voluntary and that his stated desire to lie down and think about what happened was not an invocation of his right to cut off interrogation. The court held that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that their findings on the existence of mitigating factors had to be unanimous. The court held that the jurors should have been permitted to determine individually whether mitigating factors existed and whether they were outweighed by the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and then unanimously agree on the imposition of the death penalty.

Admin. Code tit. 10:82, &sect; 5.10 (1987). The court affirmed the decision of the lower court which upheld the regulation and found that the regulation was consistent with the goals of the state Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:10-1 et seq., of which the EA program was a part. The court noted that the reason for imposing the time limit was to move children and their families out of welfare hotels and other temporary housing and into a more permanent environment. The court also found that other programs existed to pick up where the EA program left off. The court also recognized that because of the myriad, extraordinary and complex factual issues presented and because of the limited ability of the court to control operations of the other branches of government, particularly with respect to appropriations, the court was hesitant to invalidate a legislative program and its attendant regulations before the program had a chance to be tested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent citizen brought an action against appellant township in which respondent sought a declaratory judgment that appellant's ordinance regulating the use of billboards was unconstitutional. The trial court rejected respondent's argument, but the appeals court held that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional. The court affirmed the appeals court. The court stated that it was clear that an issue involving the constitutionality of the ordinance was properly presented. The court stated that because the exercise of U.S. Const. amend. I rights and freedom of speech were at stake, appellant could not seek refuge in a presumption of the ordinance's validity. The court held that appellant had not presented adequate evidence that demonstrated its ordinance furthered a particular, substantial governmental interest, and that its ordinance was sufficiently narrow to further only that interest without unnecessarily restricting freedom of expression. The court concluded that appellant had consequently failed to demonstrate a basis for upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Bureau of Rooming and Boarding House Standards imposed a penalty upon respondent charitable organization for failing to comply with the fire safety provisions of the Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979 (act), N.J. Stat. Ann. 55:13B-1 to -21. Respondent contested the penalty as inapplicable to charitable organizations. The lower court agreed and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the lower court's judgment and found that the state had a legitimate concern for the regulation of fire safety in boarding houses as the residents were typically elderly, disabled, and poor, many of whom needed protection from building hazards. The court held that legislative intent appeared to not exclude all boarding facilities owned and operated by non-profit religious organizations as the one amendment to the act excluded only a certain group. Finally, the court held that appellant was entrusted to pursue the least restrictive means to achieve the state's concern and absent a finding that appellant unnecessarily intruded into respondent's religious affairs, the provisions of the act would apply to respondent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment in favor of respondent charitable organization in its claim that appellant's statutorily imposed penalty was inapplicable was reversed and remanded on the grounds that the statute's application did not exclude respondent and that facially the statute did not unduly interfere with respondent's free exercise of religion or create an excessive state entanglement with religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant oil companies were held responsible for groundwater contamination in a certain residential area and were ordered by appellee Department of Environmental Protection to fund construction of an alternate water supply or be subjected to treble damages. Appellants sought review and filed a motion for a stay of the order, but the motion was denied. The lower court, however, enjoined imposition of treble damages. On appeal, appellants challenged the constitutionality of the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58:10-23.11, asserting that the treble damages provision violated their due process rights because it served to deter judicial challenge to state action. The court affirmed the directive after modifying it, holding that the treble damages did not have to be assessed if the party opposing such damages had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that the directive was either invalid or inapplicable, and that a decision by appellee to seek treble damages would be subject to judicial review. The directive issued by appellee complied with the statute and the provisions ordering payment of removal costs were valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed his conviction for first-degree robbery, a Graves Act offense under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:15-1, in which appellant used or possessed a firearm. He alleged that he was not notified that an extended term would be sought by the state and was denied a hearing on whether there was a prior conviction for a Graves Act offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state convicted appellant of a Graves Act offense: first-degree robbery, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:15-1, in which appellant used or possessed a firearm. The state contended that appellant had been convicted of a prior Graves Act offense, and, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7(a) and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7(c) and without prior notice to appellant, the state sought an extended sentence for appellant's offense. Appellant learned of the imposition of an extended sentence during sentencing and requested a hearing, which the trial court denied and the lower appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the matter and found that the statute clearly required notice and hearing before the imposition of a mandatory extended term based on a prior Graves Act conviction. The court held that in light of the clear statutory mandate, it was insufficient for the state to rely upon a presentence report indicating a prior conviction and the relative passivity of appellant at sentencing to support the imposition of the extended term without prior notice and hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction was reversed and remanded on the grounds that fairness dictated that the state comply with the clear terms of a statute requiring prior notice and hearing before imposing a mandatory extended sentencing term regardless of whether there was a presentence report as to a prior conviction and whether appellant remained silent during sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners challenged a zoning ordinance, Long Beach, N.J., Code 81-1C, that was enacted shortly after negotiations with appellee township failed over the purchase of appellants' property. The lower court held that the ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary, and void as unconstitutional. The appellate court reversed the decision because of the enactment of a later ordinance that was passed to correct defects. The court reversed the appellate court and remanded for review of the new ordinance, but the appellate court found that the new ordinance had a valid zoning purpose and again reversed the finding of the lower court. On further review, the court reversed the decision and remanded to the lower court. Appellee's attempt to link the reduction of lots to the designation of open space in a master plan by using the ordinance was nothing more than a red herring to divert attention from the true purpose of the ordinance, which was to reduce the number of lots as a means of reducing the fair market value of appellants' property.
