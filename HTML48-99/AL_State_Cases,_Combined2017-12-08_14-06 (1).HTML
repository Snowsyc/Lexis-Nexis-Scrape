</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the state and the public service commission (commission), sought review of a decree of the circuit court of Montgomery County (Alabama), which set aside the commission's denial of appellee phone company's scheduled intrastate rate increases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The phone company filed with the commission a proposed new schedule of increased rates and charges for its Alabama intrastate telephone service, including both local service and intrastate toll service. These rates were to become effective on February 21, 1954. The commission, acting pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 48, &sect; 54 (1940), suspended the operation of the proposed new rates for a period of 60 days in order to investigate their reasonableness. Thereafter, the commission entered its order denying the company's petition for an increase in rates. The company appealed. The circuit court found in favor of the company. The state and the commission appealed. The court reversed and held that the commission must in good faith give consideration to the element of reproduction cost as some evidence of the value of a utility's property for rate-making purposes. The commission did not consider this element to have any weight in its determination of the reasonable value of the company's property. On remand, the commission must take this into consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decree of the circuit court and remanded the action to the commission for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant litigant challenged a final decree from a trial court (Alabama) denying declaratory relief with respect to the constitutionality of a statute passed by the Alabama Legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant's bill of complaint had alleged that the statute was violative of Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 22, 45, and 106. In his prayer for relief, the litigant requested the court to declare the statute unconstitutional and void. The litigant filed with the court a brief stating the basis of the appeal. The court refused to hear the litigant's appeal. Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 166 (1940) required any party who requested declaratory relief, alleging that a statute was unconstitutional, to serve the State's attorney general with a copy of the proceeding. Moreover, under Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 166, the attorney general was entitled to be heard. The court reviewed the record and found no evidence revealing that the attorney general was ever served with a copy of the proceeding. Failure to serve the attorney general was a jurisdiction defect. Because the absence of appellate jurisdiction was clear on the face of the record, the court was required to take notice of the lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the Circuit Court of Benton, (now Calhoun.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tried before the Hon. William M. Brooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prisoner, Larkin Bramlett, was indicted at the fall term, 1853, of the circuit court of Cherokee, for the murder of Benjamin F. O'Bannon; was arraigned at the same term, and pleaded not guilty. After several continuances, the cause was removed, on the application of the prisoner, to the circuit court of Benton, now Calhoun county, where a trial was had at the November term, 1857, which resulted in his conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict of the jury, as appears from the bill of exceptions, was in these words: &quot;We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, as charged in the bill of indictment, and assess capital punishment.&quot; When this verdict was returned, &quot;the court asked the jury, if they intended by their verdict that the prisoner should suffer death; and suggested that, if such was their verdict, they had better change it, so as to insert the word 'death,' instead of 'capital punishment.' Thereupon all the jury orally responded, that they had found by their verdict that the prisoner should suffer death; and forthwith struck out the words 'capital punishment,' inserted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the word 'death' in the place thereof, and returned said verdict, so altered, into court. Said verdict was thereupon received by the court, and ordered to be entered of record, [in these words:] 'We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, and that he must suffer death.' The prisoner objected to this; but the court overruled the objection, and the prisoner excepted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The certified transcript, sent by the circuit clerk of Cherokee, to the court in which the trial was had, purported to contain &quot;a full, true and complete transcript of all the orders and entries, as stated of record,&quot; in the cause, &quot;together with a true copy of the original bill of indictment&quot;; but did not show the organization of the grand jury by which the indictment was found. The record does not show that the prisoner raised any objection, during the progress of the trial, to the sufficiency of the transcript; but the bill of exceptions states that, after conviction, he moved the court &quot;to set aside the verdict, and arrest the judgment, on the following grounds: 1st, that the circuit court of Benton has no jurisdiction of the case; 2d, that no grand jury was summoned, charged and sworn, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  before and upon the finding of the indictment; 3d, that it does not appear by the record in said cause that any grand jury was ever summoned, charged or sworn, on or before the finding of the indictment; 4th, that the transcript of the record from the circuit court of Cherokee does not contain any caption of the grand jury who found the bill of indictment; 5th, that said transcript of the record is defective; 6th, that there is no bill of indictment, or properly certified copy of an indictment, in this court; 7th, that there is no legal evidence to this court that there is any bill of indictment against the prisoner; and, 8th, that the judgment is not authorized by law.&quot; On the hearing of the motion, the prisoner produced the certified transcript, containing the defect above named, &quot;which was the only transcript in the court; and thereupon the court refused to pass upon said motion, and suspend its judgment, and ordered that the clerk of the circuit court of Cherokee be ordered to send down to this court a full and complete transcript in said cause; to all of which the prisoner objected, and excepted to the overruling of his objection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a subsequent day of the term, &quot;and after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the sentence of the court had been passed upon the prisoner,&quot; the solicitor produced another certified transcript from the records of the circuit court of Cherokee, showing the organization of the grand jury in that court. &quot;The defendant objected to the same, because it was illegal and irrelevant; because it was no part of the records in this cause; because it was not a paper belonging to this court; because it was not properly on file in this court; and because it was not made out, certified, or filed in this court, until after the trial of said cause, and after said cause was ended; and because the same was not properly certified. The court overruled all these objections; the transcript was read, and the defendant excepted. The court then overruled the motion in arrest of judgment, and the defendant excepted.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged tavern operator was identified as such in an article in the newspaper and charged with planning, in concert with others, to petition or influence the city commission to &quot;unionize&quot; its policemen, firemen, and other city employees. The alleged tavern owner contended that the article was libel per se. The trial court sustained the newspaper's demurrer and the alleged tavern owner appealed. The appellate court affirmed. The court held that the words in the article were not libel per se. The article did not charge that the alleged tavern operator was opposed to all government. The conduct imputed to him did not constitute an indictable offense, and the court was unable to conclude that the charge of such conduct tended to bring the alleged tavern operator into public hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or charged an act odious and disgraceful in society. While some of the words used were harsh and not calculated to endear the newspaper to the subjects of the article, the publication complained of was not libelous per se.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that there was no reasonable basis for construing the authority given to a judge by &sect; 489 as authorizing him to order production of documents by a party or by a person who was not a party for inspection by a party in advance of trial. The court further found that the purpose of &sect; 489 was to provide for the production at the trial of documents in possession of a witness for use as evidence in the trial; it did not contemplate the production of documents in advance of trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought suit against the lending company and its partners, seeking a temporary injunction to restrain them from making contracts at a usurious rate of interest in violation of Ala. Code tit. 9, &sect; 60 (1940). The trial court rendered decrees overruling the lending company and its partners' demurrer to the bill and granting the temporary injunction. The court affirmed, determining that the lending company and its partners were properly enjoined from deliberately charging highly usurious rates of interest on short term small loans made to necessitous borrowers, who were largely ignorant and not advised of their legal rights and were not able to employ counsel to represent them, because the activities were against the public policy of the State. The State did not have an adequate legal remedy under the Harris Act because the activity that it sought to enjoin was not violative of the Act, and the sanctions of the Act could not be used to suppress them. The trial court, acting in equity, had the authority to prohibit the lending company from using the courts in collecting more than the principal amount of the obligations by invoking Ala.

The jury acquitted him of the first charge and found him guilty of possession of an ingredient. Defendant appealed, and the court of appeals certified the question of the constitutionality of that portion of &sect; 369. The court determined that the statute arbitrarily pronounced as unlawful all possession, whether innocent or criminal, of any ingredient for the purpose of making stink or tear gas bombs. No standards of conduct were set up to guide the innocent or warn the criminal, or to advise a defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation or to guide the courts in administering that provision of the statute. To make the possession of a commonly used stink or tear gas bomb ingredient for the purpose of making such bomb a crime, was so vague and uncertain as to be disproportionate to the evil sought to be suppressed and was condemned as an unwarranted abuse of the police power of the state and offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and to Ala.

The organization then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. The court denied the writ and dismissed the petition. The court stated that an order requiring the production of evidence in a pending matter could be reviewed by mandamus. Therefore, the organization was entitled to certiorari only if the contempt order was void on its face. The court concluded that the fines were valid because the organization was found to be in civil, not criminal, contempt. Therefore, the limitations on punishment contained in Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The license was imposed by Demopolis, Ala., General License Ordinance &sect; 169 (1951).

The court affirmed the judgments, finding that the licensee tax was a revenue measure and that the amount of the tax was not so unreasonable and excessive in amount as to be confiscatory and prohibitory. The court noted that when determining whether a revenue tax was confiscatory or prohibitory, it was important to consider: The populousness of the municipality, the profitableness of the business, the character of the business proposed to be licensed and its effects upon the community, and the additional expense necessarily entailed by a police supervision of the business. The court explained that the power to license a privilege implied the right to fix the amount of the fees and that the action of a municipal body in fixing a fee was only to be disturbed in cases of manifest abuse of that power.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer cross-appealed the portion of the circuit court's ruling with respect to the assessment of the use tax on one of the tugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Department of Revenue made a final assessment of use tax on equipment purchased outside of Alabama by the taxpayer. The circuit court held that the taxpayer was not liable for use tax on any of the barges but was liable for the assessments on the three tugs at issue. The State appealed and the taxpayer cross-appealed the ruling as to one of the tugs, which was used. The court affirmed. The court held that the Sales Tax Act and the Use Tax Act were required to be construed together and because the barges were not purchased within Alabama, and therefore not subject to the sales tax, they also were not subject to the use tax. To hold otherwise would have been a clear discrimination against the taxpayer's interstate sales transactions. As to the taxpayer's liability for use tax on the used tug, the circuit court correctly held that the tax was properly assessed. The tug was concededly an &quot;automotive vehicle&quot; and an amendment to Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 788 (1951) clearly extended the operation of the use tax to include used automotive vehicles. As such, the court found an implied repeal of Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 789(u), which exempted used automotive vehicles from the tax.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 51, &sect; 140 (1940).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that former Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 579 (1947), under which the punchboard tax was assessed, authorized a lottery in violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 65 (1901), that its repeal in 1953 without a savings clause meant no tax was due, and that it deprived him of due process of law. The court affirmed the circuit court's decree, holding that the trial court properly overruled the State's demurrer because one of the causes of action stated by the bill was good. The court held that Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 579 (1947) was not unconstitutional because the court had previously held that it was a revenue measure that did not authorize illegal gambling and the 1947 amendment of &sect; 579 made no material changes affecting its constitutionality. The 1953 repeal of &sect; 579 did not affect the validity of the claim against the taxpayer pursuant to Ala. Const. &sect; 100 (1901) because the amount of the claim had been fixed and was due prior to the repeal. Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 732 (1940), under which the tax was assessed, satisfied due process requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company ran a pipeline operation through several states and had support operations, such as pumping stations, in Alabama. The state argued that the company was subject to the franchise tax by virtue of such operations and its permit to operate in the state. However, all of the company's property and personnel in Alabama were committed to and used solely in interstate business. The trial court thus found the tax invalid because the company was engaged solely in interstate commerce in Alabama in 1952. The court affirmed, finding all of the company's business, activities, and operations in Alabama were carried on solely in furtherance of and were inherent, integral, and necessary parts of the interstate transportation of petroleum products. It was irrelevant that the company had qualified to do business in Alabama and had obtained an annual permit. It did so under protest and only to conduct business in interstate transportation. The court also found that a case involving the company's 1942 franchise taxes was not res judicata for the instant case. That case was settled, and there were no findings with which the court could determine whether the issues in the cases were similar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the evidence showed that petitioner was arrested on the warrant, and on trial was ordered to be released to the New York authorities. The proceeding for his arrest and the order releasing him to the New York authorities were claimed by virtue of Ala. Code tit. 42, &sect; 27 (1940). On the trial of the habeas corpus case, it was agreed in open court that pursuant to &sect; 27, the Governor of Alabama and the Governor of New York entered into an agreement as recited in the statute. Petitioner contended that &sect; 27 was void because it violated the due process clause of the Constitution, and that the order for his release to the New York officers was without legal authority. That contention was denied and overruled, and it presented the only matter shown by the transcript, which was the court's duty to consider on the appeal under Ala. Code tit. 15, &sect; 369 (1940). Upon review, the court found that the trial court properly denied petitioner's contention. Ala. Code tit. 42, &sect; 27 (1940) was not violative of due process.

The sheriff filed a motion to set aside the final decree. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that, in a declaratory judgment action alleging that a statute was unconstitutional, Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 166 (1940) required the state attorney general to be served and given an opportunity to be heard. The court ruled that &sect; 166 was mandatory and jurisdictional; thus, the trial court's jurisdiction was not properly invoked, and its decree was void because the record did not show that the attorney general was served with a copy of the proceeding, or that he had notice of the proceeding or participated in it in any way. The court denied the taxpayer's motion to dismiss the appeal, ruling that the motion was not merely an application for rehearing, but challenged the decree as void on its face and invoked the trial court's inherent power to vacate it. The court found that, when the trial court refused to vacate the decree on the motion, claiming that it was void on its face, the remedy for review was by appeal because the denial was a final decree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, in an indictment, charged defendant with a violation of &sect; 259 by tracking the statute and by alleging that the crime was against the public. The trial court overruled a demurrer of the indictment, and defendant was convicted. The appellate court held that the acts constituting defendant's alleged guilt were not set forth with reasonable certainty. The court affirmed the appellate court's reversal, holding that due process required that defendant be noticed of the true nature of the charges against him. Although defendant was sufficiently informed of the crimes for which he was charged, he was not sufficiently informed of the acts that allegedly constituted the crimes. Because defendant was charged with offenses against the &quot;public&quot; rather than against &quot;persons&quot; did not entitle him to less constitutional protection. The court found that the names of the persons to whom the property belonged had to be alleged, regardless of whether it was a &quot;public&quot; offense. Due process required that a fair hearing be granted prior to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property. A fair hearing was not possible unless defendant was notified of the charges to be defended against.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Other indictments against defendant had been quashed because minorities were systematically omitted from the jury roll. The grand jury and venire in the case on appeal were drawn from a new revised roll, which the commissioners compiled after investigating available sources, such as the city and telephone directories, the list of registered voters, and by personal inquiry and personal contact, to identify qualified minorities who were not exempt. Affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court determined that the trial court properly overruled defendant's motions to quash the indictment and the venire because the indictment and trial were controlled by the revised roll and the evidence failed to show that the jury commission systematically omitted qualified and not exempt minorities because of their race or discriminated against them on that account and thereby deprived defendant of due process or the equal protection of the law. The court held that under Ala. Code tit. 30, &sect; 86, defendant could show that there was no competent witness or legal documentary evidence to support the indictment, but that he could not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the subscriber's demurrer to the telephone company's plea that its action was justified by the police commissioner's order, and the subscriber appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the police commissioner's order did not constitute a defense to the subscriber's claim that termination of her service without proof that she was using her phone illegally was a violation of the telephone company's obligation to provide every subscriber with equal service. A telephone company may not refuse to furnish service because of mere suspicion that it was being used for an illegitimate end, or merely because it received a notice from a law enforcement agency that the service was being used for illegal purposes.

</DIV>

Acts 974, and that the Solomon Bill applied to the association and its members including employees of appellee Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The association also appealed an earlier decree overruling their demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Solomon Bill required public employees to chose between their membership in a union or their rights under the State Merit System. The unincorporated association was an organizing committee of an larger organization composed of affiliated national and international unions, organizing committees, local industrial unions, and industrial union councils. Certain rules governing the unincorporated association were adopted and they set forth the objectives of the association. Those objectives included the creation of an international union and working toward better wages and benefits for workers. The court upheld the circuit court's conclusion that the association was a labor union within the meaning of the Solomon Bill. Testimony by an official on behalf of the association that the association was just a discussion group was undercut by the adopted rules of the association. The court dismissed the association's other appeal as untimely.</SPAN></P>

The Department made an assessment against the taxpayer based upon its own formula that imposed two state income taxes upon one income. The taxpayer brought an action against the State challenging the Department's assessment. The circuit court entered a decree overruling the State's demurrer to the taxpayer's bill of complaint. The court affirmed the decree. Drawing upon judicial interpretations accorded to federal and state laws upon which Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 390 (1940) was modeled, the court held that the Department usurped the legislature's authority by using a standard inconsistent with the statutory purpose of relieving taxpayers of the burden of double taxation.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court then held that the employee had forfeited his job by qualifying as a candidate for public office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had been dismissed for conduct unbecoming a public service employee. On appeal from the dismissal to the circuit court, it was argued that the circuit court had no right to hear the case de novo and substitute its own judgment for that of the director. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The circuit court referred to the many statutes in Alabama that provided for de novo trial in the circuit court on appeal from an order of an administrative board. Trial de novo was not synonymous with original jurisdiction, and, as such, there was no violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 143 (1901). Nor was the appeal de novo violative of Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 42, 43 because the legislature could invest any person with powers of a judicial nature and could likewise authorize an appeal de novo from such proceedings to the circuit court. Thus, the circuit court had jurisdiction of the appeal from the order of the director. Further, the director could prefer charges against the employee under Ala. Code tit. 62, &sect; 330(32) (1940). The court noted finally that through the employee's qualification for a public office, he had forfeited his position pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 62, &sect; 330(45).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the decree of the circuit court, which had held, in part, that the director was not authorized to prefer charges against the employee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's deceased husband had been employed by the city's fire department and died in the line of duty. The trial court awarded her widow's benefits based on the retroactive provision contained within the body of Ala. Code &sect;. &sect; 528(3). The court, in considering the commissioners' appeal and reversing the judgment, noted that Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45 required that each law contained one subject, which was clearly expressed in its title. The purposes behind the constitutional provision were to prevent passage of accurate bills and to fairly apprise the people of legislation that was under consideration. Accordingly, the court agreed with the commissioners that Ala. Code &sect;. &sect; 528(3) violated the constitutional mandate because the retroactive feature of the act was not clearly expressed in its title, nor was it even suggested. Insofar as the retroactive feature of the statute was concerned, the law was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator county superintendent of education appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Colbert County (Alabama), which ruled in favor of defendant county commissioner of public schools in the superintendent's quo warranto action challenging the commissioner's right to hold the office to which he was appointed pursuant to Act 227, Acts of Alabama 1953, p. 293.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 227 sought to abolish the superintendent's position and create in lieu thereof the commissioner's position. The superintendent asserted that the Act was unconstitutional and that the commissioner was unlawfully appointed to his position. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment in favor of the commissioner. The Act did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 105 as that section did not prohibit the passage of local laws merely because the local law was different and changed the status of an elected position. Further, the Act did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 175 because it did not improperly abridge the term of office of the superintendent and did not authorize material and significant new duties and powers of office. While the title of the Act abolished the superintendent's office and created the commissioner's office, this did not mean that it had two subjects within the meaning of Ala. Const. &sect; 45, and the subject was clearly expressed in the title. Thus, the circuit court correctly found that the Act was not unconstitutional, and judgment for the commissioner was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The owner further contended that the State had an adequate remedy at law by criminal prosecution against him. On appeal, the court affirmed the injunction in favor of the State.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grocer brought suit in equity against Chief of Police of the City of Mobile and others to enjoin enforcement of reference ordinance based on the Sunday Closing Law, Code 1940, Tit. 14, &sect; 420. The Circuit Court of Mobile County, Claude A. Grayson, J., entered a decree sustaining a demurrer to the bill, and the grocer appealed. The Supreme Court, Lawson, J., held that the Sunday Closing Law is not unconstitutional on ground that it violates the equal protection Clauses of the state and federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

The grocer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grocer contended that Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 420 (1940), which prohibited merchants and shopkeepers from keeping an open store on Sundays, was unconstitutional. The grocer filed a bill seeking to enjoin the officials from enforcing a municipality's ordinance based upon the statute. The officials filed a demurrer, which the trial court sustained. On appeal, the grocer argued that the statute, as applied to him and others similarly situated, was so arbitrary and discriminatory as to be violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Alabama constitution. The court found that the grocer did not claim that the statute violated constitutional provisions in regard to religious liberty and freedom of conscience. The court also found that the only class of persons prohibited from carrying on business on Sunday was merchants and shopkeepers and they are only prohibited from keeping &quot;open store.&quot; The court determined that the classification of &quot;merchants or shopkeepers&quot; was not an unreasonable classification. Therefore, the court held that the demurrer to his bill seeking an injunction was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1951 Ala. Acts 694 (Act) supplemented the benefits provided for in state law and provided for the poor who were in need of state aid. Under the Act, it was necessary for the county unit having jurisdiction to investigate the financial condition of the applicant's living husband, wife, father, mother, son, or daughter, including their income, and then fix each such relative's liability for contribution to the applicant's support. The applicant's bill sought a decree declaring the Act unconstitutional. The trial court overruled the state officials' demurrer to the bill. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the demurrer should have been sustained. The Act did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 88 because there was no constitutional objection to the legislature creating a duty for family members to support indigents under its police power, that there was no fault in conferring jurisdiction in an equity court, and that it did not unconstitutionally bind persons outside the jurisdiction. The title was not so general and indefinite as to violate Ala. Const. &sect; 45. The Act did not violate Ala.

The court treated the claimant as an adverse party for the purpose of her motion. The court held that Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney contended that the three year statute of limitations to disbar an attorney, Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 24 was applicable. The Board contended that &sect; 24 was unconstitutional because it infringed upon judicial power. The court was not willing to hold that &sect; 24 was not an effective statute of limitations as to proceedings begun and conducted upon Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect; 33. It was competent for the legislature to prescribe grounds for disbarment so long as it did not interfere with the court's inherent power to determine who could practice before it. The reprehensible conduct of the attorney, if there was any, was in receiving the fee and accepting employment to contest a will by one not authorized to do so, and at a time not allowed by law, and writing her that it was not too late when he knew it was too late. The court reversed the disbarment, finding that the inquiry in the attorney's mind evidenced by his correspondence was that there could be produced evidence to support a bill in the nature of a bill of review for fraud or to invoke, as he thought, the inherent power of the probate court. Thus, disbarment proceedings were barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed an action against the clerk for relief regarding the clerk's duty to collect certain fees. The clerk filed a cross-bill asserting he was entitled to the sum of fees he collected. The circuit court sustained the county's demurrer to part of the cross-bill and overruled the county's other demurrers to the cross-bill. The clerk appealed, and the court affirmed in part and remanded. In light of local acts, the clerk was not entitled to collect costs and fees of courts for his own use. It was his duty to collect them and to pay the money into the treasury of the county. He was without right to have judgment or decree for the sum. The claim of the clerk for nonpayment of his salary, a claim triable in a civil action at law, could not be the subject of a cross-bill, unless the legal right asserted arose out of the subject matter of the original bill. Since the case was still pending on the original bill and answer and cross-bill, the court deemed it proper to affirm the ruling on the demurrer to the disputed part of the cross-bill and to remand for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a probate judge, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Alabama), which upheld a decision that convicted defendant of embezzlement under Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a probate judge, filed a claim against the county for fees in connection with defendant's duties and caused the clerk of the court of county commissioners to draw a warrant against county funds for the amount of the claim. Thereafter, the warrant was delivered to defendant and credited to defendant's account at a local bank. Consequently, defendant was convicted of embezzlement under &sect; 127, and after the appeals court upheld the conviction, defendant sought review. Upon review, the court initially rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 127 required intent to defraud. The court also held that &sect; 127's use of the word &quot;converted&quot; required a conversion be knowingly done and that the indictment and the jury instructions had correctly conveyed this requirement. However, the court held defendant could not be guilty of embezzlement under the indictment because defendant had not been entrusted by law with the disbursement of county funds. In so holding, the court noted that the issuance of warrants for the payment of claims was a ministerial duty imposed on defendant, in the performance of which defendant had no discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed that grant, reasoning that the record showed that the circuit court was justified in holding that any action of the Board in sustaining the charges that were brought against the principal was arbitrarily unjust. The court held there was no need to remand the action to the Board for a hearing because the parties presented all of the evidence that they wished to. The court also concluded that the legislature clearly could provide for a review by mandamus to determine if the Board's action complied with the Teacher Tenure Law, Ala. Code &sect; 351 et seq. (1940), and if such action was arbitrarily unjust. The court further noted that the undisputed testimony showed that, rather than embezzling the school's funds, the principal had made an unintentional and honest mistake that he rectified on its discovery, which occurred before a complaint was filed.</SPAN></P>

The association, although engaged in retail sales in the city, refused to pay the license on the ground that it was exempt from it by the provisions of Ala. Code tit. 2, &sect; 129 (1940). The city filed a bill in equity, claiming that &sect; 129 was unconstitutional and violative of Ala. Const. &sect; 221. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the association. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that, under Ala. Code tit. 2, &sect; 129 (1940), the state and its political subdivisions were treated alike, except that the state was permitted to collect a nominal permit fee for the purpose of defraying the expenses incident to the issuance of a permit. The purpose of Ala. Const. &sect; 221 was to prevent the legislature from levying a license tax for the use of the state and at the same time relieve licensees from the payment of all other taxes of like kind to counties and municipalities. The court concluded that the city's bill failed to show that the association was delinquent in the payment of a privilege license and was, therefore, without equity.</SPAN></P>

The court, in affirming the trial court's grant of mandamus, rejected the commissioners' numerous points of error. The court determined, among other things, that the citizen had standing to bring the petition in the name of the State and also found that the commissioners had a clear duty to provide the machines under the provisions of Ala. Code tit. 17, art. 7 (1940). The court also found that the commissioners failed to assert as a defense the fact that some of the voting places allegedly had fewer than the 100 voters required for application of the statute. In addition, the court found that the commissioners were not excused from their duty to provide the machines because of any irregularity in the prior election or the remoteness in time thereof. The court also found noted that the commissioners did not raise as a defense the constitutional barrier, under Ala.

The court affirmed, finding that the proposed plant was neither a permitted use within the city's residential districts under &sect; 1602 nor, by definition, an accessory use because the principal use was not permitted. The county's assertion that it proposed use of the subject property for a governmental function precluded application of the city's zoning code was without merit because Ala. Code tit. 62, &sect;&sect; 710, 711, 712 (1940) made full provision for the enforcement of the city's zoning ordinance, subject only to the limitation that such ordinance be comprehensive in scope and purpose and not in conflict with the laws of the state or the state and federal constitutions.

The court, therefore, concluded that the ordinance ipso facto was inconsistent with state law and ultra vires the power of the board of commissioners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">From an assessment for use taxes made by the State Department of Revenue Paramount-Richards Theatres, Inc. appealed to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County and filed a bill of complaint. The Circuit Court rendered a final decree affirming the assessment after sustaining a demurrer to the bill as amended and the taxpayer appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amended bill is in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the period or periods involved the taxpayer was engaged in the business of operating motion picture theatres at Mobile, Alabama. In computing the assessment against the taxpayer, the State Department of Revenue erroneously and illegally included therein the amounts paid by the taxpayer under license agreement for exhibition of moving picture films and trailer films in connection therewith, which license agreements were made between taxpayer and various motion picture producers located outside the State of Alabama, under which agreements such films and trailers were shipped in interstate commerce by said producers to taxpayer at Mobile, Alabama, and pursuant to which agreements said films and trailers were exhibited or used by taxpayer in the conduct of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said moving picture theatres; after which said films and trailers were returned by taxpayer to said producers by shipments thereof made in interstate commerce from Mobile, Alabama, to the points outside the State of Alabama from which the same were shipped, as required under terms of the agreements relating thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(5) Said films and trailers hereinabove mentioned were shipped in interstate commerce to the taxpayer under bona fide license agreements under which the taxpayer was given no right or option to purchase said films or trailers, but the title to which was retained by the producers; and said agreements were not used for the purpose of effecting any sale of said films or trailers to taxpayer; nor were said films or trailers sold or agreed to be sold by the producers to said taxpayer; that said transactions did not involve, in fact or in law, a sale or agreement to sell said films or trailers to taxpayer; that neither said films nor trailers were in fact or in law sold to taxpayer or purchased by taxpayer; that there was no purchase of said films or trailers by taxpayer within the meaning of the Alabama Use Tax Act; and there was no sale to taxpayer or sales price based&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on a sale to taxpayer of said films or trailers within the meaning of the Alabama Use Tax Act; and that therefore said assessment is erroneous, illegal and excessive in the amount and to the extent of $ 10,039.43, and interest thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(6) That each of the license agreements hereinabove mentioned and referred to were executed in writing; that said contracts or agreements, termed exhibition contracts or license agreements, were between various producers as distributors and the taxpayer as exhibitor, a copy of the form of which contracts or agreements is attached hereto, marked Exhibit 'A' and made a part of this bill of complaint as fully and particularly as if herein set out in full; that each of said agreements was substantially of like tenor and effect; that in each of said license agreements the name or title of the film was designated and the number of consecutive days the lessee or exhibitor was permitted to exhibit the pictures produced by the use of said films was designated and was limited to the day or days said films were permitted to be used for such purpose and the license fee or minimum guaranteed amount to be paid for such use or exhibition was in each instance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  specified with respect to the film, and was in each instance limited to a specific date or dates, usually one day or a series of several days, not extending over a period of more than a few days; and under the terms of said agreement in each instance the taxpayer as exhibitor was required to return said films to the producer, at a point outside of the State of Alabama, from which point said film had been shipped by the producer to taxpayer in interstate commerce pursuant to the terms of said agreement; that each of said producers in license agreements involved in this proceeding were non-residents of the State of Alabama; that each of said license agreements when executed by taxpayer were submitted to said non-resident producers for their acceptance, and upon the acceptance of such agreements and pursuant thereto, the particular photoplay, or trailer film, designated or described in said license agreement was shipped by said non-resident producer to taxpayer as exhibitor and upon the exhibition of said film for the day or days specified with respect thereto, the same was immediately shipped by the taxpayer, in interstate commerce, to said non-resident producer beyond or outside of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State of Alabama; that the amount specified to be paid by the taxpayer to the producers under said agreements was in each instance specified in the terms of said agreement, or the basis for the determination of such amounts was therein specified, as a minimum guaranteed license fee for the exhibition of each film, and in some instances involved the payment of a percentage of the gross receipts derived from the exhibition of such film; that the films were shipped to taxpayer separately, constituting single transactions, and they were not shipped under any long-term agreement calling for any large quantity of film shipments to be delivered at regular intervals or to meet the needs of the taxpayer in the conduct of its business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(7) That prior to and during the period involved herein, all of the motion pictures exhibited by the taxpayer were produced and distributed in the following manner:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) Motion picture producers either in California or New York engaged actors and technicians and purchased negative film stock, which negative stock is a strip of celluloid coated with an emulsion which when exposed to light changes from white to black. This negative stock is exposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  through cameras and photographs scenes enacted by the actors and records contemporaneous sound. This negative stock, after being so exposed, is by the producer subjected to a developing process which fixes the photographic images so that they will not fade or change. This negative is not suitable for exhibition purposes, for light projecting through it will cause the images to appear in reverse on the screen, that is the portion of the screen which should be dark would be light and the portion which should be light would be dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) This negative after development is run through a machine which causes the print to be made on raw stock, which raw stock is similar to the negative stock, except that on it the images on the negative are reversed and the print is suitable for projection. Each day during the period of six or more weeks devoted to photographing a motion picture photoplay, one print is made of all negatives which have been developed, which prints are called rushes. As photographing progresses certain rushes are selected and there is made up from those selected, by joining them together a working print. Upon completion of photographing those portions of the negative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from which the rushes in the working print were printed, are assembled in consecutive order and joined together to make a master negative of approximately 7000 feet. In the case of every motion picture exhibited during the period involved in this suit, the negative of each such motion picture was in most instances delivered by the producer to an independent company which made and sold to the producer prints therefrom, or in a few instances, the producer purchased raw stock and in its own laboratory made such prints itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) In all cases the producer made or purchased several hundred prints of each film or motion picture photoplay. In cases where the producer purchased these prints from an independent printing company, the producer paid to the State of California or to the State of New York, as the case may be, a sales tax at the rate of 2% upon the purchase price paid by the producer to the independent printing company. In cases in which the producer made its own prints, it purchased the positive stock from an independent film manufacturer and paid upon such purchase a sales tax to the State of New York or to the State of California, as the case may be, at the rate of 2% of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the purchase price of such negative stock. In each case whether the print was purchased from the independent printing company or positive raw stock was purchased from an independent film manufacturer, the cost to the producer was approximately 1 1/2 [cents] per foot in the case of black and white motion picture photoplays, or for a picture photoplay of average length a total of $ 105.00, and approximately 5 [cents] per foot in the case of colored motion picture films, or for a picture photoplay of average length a total of $ 400.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) The above mentioned sales of positive raw stock by film manufacturing companies or the finished positive prints by the independent film printing companies to the producer are the only sales made of the prints which were used by the taxpayer in its exhibition of motion pictures during the period involved herein; and each such sale constituted a sale at retail; that the producers were the last persons to whom the property in said films and trailers passed in the course of ownership; that such sales to the producers are not made for resale; that there were in fact no further or other sales of such prints, in that after said prints had been used&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the various exhibitors, including the taxpayer, they were taken by the producer-owners thereof and by them destroyed in smelters for the recovery of the silver contained in the emulsion on said celluloid films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(e) The master negative, after its return to the producer-owner, was always retained by the producer-owner in California or in New York and was not shipped to any other state. This retention lasted in different cases for different periods of time, depending upon the popularity of the exhibition, and in the case of those motion picture photoplays which were not popular, the master negatives were by the producerowner destroyed after a period of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(f) The only article of tangible property which has been received by taxpayer from the producer has been the positive print in the case of each motion picture photoplay exhibited by it. In no case has it ever received any master negative. In all cases the taxpayer maintained insurance against fire on the prints while in its possession at an average value of $ 105.00 for black and white and $ 400.00 for technicolor prints, which in every case represented the approximate actual value of the respective prints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(g) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the event that the tax is measured upon the basis of the sales price of the only retail sale of the tangible property involved, it would in each case be substantially less than the tax assessed on the so-called rental of said films, since the last retail sale price was at the rate of approximately 1 1/2 [cents] per foot for black and white and 5 [cents] per foot for technicolor prints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(h) None of the amounts paid to the producer was actually considered by the parties to be either for the purchase or rental of tangible personal property in that the value, or the retail sale price, of the tangible personal property involved was negligible compared to the amount paid by the taxpayer to the producer for the right publicly to exhibit the motion picture photoplay for profit, which right was granted in the contracts between the producer and taxpayer (Exhibit 'A' hereto attached) and which right is not tangible personal property but a limited license under the copyright of the producer publicly to exhibit the motion picture for profit; that all of the motion picture photoplays, films and trailers shipped to the taxpayer under such license agreements had heretofore been duly copyrighted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the respective producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(i) In each case of the motion picture photoplays exhibited by the taxpayer, the print, the only tangible personal property, was delivered to taxpayer by express from outside the State of Alabama and after being exhibited by taxpayer at one of its theatres in Alabama for a period of usually three days, said print was by taxpayer immediately redelivered by express to the producer's branch office outside of the State of Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(j) Taxpayer does not now and never has acquired any ownership or any interest in any of the positive prints of motion picture photoplays exhibited by it during the period herein involved; and at all times after the producer purchased said print at retail as hereinabove averred, the producer has remained the owner of said print and said motion picture photoplay. It was provided in all agreements between the taxpayer and the producers that in the event any print should be lost, stolen, destroyed or injured in any way between the delivery and the return thereof by the taxpayer, the taxpayer should pay to the producer a sum equal to the cost of replacement thereof at the producers' exchange. Said agreement further provided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that such payment should not transfer title to or any interest in such positive print to the taxpayer or any other party; and in all cases payments under such provision by taxpayer to producer have been at approximately 1 1/2 [cents] per foot for black and white and 5 [cents] per foot for technicolor of positive print injured or destroyed by taxpayer, which represents the retail sale price to the purchaser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(8) Taxpayer alleges that said assessment is erroneous, illegal and excessive for the following reasons or upon the following grounds, separately and severally, namely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) That said Alabama Use Tax Act should not be construed as imposing a use tax upon or with respect to the amounts paid by the taxpayer for the privilege of using or exhibiting films, trailers or advertising matter in the conduct of its moving picture show business, under the facts and circumstances as hereinabove alleged, for the reason that under the terms and provisions of the Alabama Sales Tax Act a tax of 2% of the gross receipts derived from the exhibition of said films, trailers and advertising matter in the conduct of said business is imposed upon taxpayer, and the imposition of such use&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax would constitute an additional intermediary tax, contrary to the true meaning and intent of said statute, and would lead to a construction that would make the levy of such use tax a discriminatory tax against interstate commerce contrary to Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, and would deny to taxpayer the equal protection of the law or deprive taxpayer of property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) That the exhibition of said motion pictures exhibited under and by virtue of said contracts constituted taxpayer's sole stock in trade and the gross receipts of its business (except incidental sales of popcorn, candy and refreshments, upon which sales taxes have been duly paid) were derived solely from admission prices charged for the privilege of observing the exhibition; that upon the gross receipts of said business so derived a tax amounting to two per centum was levied pursuant to Code of Alabama 1940, Title 51, Section 753(b), which has been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) The amounts paid by the taxpayer to the producers under said license agreements or exhibition contracts were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not for the rental or purchase of tangible personal property in that the value of, or the retail sale price, of the tangible personal property involved was negligible compared to the amount paid by the taxpayer to the producer for the right publicly to exhibit the motion picture photoplay for profit, which right was granted in the contracts between the producer and taxpayer (Exhibit A hereto attached) and which right is not tangible personal property but a limited license under the copyright of the producer publicly to exhibit the motion pictures for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) The amount of the assessment against taxpayer is excessive in that the tax measured upon the basis of the sales price of the only retail sale of the tangible property involved is substantially less than the tax assessed in this case on the so called rental of said films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(e) The amount of the assessment against taxpayer is excessive in that the sales price of the retail sale of the tangible property involved, namely the positive prints, to the producers as hereinabove averred represents the full retail sales price of said tangible personal property, and all amounts in excess thereof paid by the taxpayer to the producers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were not for rental or purchase of tangible personal property but that the value, or the retail price, of the tangible personal property involved was negligible compared to the amount paid by the taxpayer to the producer for the right publicly to exhibit the motion picture photoplay for profit, which right was granted in the contracts between the producer and taxpayer (Exhibit A hereto attached) and which right is not tangible personal property but a limited license under the copyright of the producer publicly to exhibit the motion picture for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(9) Taxpayer alleges that the tax imposed by said statute is discriminatory against interstate commerce and therefore in conflict with Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States in that it unduly burdens interstate commerce because there is exempted from said tax property the gross proceeds of sale of which are required to be included in the measure of the tax imposed by the provisions of Article 10 of Chapter 20, of Title 51 of the 1940 Code of Alabama, but there is not exempted from said tax property the gross proceeds of sale of which have been taxed by some State other than Alabama, and in this case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in each instance the gross proceeds of sale of the films or trailers exhibited by taxpayer during the period involved herein had in fact been subjected to sales tax of the State of California and of the State of New York at the rate of 2% thereof, which tax had been paid; that therefore interstate and intrastate business did not reach the markets on identical terms, so far as the effect of the state taxes is concerned; that the cumulative effect of both taxes is discriminatorily burdensome on interstate commerce; and further that said assessment also deprives taxpayer of property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer had a home office in Connecticut. The taxpayer wrote life and accident insurance policies and collected premiums on those policies. The taxpayer sold those policies through independent agents who resided in Alabama. The insurance agents paid all expenses of maintaining an office and securing the policy. The taxpayer exercised no control over how the agents secured the policy. The taxpayer only had $ 1050 of capital in the state. It consisted of furniture and fixtures, typewriters, stationery, and other equipment located in an office in Birmingham. The Department imposed a franchise tax on the taxpayer using an allocation formula based on the premium income and the commissions paid to the agents. The court affirmed. The court held that the method that the Department used to assess the franchise tax was unconstitutional because Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 348 (1940) only allowed the State to assess the tax based on the &quot;capital employed&quot; in the state. The statute did not permit the allocation that the Department used to compute the tax.</SPAN></P>

And remanded the case and order the issuance of a temporary injunction against any further action by the state officials. The court held that the Surety Insurance Fund Act, Ala. Code art. 2, tit. 28, &sect; 338 (1940) declared that its provisions would not be effective until the governor issued a proclamation. The governor did not have the authority to decide the effective date of an act duly passed. This was a delegation of legislative power in violation of Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 43 and 44. Ala.

The board's order was grounded on the determination that the property owner was entitled to a variance from the terms of a new comprehensive zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The new zoning ordinance restricted buildings in the property owner's district to single family dwellings, but the board determined that the property owner was entitled to a variance because of unnecessary hardship. The neighbors argued that the power given by Ala. Code tit. 37, &sect; 781 (1940) to vary the effect of the zoning ordinance in specific cases did not include the power to authorize a nonconforming use. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting the neighbors' assertion that the authority to permit variances was restricted to slight modifications such as height, area, and distance from boundaries. The court also held that &sect; 781 did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to the board. Rather, &sect; 781 gave the board the power to administer and execute the declared policy of the legislature within reasonably clear standards. The court concluded that the evidence supported the trial court's findings that the property owner had suffered an unnecessary hardship, that the spirit of the ordinance would not be violated by permitting construction of the apartment house, and that the construction would not depreciate surrounding properties.</SPAN></P>

When the casting was shipped to that customer, he was billed separately for the pattern and the casting. The state determined a deficiency in the taxpayer's sales tax liability. The taxpayer appealed and the lower court did not sustain the deficiency. The state appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the evidence presented in the trial court was not sufficient to overcome the presumption of correctness of the assessment made by the state and that the trial court erred in vacating and annulling the state's assessment. The court found that the evidence did not show definitely that as to the patterns here involved, the purchaser and the taxpayer had any definite understanding or agreement that the patterns would definitely be moved outside of the state.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled the son's motion to dismiss the father's appeal. There was no requirement in Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 786 (1940) that the appeal be taken by the father's newly appointed guardian. Because the object of the action was to determine whether the father was in fact a person of unsound mind, the father's counsel properly took the appeal on his behalf. It was for the jury to say whether the evidence reasonably satisfied them that the father was of unsound mind. The verdict was not clearly against the preponderance of the evidence. The father was not deprived of any constitutional rights in the proceedings. His property rights were not affected by the adjudication of insanity and Ala. Const. &sect; 11 was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1. Every person, proprietor, owner, operator, lessee or his agent, conducting any tourist camp, tourist court, motor court or motel, in the city shall, at all times, keep and maintain at the main or central entrance or office thereof a book or register in which each and every person or patron occupying any room, or accommodations therein shall inscribe with ink or indelible pencil the name, age and home address of each and every patron or person occupying any such room or accommodations in any such place. Such book or register shall be signed at the main or central entrance or office of any such tourist camp, tourist court, motor court or motel, and not elsewhere on the premises, by each and every patron or person occupying any room or accommodations of any sort in any of the above-named places, and the proprietor, owner, operator or lessee of any such tourist camp, tourist court, motor court or motel, or his agent, shall thereupon write opposite such name so registered, the license number and make of automobile in which such patron or person traveled to such tourist&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  camp, tourist court, motor court or motel, the date and hour of arrival and the room or quarters rented or assigned to such patron or person.</SPAN></P>

When the patron, or occupant, of each room or accommodations so rented or occupied shall quit, surrender, or check out of same, it shall be the further duty of the proprietor of such tourist camp, tourist court, motor court or motel, or his agent, to enter the time of departure of said patron, or occupant, in such book or register opposite the name of such patron or occupant. The book or register of any such tourist camp, tourist court, motor court, or motel, shall be open to inspection at all times by the chief of police, or any police officer of said city, on duty at the time of any such inspection, for a period of two years after the making of each entry in such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  book or register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any person or occupant * * * to occupy any room, or other accommodations in such place, with a member of the opposite sex other than the lawfully wedded spouse or minor child of such person, or occupant, or to have sexual intercourse in such tourist camp, tourist court, motor court or motel with any person other than the lawfully wedded spouse of said person, or occupant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 4.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's assignments of error are that the trial court erred in refusing appellant a temporary injunction enjoining and restraining:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, that provision in section 1 of said alleged ordinance No. 334 requiring the appellant or his agent to write opposite such name so registered the license number and make of automobile in which such person or patron traveled to such tourist court, the date and hour of arrival and the room or quarters rented or assigned to such patron or person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, that provision in section 1 of said alleged Ordinance No. 334 purporting to make the book or register mentioned therein open to inspection at all times by the chief of police or any police officer of the City of Homewood, Alabama, on duty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the time of any such inspection for a period of two years after the making of each entry in said book or register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, that part of section 2 of said alleged Ordinance No. 334 purporting to make it unlawful for any person or occupant of any room or accommodation in appellant's tourist court to have sexual intercourse in such tourist court with any person other than the lawfully wedded spouse of said person or occupant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee's cross-assignments are that the trial court erred in granting a temporary injunction enjoining and restraining the appellee, City of Homewood, from enforcing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, that provision in section 1 of said ordinance No. 334 which requires each&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  person conducting a tourist court in said county to at all times keep and maintain in the main or central entrance or office thereof a book or register in which each and every person or patron occupying any room or accommodation therein shall inscribe in ink or indelible pencil the name, age and home address of each and every patron or person occupying any such room or accommodation in any such place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, that provision in section 1 of said ordinance No. 334 requiring such book or register to be signed at the main or central entrance or office of the tourist court and not elsewhere on the premises of each and every person or patron occupying any room or accommodation of any sort in said tourist court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, that provision in section 1 of Ordinance No. 334 making it unlawful for any patron to occupy or to be suffered, permitted or allowed to occupy privately any room, garage, driveway or other accommodation in complainant's tourist court until the entries allegedly required by said section 1 have been made in the book or register at the main or central entrance or office of complainant's tourist court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, that provision in section 1 of Ordinance No. 334 which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purports to make it the duty of complainant or his agent to enter the time of departure of each patron or occupant in such book or register opposite the name of each person or occupant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifth, that provision in that part of section 2 of Ordinance No. 334 purporting to make it unlawful for any person to occupy any room or other accommodation in such place with a member of the opposite sex other than the lawfully wedded spouse or minor child of such person or occupant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth, that provision in that part of section 4 of Ordinance No. 334 purporting to make it unlawful for the complainant or his agent to rent, lease or let or permit to be used any room or other accommodation in his tourist court more than once between the hours of nine o'clock in the evening and six o'clock in the morning of the next or succeeding day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motel owner filed an action against the city to enjoin enforcement of an ordinance regulating motels. The trial court granted the motel owner a temporary injunction for part of the ordinance but denied a temporary injunction for the remaining portions. Both parties appealed the decree, and the court affirmed it. The court held that the city's right and authority regarding the ordinance rested upon its police power. The court found that the power contained in Ala. Code tit. 37, &sect; 455, was broad enough to secure the object sought to be accomplished by the ordinance. The court noted that the ordinance was more restrictive than the state law regulating motor courts. The court held that it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or oppressive to require the motel owner to keep a register of his guests showing the license number and make of automobiles and the date and hour of arrival. The court found that there were differences between hotels and tourist courts that justified regulations regarding one that were not needed for the other. The court held that the issues regarding where and how long the register was to be kept did not present questions that needed an immediate decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Alabama challenged a ruling from the Equity Court of Montgomery County (Alabama), which overruled the State's demurer to a bill in equity filed by plaintiff power company. The bill alleged discriminatory practices in the assessment of the power company's properties for ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For the tax year 1949, the State assessed the properties of certain railroad, public utility, and other like properties upon a basis of 60 percent of their value for tax purposes, while the property of other taxpayers was assessed upon the basis of less than 40 percent of the fair market value of their property. The power company filed the instant bill in equity, asserting that the assessment was discriminatory and void and violated Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 211, 217, 6, 13, 35, as well as the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. The court agreed with the lower court and the power company. The court held that the use of the word &quot;classes&quot; in the statutes related to tax assessment, Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 1-188 (1940), did not mean that any different ratio of assessment or valuation could be applied to any one species or class as distinguished from the others, but that all must be alike, equal, or uniform. Under Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 211, 217, there could be no distinction between taxpayers with different powers or who owned different kinds of real or personal property because all property had to be taxed at the same rate by whomsoever owned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decree in favor of the power company in the power company's action complaining of the State's tax assessment for the year 1949.</SPAN></P>

The executrix had filed an amended bill for a declaratory judgment and to recover moneys paid to a probate judge, as custodian of county funds, by a testator, under &sect; 161, 161A of the General Revenue Act of 1935, alleging that it was paid under protest and by mistake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 161, 161A of the Act, the compensation of tax collectors were limited to a certain amount and all earnings in excess thereof were required to be paid by a tax collector to the county treasurer, to the county general fund. In compliance therewith, a testator, who was a county tax collector, paid a certain sum over to a probate judge, as custodian of the county funds, representing the excess of fees collected. After his death, his executrix filed a claim with the county board of revenue to recover such sum alleging that the sum was paid under protest and by mistake. The board denied the claim, and the executrix filed a declaratory judgment action. On appeal from an order sustaining respondents' demurrer, the court held that: (1) the testator's claim accrued on the date the money was paid into the county treasury; (2) the claim was filed more 12 months after the money was paid to the probate judge; (3) as such, the executrix's claim was barred under Ala. Code tit. 12, &sect; 118 (1940) because it was filed more than 12 months after the claim accrued; and (4) the claim was not allowed under Ala. Code &sect; 186 (1923), under which reimbursement from county funds was discretionary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought reversal of a decree of the trial court (Alabama), which enjoined the violation of appellee city's comprehensive zoning ordinance. The trial court admitted the ordinance into evidence on the certificate of the city clerk and held that the ordinance did not unlawfully delegate power or violate federal due process and the mandates of equal protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court limited its consideration to the narrow questions of whether or not the ordinance was void as not having been proven to have been duly adopted and as to whether it was unconstitutional. The court adhered to an earlier ruling that the introduction of the ordinance book containing a zoning ordinance, with the statutory certificate under the hand of the city clerk respecting the adoption, publication, and existence of the ordinance, met the burden of proof resting upon the city and made a prima facie case. The court found that City of Guntersville, Ala., Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance &sect; 12A delegated its administration and enforcement to the mayor and other officials, but that this delegation was not a forbidden delegation of power. The court held that Ala. Code tit. 37, &sect; 777 et seq. (1940) gave the city ample power to zone to promote health and general welfare and that a zoning ordinance by necessity must be administered by subordinate officials. The court found that language as to offensive noise, smoke, and other nuisances was not overbroad, and that judicial review of any allegedly arbitrary or discriminatory acts by officials satisfied due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court decree that enjoined the landowner from violation of the city zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives (Alabama) propounded questions to the court as to the constitutionality of a pending bill relating to the levy of an excise tax on gasoline in Jackson County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill was proposed to authorize a tax to be imposed by the governing body of a county to levy a gasoline tax, subject to a voter referendum. The tax proceeds would be used for the county's public roads, public buildings, and bridges. The house requested the court to give its opinion of the constitutionality of the bill and of a proposed amendment. First, the court held that the bill did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 45 (1901). There was nothing in the bill that was not referable to its title. Next, the court held that the fact that the governing body could not levy the tax unless and until there was a vote in favor of the tax by a majority vote did not invalidate the bill. The delegation of the power to tax to the governing body of the county was not the delegation of power to individuals. It left to the governing body the authority to determine whether the tax would be levied even though the election results indicated that the voters approved of the tax. Thus, the proposed bill was not violative of &sect; 212. Third, the court held that a proposed amendment to strike the words &quot;public buildings&quot; was a material departure from the advertisement of the legislation and would violate &sect; 106.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the house's questions by holding that the proposed bill was not unconstitutional, but a proposed amendment was.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the writ.

The court affirmed the decree of the circuit court in part and reversed in part. The courthouse tax produced a surplus and the county diverted funds from the courthouse retirement fund to the general fund of the county. The court determined that there was no basis to collect the tax any further, and that the circuit court acted correctly in invalidating the levy for the then current tax year. However, the court held that when the purpose for which a constitutional tax was levied became accomplished and the money on hand was no longer needed for the original purpose, the legislature was entitled to authorize its use for another purpose where the constitution did not provide for this contingency.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill for declaratory judgment by Horace C. Wilkinson and Thomas E. Skinner against Henry W. Sweet, as Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals. From an adverse decree, respondent appeals, and complainants cross-assign error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill is in pertinent part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. On, to-wit, the 26th day of April, 1947, the said Henry W. Sweet, as Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals, with the approval of the Governor of Alabama, employed the law firm of Wilkinson and Skinner to advise the Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals about a proposed issue of revenue securities in the face amount of $ 4,000,000.00 and to prepare such instruments in writing and perform such other services as in their judgment would facilitate a marketing of said securities. In said contract it was provided,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'That said attorneys shall be paid a reasonable fee for services rendered, to be agreed upon between them and the Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals, and in event they are unable to agree, said fee to be fixed by the Circuit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court of Mobile County, Alabama, plus their reasonable traveling expenses.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. Your petitioners aver that they have fully performed their part of said contract and in the performance of same they prepared needed legislation, which was later enacted by the legislature of Alabama; they prepared a request for the Governor of Alabama to submit to the Justices of the Supreme Court of Alabama for an advisory opinion on said legislation; that they prepared and submitted to said Justices briefs in support of the validity of said legislation; that they prepared the order of the Director for the sale of said securities and the form of said securities and the advertisement for the sale of said securities; the request of the Governor prepared by said attorneys together with a copy of the legislation prepared by them and the form of the order and the securities all set out in an opinion of the Justices reported in [249 Ala. 180] 30 So.2d beginning at page 715.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. In addition, the Department of State Docks and Terminals agreed to furnish prospective purchasers of said bonds with a validating opinion by the law firm of Chapman and Cutler in Chicago, Illinois and it was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  necessary for the plaintiffs to hold a number of conferences with said law firm of Chapman and Cutler in Chicago, Illinois, and to travel to and from Birmingham to Chicago and return for said conferences in order to aid in obtaining an opinion from them respecting the validity of said bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. In the passage of said act through the legislature, the same was amended by adding thereto Section 7 1/2, which is in words and figures as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Not more than $ 2,500 of the amount received from the sale of the bonds authorized by this Act or from any other funds of the State of Alabama or of any board, commission, bureau, or other agency of the State, shall be used or expended in payment for the services of an attorney rendered in any manner whatsoever pertaining to this Act, or pertaining to the issuance of the bonds authorized by this Act.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Said Act was approved on, to-wit, the 24th day of July, 1947, long after the aforesaid contract of employment was entered into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. Your petitioners and the said Henry W. Sweet, as Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals, have agreed that a fee of $ 7,500.00 for services rendered, plus $ 500.38 for expenses actually&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  incurred by them in traveling from Birmingham to Mobile for conferences with the Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals at his request, and for traveling from Birmingham to Montgomery and appearing before the Governor and the State Docks Board at the request of the Director and the Governor, and for traveling from Birmingham to Chicago for conferences with the law firm of Chapman and Cutler, whose validating opinion on the bonds was required by prospective customers, making a total of $ 8,000.38 for services rendered and expenses incurred in connection therewith up to the 23rd day of July, 1947, is fair and reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. Plaintiffs further aver that the Department of State Docks and Terminals called for bids on said bonds which were submitted and opened on, to-wit, the 23rd day of July, 1947. The Governor of Alabama rejected said bids and later called for new bids by advertisement. He and the Director called on plaintiffs to perform additional services under the aforesaid contract of employment including the preparation of the necessary documents in connection with the second call for bids and to hold further conferences with said law firm of Chapman and Cutler&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and to make numerous trips to Mobile, Alabama, and to prepare contracts and agreements between the Department of State Docks and Terminals and the firm of Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach who represented a syndicate of prospective purchasers; that plaintiffs incurred traveling expenses in so doing; and said bonds were sold on December 16, 1947, and plaintiffs further aver that the defendant is ready and willing to agree with plaintiffs on an amount that is reasonable for the additional services rendered and the expenses incurred in connection therewith, but is prevented from doing so by said Section 7 1/2 of said Act 211.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But for the purported addition of Section 7 1/2 to the aforesaid act, known as Act No. 211, the said Henry W. Sweet, as Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals, would pay said law firm of Wilkinson and Skinner the aforesaid sum of $ 8,000.38 and agree with them on a reasonable fee and expenses for said additional services rendered. He claims that said section is a valid enactment and is a limitation on his authority to pay said law firm, and a limitation on the power of the Governor of Alabama to pay or approve the payment of any sum to any law firm in excess&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of $ 2,500.00. The Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals has paid said law firm the sum of $ 2,500.00 and is ready, willing and able to pay them the difference between $ 2,500.00 and $ 8,000.38, if said Section 7 1/2, above referred to, is an invalid enactment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your petitioners aver that said Section 7 1/2 is unconstitutional, null and is no limitation on the power or authority of the Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals or the Governor of Alabama to pay your petitioners the amount it has been agreed is fair and reasonable for services rendered, plus their expenses for the following reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) Said Section 7 1/2 is a subject not clearly expressed in the title of said act as required by Section 45 of the Constitution of Alabama, and, therefore, violates said section of said Constitution and is null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) Said Section 7 1/2 of said Act No. 211 violates Section 22 of the Constitution of Alabama prohibiting the legislature of Alabama from enacting any law impairing the obligation of contracts, in that petitioners' contract with the Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals, which was approved by the Governor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Alabama, was made, entered into and approved and partially performed long before the enactment of said Act No. 211.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) Said Section 7 1/2 of Act No. 211 has no application to a contract for the services of an attorney and approved prior to passage and approval of said Act No. 211.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. The Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals declines to pay your petitioners the difference between $ 2,500.00 and $ 8,000.38, and declines to agree with them on a reasonable fee for the additional services rendered and on a reasonable amount for expenses in connection therewith for the reasons aforesaid, and claims and contends that he is without lawful authority to pay said difference to said law firm because of the alleged limitation imposed on him by Section 7 1/2 of said Act No. 211.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the bill is for a decree declaring:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That Section 7 1/2 in Act No. 211 violates Section 45 of the Constitution of Alabama and is unconstitutional, null and void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That Act&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No. 211 is no limitation on the authority of the Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals to pay petitioners a reasonable fee for services rendered under the contract referred to in the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That it is the duty of Henry W.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court decreed as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cause coming on to be heard was submitted to the Court upon the sworn petition of the petitioners and the answer of the defendant, and same being argued by counsel and understood by the Court, the Court is of the opinion that the petitioners are entitled to the relief prayed for in the petition. It is therefore, Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed by the Court as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That Section 7 1/2 in said Act No. 211 violates Section 22 of the Constitution of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alabama in that it impairs the obligation of an already existing contract between the law firm Wilkinson &amp; Skinner, Attorneys, and the Department of State Docks &amp; Terminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Said Section 7 1/2 being null and void and of no effect is no impediment to the payment of the fee agreed upon between the petitioners and the defendant and is no limitation upon the authority of the defendant to pay the petitioners a reasonable fee for services rendered under the contract set forth in the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. It is the duty of Henry W. Sweet, as Director of the Department of State Docks and Terminals to undertake to agree with the law firm of Wilkinson &amp; Skinner on a reasonable fee for additional services rendered as alleged in the petition and on a reasonable sum to be paid them for expenses incurred for traveling in connection with the performance of their duties under their employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. Inasmuch as the Court has ruled that Section 7 1/2 in said Act No. 211 is null and void because it violates Section 22 of the Constitution of Alabama, it is not necessary to determine whether or not said Section offends Section 45 of the Constitution of Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The costs of this proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are hereby taxed against the defendant.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Director of the State Department of Docks and Terminals sought review of a decree from the trial court (Alabama), which ruled in favor of appellee attorneys in their declaratory judgment action against the Director for fees payable to them under a contract for services in connection with the preparation of an act for the legislature and a bond issue. The trial court ruled that 1947 Ala. Acts 211, &sect; 7 1/2 violated Ala. Const. &sect; 45.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys entered into a contract with the Director, prior to the enactment of 1947 Ala. Acts. 211, to provide legal services to the Department. The attorneys brought a declaratory judgment action, alleging that they had fully performed under the contract but that the Director had not paid them the balance of the contract. The trial court made a declaration favorable to the attorneys and the Director appealed. The court held that the suit was not prohibited by Ala. Const. &sect; 14 because the Director was unsure of his duty to pay out the funds under his control. Although he was a state officer, the suit was for guidance in the discharge of his duties. The court held that 1947 Ala. Acts 211 &sect; 7 1/2 could not serve to impair the contract between the attorneys and the Director in violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 22. The court also held that &sect; 7 1/2 violated Ala. Const. &sect; 45 in that it pertained to a subject that was not mentioned in the caption of Act 211. The exclusion of &sect; 7 1/2 from Act 211 did not affect its validity with respect to the subject included in the caption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's decree to expressing include in the judgment the declaration that it was the Director's duty to immediately pay the attorneys the unpaid balance of the contract. As modified, the trial court's decree was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated movie theaters and as part of its regular course of business it leased films from out of state producers to exhibit in its theaters. As alleged by the taxpayer, the leases were strictly leases and not sales of the films. The taxpayer was obliged to return the films to the producers, and the leases did not contain any purchase options therein. The State assessed use taxes on the taxpayer based upon Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 788 (1940). In challenging such assessment, the taxpayer alleged that the renting or leasing of the films shipped in interstate commerce to the taxpayer did not constitute a purchase of tangible personal property for use or storage or other consumption in the state and that to apply the levy would unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce. The trial court sustained the State's demurrer to the complaint, and the court affirmed. It held that the levy of the tax attached after the act of transportation ended; thus, it rejected the argument that the tax burdened interstate commerce. The court also ruled that the taxpayer did not meet and overcome the prima facie statutory presumption of the legality and correctness of the assessment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statement of the Case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal brings up for review Act No. 424 of Local Acts of Alabama 1947, p. 281 et seq. By said act the legislature levied in Tuscaloosa County license and excise taxes paralleling such taxes now imposed by the general law of the State, with the rate of taxation of 50% of the amount of such State taxes, for the purpose of establishing a public hospital in Tuscaloosa County. Section 8 of the act consecrates the revenue accruing from the taxes exclusively for the establishment, maintenance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and operation of such public hospital to be owned and operated jointly by the two municipalities and authorizes the city and county to issue and sell interest-bearing warrants to be paid solely from these tax revenues. The act further provides that the proceeds of the sale of these warrants shall be utilized for this exclusive purpose and gives authority to pledge for the payment of the principal and interest to be due by said warrants of a per centum of this tax levy, but stipulates that the obligation of these warrants shall not be a general obligation of either the city or the county and shall not be charged to the constitutional debt limit of either municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Act No. 540, Local Acts of Alabama 1947, p. 364 et seq., approved soon after Act No. 424 at the same regular session of the legislature, created the Druid City Hospital Board, &quot;an agency of Tuscaloosa County and the City of Tuscaloosa,&quot; for the purpose of acquiring a site for the constructing, equipping, maintaining and operating of a public general hospital to be owned jointly by the city and county, to be known as the Druid City Hospital, and which board was to receive the revenues from the tax levy under Act No. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  424 and charitable gifts from all sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Act No. 424 was passed, there was a public hospital known as Druid City Hospital being then operated jointly by the city and the county, and after the enactment of Act No. 540 the Druid City Hospital Board, created by this latter act, was organized and thereupon began to operate and is now operating the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original bill also shows that the two municipalities, the City of Tuscaloosa and Tuscaloosa County, through their respective governing bodies, propose (a) to issue and sell interest-bearing warrants as provided in the act in the aggregate amount of $ 1,500,000 as joint obligations of the city and county and payable solely from the revenues to be derived from the tax levied as authorized by the act; (b) to pledge for payment of said warrants so much of the per centum of the revenues derived from said tax, as permitted by the act, as will be necessary for said purpose; (c) to make said payment a first charge on that per centum of the revenues; and (d) to use the proceeds from the sale of said warrants for the purpose of acquiring a site and constructing and equipping the said hospital.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen sought a declaratory judgment that Tuscaloosa, Ala., local act, p. 281 (1947) was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement by appellees, the city, its commission board and its members, the county, its board of revenue and its members, and the county probate judge. The Circuit Court, Tuscaloosa County (Alabama) sustained the validity of the act and denied the injunction. The citizen sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disputed act provided for the issuance of warrants and excise taxes for the building of a public hospital. The citizen claimed that the act was invalid because it made a direct levy that unlawfully invaded the discretion of the county governing body and illegally preempted local authority. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court held that the right of taxation was vested in local authority by state permission and that the act was presumed to have the sanction of the local taxpayers acting through their duly elected representatives. However, the court agreed that the part of the act providing for the issuance of anticipating interest-bearing warrants should have been condemned. The court further held that the remainder of the act was severable and constitutional. The court also rejected the citizen's arguments that the entirety of the act violated the provisions of Ala. Const. &sect; 45. The court found that the subject of the act was clearly expressed in the title, that the act did not improperly contain more than one subject, and that the act did not inappropriately refer to other provisions of the Alabama Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the lower court's judgment that upheld the constitutionality of that part of the act providing for the issuance and sale of warrants; the court rendered a judgment that this part of the act was unconstitutional. In all other respects the court affirmed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill for declaratory judgment by the City of Decatur against Paul Robinson, D. E. Frederick, and Charles H. Eyster, for construction of, and advice with respect to, an ordinance of said city authorizing establishment of parking meter zones and operation of parking meters. From a decree declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and void, complainant appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 5, 1947, the appellant, City of Decatur, entered into a contract with Duncan Meter Corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois, denominated in the contract &quot;The Meter Company,&quot; the city agreeing to lease from the meter company and said company agreeing &quot;to lease to the city, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth 200 more or less Miller Multiple-Coin Parking Meters (hereinafter called 'meters'). The agreed value of the meters shall be Seventy-five ($ 75.00) Dollars per meter F.O.B. Chicago, which includes standard and bell base plus actual advances made by the meter company as hereinafter provided. The city shall at any time have the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  option to purchase the meters by applying the rentals which have been paid in by the city to the meter company against the agreed value of the meter and paying the balance due thereon.&quot; The contract which is denominated &quot;Parking Meter Trial Lease&quot; further provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The Meter Company shall advance all freight, supervision, and installation costs in connection with the delivery and installation of said meters. The installation supervisor will train the City-appointed maintenance man to properly maintain all meters installed under this agreement. The Company furnishes three (3) complete meter mechanisms and one (1) meter housing free for each one hundred (100) meters installed, for service purposes. * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. Payments by The City to The Meter Company shall be solely from the receipts, funds and revenues obtained from the operation thereof and there shall be no obligation on the part of The City to pay for the same from any other source. The manner of payment of rental for said meters shall be as follows: The City shall deduct from the first receipts from the operation of said meters the actual cost of freight, supervision, and installation, and reimburse the Meter Company&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therefor. After the aforesaid deductions, all remaining receipts, funds and revenues from the operation of said meters shall be considered not revenue. Upon the fifteenth (15th) day after the installation of said meters and each and every thirtieth (30th) day thereafter The City shall pay as rental to The Meter Company fifty (50%) percent of the net revenue from all meters so installed until The City exercises its option to purchase the meters and/or The Meter Company has received rentals and reimbursements for advances in the aggregate amount of the agreed value of the meters or until or unless this agreement is terminated or cancelled under the provisions of paragraph five (5) and six (6) hereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The Meter Company extends and grants unto the City the option to terminate this agreement at the expiration of the trial period by giving The Meter Corporation written notice thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of said period; but in that event, The Meter Company shall nevertheless be entitled to receive from The City and to retain as rental for the use of the meters fifty (50%) percent of the net revenue from said meters, as aforesaid, which shall have accrued during that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entire period, and until the meters are removed; and in the event of such cancellation or if The Meter Company shall exercise its right to cancel as provided in paragraph six (6) hereof, The Meter Company will, at the expiration of said period, at its own cost and expense, promptly proceed to remove said meters and repair any damage to the places in the pavements or other premises in which said meters were installed, and all obligation under the terms of this agreement shall cease and terminate, except as herein otherwise provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. If at any time prior to the payment in full to The Meter Company of the agreed value, as aforesaid, of all said meters, rentals to The Meter Company since the installation of said meters, shall have averaged less than three ($ 3.00) Dollars per month, per meter, or if The City shall violate this agreement or default in the full and faithful performance of this agreement, then The Meter Company may at its option cancel this agreement by giving to The City written notice of its intention to do so, and at any time after the tenth (10th) day following the giving of such notice, The Meter Company shall have the right, at its option with or without legal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  process or further notice of any kind, to enter upon the premises where said meters may be installed or kept and remove and retake the same for its own use, and to receive from the City as rental for the use of the meters the fifty (50%) percent of net revenue from said meters as aforesaid which shall have accrued up to the time said meters are removed. Nothing herein contained shall be construed in any way limiting or affecting The Meter Company's right to pursue or enforce any remedy provided by law in the event of a breach of this agreement by the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. If at any time prior to the payments in full to The Meter Company of the agreed value, as aforesaid, of all said meters any taxes are levied on meters, installed, such as personal property tax, sales tax or use tax, such taxes will be advanced by The Meter Company, and The City shall reimburse The Meter Company in full from the gross receipts of the meters, before the net revenue is computed for the purposes of paragraph four (4) hereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. It is understood and agreed that the title to all said meters shall be and remain in The Meter Company until and unless the full agreed value thereof, as aforesaid, shall have been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  paid in cash to The Meter Company, including the rentals aforesaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. The Meter Company agrees that if The City pays it as rentals the full agreed value of said meters as aforesaid, it will deliver to The City a bill of sale therefor, free and clear of all encumbrances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. The Meter Company further covenants and agrees that it is the lawful owner of said meters and that the same are free and clear of all liens, contracts or conditional sales, chattel mortgages, and other encumbrances, and that The Meter Company has a lawful right to lease, dispose of, and sell the same, and that it will warrant and defend its title thereto against all claims whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. The Meter Company agrees to furnish the said meters with a mechanism regulated as to time as shall be mutually agreed to between The City and The Meter Company, and equipped with two slots, if so ordered by The City to receive coins of the denomination of 1 [cent] and 5 [cent], and will be set to allow:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nickel and 1 penny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">84 minutes for 7 pennies,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or, 1 nickel and 2 pennies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">96 minutes for 8 pennies, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 nickel and 3 pennies, or,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or 1 nickel and 4 pennies,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">120 minutes for 10 pennies, or,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 nickels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or at any other available rate combination which may be mutually agreed upon. * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. The City warrants that all necessary and proper steps have been or will be taken by the duly constituted Governmental and Municipal authorities authorizing the execution of this agreement and that all necessary or proper ordinances and/or resolutions have been or will be adopted authorizing and providing for the installation of said meters and the operation thereof, and agrees it will police the said meters after installation, and shall properly enforce all ordinances and resolutions pertaining thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15. The City agrees to set up a special parking meter fund into which all receipts from all meters furnished hereunder shall be placed and kept. No withdrawals from said special parking meter fund shall be made until The Meter Company has been paid the cost of freight, supervision, and installation, and the fifty (50%) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  percent of the net revenue has been paid to The Meter Company as hereinbefore provided, after which The City shall have the right to the remaining fifty (50%) percent of the net revenue to use as they see fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;16. This agreement shall be for a trial period of six months, commencing from the date of complete installation. The City shall have the option at the expiration of said trial period of entering into a further trial period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;17. * * * The Meter Company further covenants and agrees to defend the City in any law suit brought to test the legality of parking meters in the City and to pay all expense of such litigation, including attorneys fees and court costs and in the event the City is prohibited by court order from operating parking meters this contract shall be terminated as provided in section 5 hereof. The Meter Company further covenants and agrees to pay, without reimbursement, all freight and installation costs in excess of $ 3.50 per meter. * * *.&quot; [Italics supplied.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the date of the execution of said contract, excerpts taken from the minutes of the city council state:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. W. Howard Netterville, Southwest Distributor for Duncan Meter Corporation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Chicago, Illinois, was present and discussed with the Council 'Parking Meters.' Mr. Netterville demonstrated and explained the Miller Meter and the contract in detail (Here the contract as approved by the City Attorney is set out in the minutes in full). After some discussion Councilman McRae made a motion, seconded by Councilman Speake, that the City enter into a contract in the foregoing form with the Duncan Meter Corporation and the Mayor, upon the approval of the City Attorney be and is hereby authorized to sign said contract. * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months later, August 5, 1947, the city council adopted and promulgated its parking meter ordinance in pursuance of said contract, which purports to grant and confer on the meter company certain rights and privileges, towit: Section 3 of the ordinance confers on the chief of police of the city the duty to direct and authorize and mark off individual parking spaces in the &quot;parking zones designated and described in Section 2 of this ordinance and in such other zones as may hereafter be established, said parking spaces to be designated by lines painted or durably marked on the curbing or surface of the street. * * *.&quot; Section 4 of said ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 4. Installation of Parking Meters. In said parking meter zones there shall be installed parking meters upon the curb or sidewalk immediately adjacent to the parking places provided in Section 3 of this ordinance, said installation to be placed not more than two (2) feet from the curb nor more than four (4) feet from the front line of the parking space as indicated, and the Chief of Police shall be responsible for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and use of such parking meters. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking upon the deposit of the appropriate coin or coins, lawful money of the United States of America, for the period of time prescribed by this ordinance. Each device shall be so arranged that upon the expiration of the lawful time limit it will indicate by a proper visible signal that the lawful parking period has expired and in such cases the right of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the operator, owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties hereinafter provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 5. Operation of Parking Meters. Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Fire or Police Department, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer or traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any parking space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering the said parking meter space, immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper coin of the United States as is required for such parking meter and as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and as required by the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the deposit of the proper coin or coins, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on such meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon, and failure to deposit such proper coin, and to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required, shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. Upon the deposit of such coin (and the setting of the timing mechanism in operation when so required) the parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the period of time which has been prescribed for the part of the street in which said parking space is located, provided that any&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space adjacent to a meter which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the previous occupant of the space shall not be required to deposit a coin so long as his occupancy of said space does not exceed the indicated unused parking time. If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the parking time set for such parking space, and if the meter shall indicate such illegal parking, then, and in that event, such vehicle shall be considered as parking overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such parking shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 6. Parking Time Limits. (a) Parking or standing a vehicle in a designated space in Parking Meter Zone 'A' shall be lawful for twelve minutes upon deposit of a one-cent coin, twenty-four (24) minutes upon the deposit of two (2) one-cent coins, thirty-six (36) minutes upon the deposit of three (3) one-cent coins, forty-eight (48) minutes upon the deposit of four (4) one-cent coins, or sixty (60) minutes upon the deposit of five (5) one-cent coins or one (1) five-cent coin of the United States of America, all upon the consequent setting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in operation of the timing mechanism on such meter pursuant to the provisions written thereon. * * *.&quot; [Italics supplied.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance makes parking contrary to the ordinance or for a time longer than specified on the meter or failure of a person parking to turn on the mechanism of the meter an offense punishable by fine and imprisonment, one or both, &quot;not exceeding $ 50.00 or by imprisonment not exceeding 30 days,&quot; without specifying where the offender is to be imprisoned, and this penalty applies to any person in whose name any such vehicle is registered, whether or not such person parked the vehicle in such parking space. [&sect;&sect; 7 and 11 of the Ordinance.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1(e) of the ordinance provides: &quot;The word 'park' or 'parking' shall mean the standing of a vehicle, whether or not, upon a street otherwise than in obedience to traffic regulations, signs or signals or an involuntary stopping of a vehicle by reason of causes beyond the control of the operator of the vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1 of the ordinance also provides: &quot;Parking Meter Zones. The following named and described areas, streets, or portions of streets and such other areas, streets, or portions of streets as may&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hereafter be included in this Section by amendment thereto, lying within the corporate limits of the City of Decatur, shall be and constitute 'Parking Meter Zone &quot;A,&quot;' namely: * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this provision the ordinance designates certain portions of Second Avenue East and a part of Moulton Street and a part of Bank Street as parking Zone &quot;A.&quot; And after repeating the last above quoted provisions designates part of Grant Street and a part of Johnston Street as parking Zone &quot;B.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 10 provides: &quot;Use of Funds. The coins deposited in parking meters are required and shall be used to defray the expense of proper regulation, control, and inspection of traffic upon the public streets of the City of Decatur, Alabama; to provide for the costs of supervision, regulation, inspection and control of traffic upon the public streets and to defray the cost of supervising, regulating and inspecting the parking of vehicles in the parking meter zones and the cost of the purchase, supervision, protection, inspection, installation, operation, maintenance, control and use of the parking meters installed hereunder, and the special funds in which such fees shall be placed shall be devoted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exclusively to these purposes.&quot; [Italics supplied.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No provision is made in the ordinance for drive-ins or walkways for use of the abutting property owners as a means of egress and ingress. Such rights or privileges if recognized at all are left to the discretion of the chief of police. (Italicization in the foregoing statement is by the writer for emphasis.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original bill in this case was filed on August 7, 1947, by the City of Decatur to which the contract with the meter company and the ordinance passed in pursuance thereof were attached as exhibits, against Paul Robinson and W. W. Dinsmore, seeking a construction of said ordinance and praying that the court, &quot;advise complainant and respondents whether or not the complainant has the right and authority under and by virtue of said ordinance to make, set up and establish parking meter zones within the limits of the City of Decatur as therein defined and set up, operate and maintain parking meters along or near the curb or sidewalk in said parking meter zones in the manner and mode likewise set out and described in said ordinance attached hereto, and further whether or not the said complainant is authorized and empowered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under and by virtue of the terms and provisions of said ordinance to enforce the parking of vehicles as required and set out in said ordinance referred to and to penalize and fine or imprison as therein provided violators of said ordinance in any particular.&quot; [Italics supplied.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as to the said W. W. Dinsmore that the court &quot;will construe and determine whether or not said ordinance attached as Exhibit '2,' and the establishment of parking meter zones, as herein defined, and the operation and maintenance of parking meters, as therein contemplated, has the effect of and is an unauthorized use of the public street, Second Avenue East, upon which his place of business fronts and abuts and which is in said parking meter zone 'A,'&quot; and for other relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 13, 1947, the bill was amended by striking the name &quot;W. W. Dinsmore&quot; wherever the same appears in paragraphs 8 and 9 and inserting in lieu thereof the names of the respondents &quot;D. E. Frederick and Chas. H. Eyster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 25, 1947, the bill was amended by striking W. W. Dinsmore as a party respondent and by striking paragraph 7 of the bill of complaint and in lieu thereof inserting like allegations as to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ownership of the property by Eyster and Frederick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original bill after alleging that complainants have entered into the contract attached to the bill as Exhibit 2, the substance of which has heretofore been stated, avers that the complainant is a municipal corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Alabama; that Paul Robinson is a resident of Morgan County, and is part owner of premises located at 402 Bank Street upon that part of Bank Street abutting on parking meter Zone &quot;A&quot; designated and defined in said ordinance and exhibit &quot;2&quot; and more particularly described in the bill by metes and bounds. That said Paul Robinson is part owner and operator of the firm known as Robinson Furniture Company established and conducting a going business at said premises into which business house each day many persons from and about the City of Decatur and elsewhere go and come for the purpose of buying or selling goods, wares or merchandise therein and of conducting trade and business with the said Paul Robinson, his agents, servants or employees. That said Robinson on divers and sundry times has asserted and stated in effect that he would contest the validity of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said ordinance and seek to enjoin the operation of said ordinance or any ordinance of such character providing for installation of parking meters and has threatened to file such suit. On information and belief the complainant alleges that Paul Robinson is claiming and contending that the passage and operation of said ordinance and the operation of parking meters as therein contemplated has been held to have the effect and tendency to and does deprive him of his property without due process of law and that said ordinance is an unauthorized exercise of the taxing power invested in the complainants. The bill further avers that Chas. H. Eyster is a part owner and tenant in common of the property described as 100' X 140' in Decatur, Morgan County, Alabama, on the Southeast Corner of the intersection of 2nd Avenue East and Moulton Street (describing the same) as &quot;Lots 9, 10, 11 and 12 of Block 6 of Addition 3 of the Decatur Land Improvement and Furnace Company to Decatur, Alabama, as shown by map or plat of said Addition on file and of record in the office of the Probate Judge of Morgan County, Alabama,&quot; and as such. lets and rents a portion of the same to D. E. Frederick and his associates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  doing business under the firm name and style of &quot;Exchange Furniture Co.,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That D. E. Frederick is part owner and operator of said business known as Exchange Furniture Company and located at No. 209 East Moulton Street, Decatur, Alabama. That D. E. Frederick is the lessee and tenant of Said Chas. H. Eyster. That said Frederick daily conducts and operates said business known and designated as Exchange Furniture Company and into said business house or establishment located on the south side of Moulton Street between Second and Fourth Avenues, East, in Decatur, Alabama, and in front of which a parking meter zone known as Parking Meter Zone &quot;A&quot; has been established, many persons from and about Decatur go and come each day for the purpose of buying and selling goods, wares or merchandise, and of conducting trade and business therein with the said D. E. Frederick, his associates in business, his agents, servants or employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On information and belief the bill further avers that Eyster and Frederick contend that the passage and adoption of the said ordinance and its operation and effect tends to and does deprive them of their property without due process of law and is an obstruction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of free ingress and egress in and to the property described; and is an unauthorized exercise of the taxing powers vested in the complainant; that said Eyster and Frederick each contend that the establishment and operation of a parking meter zone in front of, abutting or adjacent to the property above described is an unauthorized use of the public highway or street by reason of a provision written into the dedication of said street by the Decatur Land Improvement and Furnace Company, the owners of said land upon which the property and streets were situated at the time of the dedication thereof by preparing and filing a man delineating lots, blocks and streets and having the same recorded in the office of the Judge of Probate of Morgan County, Alabama, in the year 1887, containing the following reservation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * 'The Decatur Land Improvement &amp; Furnace Co.' hath dedicated the said streets, avenues and alleys to and for the use of a highway but the same are not to be used for other purposes without the consent of the said 'Decatur Land Improvement &amp; Furnace Co.' nor must the said alleys and avenues be used for the construction and operation of said Street railways therein or thereon, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nor for laying the water mains or water pipes or gas pipes or for the erection and keep up the post and wire for electric lights without the consent of the said Decatur Land Improvement &amp; Furnace Company and with this reservation the said plat or map is acknowledged and certified. * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar dedication was alleged as to property owned by Robinson on Bank Street in &quot;Old Decatur&quot; territory in 1877.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants Robinson, Eyster and Frederick filed answer admitting allegations of paragraph 5 to the extent that it alleges said parking meters have not as yet been fully installed, that said meters are in the process of being installed in various portions of said parking meter zones, and that posts or standards to support the meter mechanism have been installed as alleged. It is also admitted that said parking meters and the use thereof as contemplated in said ordinance will produce surplus revenue &quot;that is to say, revenue over and above the amount required to defray the expense of the installation and purchase of said parking meters and the maintenance, supervision, inspection and control, and use of said parking meters.&quot; All of the other allegations of paragraph 5 are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer alleges: &quot;The defendant Robinson, as alleged in paragraph 6 of the bill of complaint, is a part owner of the property described in said paragraph 6 of the bill of complaint, which said property fronts a distance of 25 feet on the westerly line of Bank Street and abuts a distance of 82 1/2 feet on the southerly line of Church Street, which said streets are public streets in the City of Decatur, and the said Robinson owns to the center line of each of said streets, subject to the easement of travel and use of said streets by the public, and the said Robinson conducts a going business on said property and sells thereon goods, wares and merchandise, and his customers and those with whom he does business park alongside of said streets and alongside of said property owned by him, and leave the vehicles so parked by them on said streets while engaged in doing business with the said Robinson, and he and his said customers with whom he does business have the right that said persons and the said Robinson park their vehicles along the curb adjacent to said streets and leave them there, so parked for a reasonable time and subject to valid regulations which may be ordained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the complainant, without the payment of any toll or fee, for the privilege and right of so parking said vehicles. There are various other business establishments in the City of Decatur, some of which come in direct competition with the said Robinson, and which are not within any parking meter zone established by the ordinance exhibited with the bill of complaint, and as to which the complainant had not enacted any ordinance or made any requirement that a fee or toll be paid to the complainant for the privilege of parking vehicles in the streets alongside said business establishments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. As alleged in paragraph 7 of the bill of complaint, the defendant Eyster is a part owner of the property described in said paragraph, which said property fronts upon and abuts on Second Avenue East and Moulton Street, both of which are public streets in the City of Decatur, and the said Eyster owns the property to the center line of each of said streets, subject to the easement for travel and use of said streets by the public, and the said Frederick, together with his associates, is the lessee of said property and conducts a business thereon, under the name and style of Exchange Furniture&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Company, and various customers of the said Frederick and persons with whom he does business, and the said Frederick, have the right to park motor vehicles along the curb of said street, subject to reasonable regulations of the City of Decatur, without the exaction of any toll or fee for the privilege and right of parking said motor vehicles along the curb of said streets. There are various persons in the City of Decatur who do business in the City of Decatur and who compete with the said Frederick and his associates, whose businesses are located alongside of public streets in the City of Decatur and are not within any parking meter zone established by said ordinance exhibited with the bill of complaint, or by any other ordinance enacted by the City of Decatur.&quot; [Italics supplied.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said answer alleges that there are other business properties near or adjacent to the property of defendants in which no parking zones are established and in which automobiles and other vehicles are allowed to park without any toll or fee for the privilege of so parking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the property of the defendant Eyster is located in Addition 3 of the Decatur Land Improvement &amp; Furnace Company of Decatur, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alabama, which was laid off into lots, blocks streets, paths and avenues in 1887, which were dedicated by map filed in the office of the Judge of Probate of Morgan County, Alabama, and lots sold therefrom and further:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defendants further show unto the Court that while said ordinance is couched in language giving it the appearance of an ordinance designed to regulate traffic under the police power of the City of Decatur, said ordinance was enacted for the purpose of obtaining and raising revenue for the City of Decatur. These defendants show further unto the Court that at the time of the adoption and enactment of said ordinance the City of Decatur had in effect ordinances to control and regulate traffic in the territory designated in said ordinance as parking meter zones, which said ordinances then in force and effect established parking places along the curbs of the streets in said zones, which said parking spaces were marked off and defined, and which said ordinances limited the time during which a vehicle could remain parked in said parking spaces, and provided a penalty for any person leaving a vehicle parked in said parking spaces in excess of the time allowed. These defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  further show unto the Court that the complainant by enacting said ordinance is attempting to convert the said streets and avenues within the parking meter zones designated by said ordinance into parking lots, and to charge the people a fee or toll for the use of said streets. These defendants further show unto the Court that the said parking meters constitute obstructions or nuisances on said streets and will interfere with the free flow of pedestrian traffic alongside and to and from the property owned and leased by the defendants, and that said parking meters constitute a public nuisance.&quot; [Italics supplied.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15. The defendants take the position, and contend and show unto the Court, that the said ordinance exhibited with the bill of complaint is invalid and void for the following reasons, separately and severally, that is to say:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) Said ordinance and the proposed operation and enforcement thereof deprives the defendants of their property without due process by law, and violates Section 6 of the Constitution of Alabama and Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) Said ordinance and the proposed operation and enforcement thereof denies the defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the equal protection of the laws and violates Section 1 of the Constitution of Alabama and Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) Said ordinance and the proposed enforcement thereof constitutes a taking of the property of the defendants by the City of Decatur for public use without the payment of just compensation therefor, and violates Section 235 of the Constitution of Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) Said ordinance was enacted not only for the purpose of regulating traffic, but for the purpose of raising revenue for the City of Decatur, and is an unlawful, arbitrary, unreasonable and unauthorized exercise of the taxing powers of the complainant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(5) Said ordinance as to the property of the said Eyster is in conflict with and a violation of the dedication of Moulton Street and Second Avenue as public streets in the City of Decatur by the said Decatur Land Improvement and Furnace Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;16. The defendants join in the request of the complainant that the Court render a declaratory judgment and decree as to the validity of said ordinance, and pray that the Court will declare the same to be null and void.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the case was at issue the parties entered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into a stipulation of fact from which we take the following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are 348 parking meter spaces painted on the streets in the parking meter zones. In painting the parking meter spaces upon the streets, as directed by Section 3 of the ordinance in question, the Chief of Police has left open spaces at each fire hydrant in the parking meter zones, and at each loading zone in front of business establishments in the parking meter zones as the same existed prior to the enactment of said ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No figures are available to show whether the average parking time after the installation of parking meters in Decatur will be reduced or increased, but three separate surveys made in other towns having parking meters have shown that the average parking time of each vehicle upon the installation of parking meters was reduced from 52.8 minutes to 32.7 minutes, from 23.6 to 19.9 minutes and from 46 to 40 minutes, respectively. Likewise, no figures are available as to what, if any effect the installation of parking meters in Decatur will have upon the increase or decrease of available parking space. Surveys made in two other towns have shown that after meters were installed, four cars found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  parking space where three had prior to meters, and in another city a turn-over was recorded of 6.8 cars per parking space per day prior to parking meters as compared with 8.3 cars per space per day following installation of meters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 10 of the ordinance restricts the use of funds which are deposited in said parking meters and attention of the court is invited to said section. Should there be any excess receipts over and above the amount required to carry out the provisions of said Section 10 of the ordinance, then complainant proposes that such should be used in acquisition of free parking lots, widening of streets, maintenance and erection of proper traffic markers and signs, pavement of alleys and improvement of approach in the rear of the congested business area and the opening of alleys similarly situated but presently unused. Such alleys are in existence behind and back of each of the blocks involved in the parking meter zones and extend either partially or completely through the entire block and only three of such alleys are improved or paved. * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a subsequent day the parties entered into the further stipulations, that: &quot;It is estimated that each parking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meter in Parking Meter Zone 'A' will gross $ 5.67 per month and that each meter in Parking Meter Zone 'B' will gross $ 2.84 per month. It is further estimated that the life of each parking meter will vary from ten to fifteen years.&quot; It is agreed that these stipulations of fact may be supplemented at the hearing by other testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is without dispute that steel posts or standards for the several meters are installed--set in concrete--in the sidewalk approximately 20 feet apart and from 4 to 5 feet in height, two feet from the street curb, allowing loading space and space for bus stops in the zones set apart by the ordinance for meters. The meters are also of steel, standing 17 inches in height, 8 inches in width and 6 inches in thickness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony was given ore tenus with exception of the depositions of witnesses Swann, Griffin, Roach and Gains, City Officials of Columbia, Tennessee. This testimony goes to show that there are only a small number, from 6 to 7, manufacturers of such equipment in the United States. That the manufacturers do not install such equipment but the right to install and set up said equipment is &quot;farmed out&quot; to sales agencies for different groups&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of states and that such sales agencies are interested in establishing the right to install such equipment through legislation or judicial decision in the territories of the states covered by such agencies, forming an interlocking high pressure salesmanship group which aids and gives comfort and support to any group where the right to install such equipment has not been established or is disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness Roswell Smith testified for complainant that he had been associated with parking meter companies since 1938 and that he and his brother were the district representatives of the &quot;Car-Park Meter Company&quot; with jurisdiction over North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. That they appoint state managers in the several states and that other sales groups do likewise. That he was interested in meters located in Florida, Georgia and Mississippi. That they have none in Alabama. That they are interested in this suit to establish the legality of such parking meters under contracts similar to the one here involved. That such groups &quot;have direct supervision over our representatives and all of the installations. We are not only interested in getting installations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but we are interested in the progress made, the effect of the installation on the cities, the profits derived from them so far as we are able to judge and the revenue collected and the allocation of the revenues. We are generally interested in the development of the meter business. * * * We are very much interested in what the meters are doing and how they are functioning, not only ours but those of our competitors. * * *.&quot; The testimony goes to show that the effect of establishing and using parking meters necessitates the employment of persons of mechanical skill to keep the meters in order and increases the expense of police supervision of meters; the purchase of a machine at a cost of $ 250 to separate or aid in the counting of the revenues and other expenses. The witness testified as to the cost of the meters and their installation and the duration of their use. That the patrol of the streets where meters are established is a continuous performance. He further testified that usually where the company gets 50% of the gross revenue the other 50% that the city gets is usually used for maintenance and costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking as an expert on his redirect examination this witness testified: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Q. You mean that in 18 to 30 months the city would not be able to take their costs off? A. Yes, sir. I think you will find that in your contract, unless it is different than most, the company's take is 50% of the gross revenue * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On being asked how he got in touch with the City of Decatur and who requested him to come in this case he stated: &quot;I came voluntarily to see Mr. Shanks. I didn't know him at the time, * * * whoever was representing the city, because we are interested in the final conclusion of this suit. * * * Yes, sir and in every state where there is any question we always come in and see what we can do. Some-times it is done by legislative enactment and sometimes by decisions of courts. * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness Speake, a member of the City Council of Decatur, testified that the question of signing the contract was &quot;very considerably&quot; discussed and especially at the meeting where Mr. Neterville, the representative of the meter company, was present and the use to which the revenue would be put, stating: &quot;Well, as I recall, it would just go into the general fund, funds are short at the time. It wasn't going to be earmarked funds after we paid for them. * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  witness Swann, whose deposition was taken by the official court reporter acting as commissioner by agreement of the parties, testified that he was superintendent of the streets and acting manager of the City of Columbia, Tenn., where meters had been installed and stated: &quot;The deposit of one penny in a meter will purchase 12 minutes parking time and the deposit of a nickel will produce 60 minutes parking time. * * *&quot; This witness further testified in respect to the city of which he is the manager that: &quot;It didn't increase the police force but that they had to put on more men. * * * It (the installation of meters) gave us a place for them. * * * If it hadn't been for the advent of parking meters, you would have to lay off some of them? A. Yes sir. * * *&quot; [Italics and parathensis supplied.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness Gaines testified that he was a fire truck driver and had been looking after the meters at Columbia, Tenn. That he had been looking after the meters since they were put in. That he was appointed driver on April 10, 1931, and since meters were installed, he was the driver of the fire truck and collected the coins from the meters. He was the man who maintained the meters in proper condition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***35]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On submission for final decree on pleadings and proof the circuit court entered a declaratory decree holding, among other things: &quot;Upon consideration of the pleadings and proof the Court is of the opinion, and it is so ordered, that there exists a justiciable controversy between the Complainant and the Respondents within the meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act, and that the parties have the right to have their rights declared in this cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one questions the general police power of the Complainant to regulate traffic in a reasonable manner on its streets. This power is so ancient that no authority need be cited in its support. There are, however, certain limitations upon this power, and in this case the Court is called upon to determine just how far the powers of a municipality extends, and where the rights of individual citizens begin. Rights and powers of both the individual citizen and the government must be mutually respected, and if either is permitted to invade the rights or authority of the other we do not have that type of government which is guaranteed by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court is of the opinion that the questions here presented were settled by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  our Supreme Court in January, 1937, in the case of City of Birmingham et al. v. Hood-McPherson Realty Co., 233 Ala. 352, 172 So. 114, 108 A.L.R. 1140. This case was a bill to abate a nuisance which the complainant alleged was created by the erection of parking meters on the streets of Birmingham adjacent to the complainant's property. In holding that the erection of parking meters on the streets of Birmingham created a nuisance the Supreme Court said that the municipality holds the streets in trust not only for the municipality and its citizens, but in trust for the public at large. It was said that the owner of property on a public street has the right to have his family, guests, or customers come and go within reasonable limitations and without the exaction of a fee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decree of the circuit courts holds, in part, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Birmingham case, as in this case, there was a dedication of the street to public use by a private corporation with a provision that the street could not be used for any other purpose except with the consent of the corporation. In this case there was the same kind of dedication of the streets involved in 'New Town'. The Supreme&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court held in the Birmingham case that the erection of parking meters on this street without the consent of the corporation which dedicated it was an unauthorized abandonment of the terms of the dedication deed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Supreme Court in the same case held that the use of parking meters in the manner proposed at that time was an unauthorized exercise of the taxing power of the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Court is of the opinion that the pleadings and proof in the case under consideration bring its under the same rules as laid down in the Birmingham case, and, therefore, that the ordinance authorizing parking meters in the City of Decatur is unconstitutional and void, and the Court hereby finds and declares the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the City of Decatur does not have the right or authority to erect parking meters and establish parking meter zones in the City of Decatur as outlined in the bill of complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That the adoption and passage of the ordinance authorizing the use of parking meters in the City of Decatur, and its effect deprives the Respondents of their property without due process of law in violation of both the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The adoption and passage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and effect of the ordinance authorizing the use of parking meters in the City of Decatur is an unlawful and unauthorized exercise of the taxing power of the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The adoption and passage and effect of the ordinance authorizing the use of parking meters in the City of Decatur as proposed is, as to the Respondents, Eyster and Frederick, in conflict with, and in violation of the dedication of Moulton Street and Second Avenue as public streets of the City of Decatur by the Decatur Land Improvement &amp; Furnace Company. * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complainant has appealed from this decree and frankly states that the purpose of the appeal is to induce this court to overrule the case of City of Birmingham et al. v. Hood-McPherson Realty Co., 233 Ala. 352, 172 So. 114, 108 A.L.R. 1140. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor of Alabama propounded questions under the 13 Ala. Code &sect; 34 (1940), as to whether an amendatory Act of the Legislature, requiring presidential electors to cast their ballots for the nominee of the national convention of the party by which they were elected, was violative of constitutional provisions. The Justices of the Supreme Court filed its answer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor sought an answer to the question: Did the amendment to &sect; 226 violate any provision of Article II of the Constitution of the United States or Article XII of the Amendments of the Constitution of the United States? The Justices stated that the language of the Constitution clearly showed that it was the intention of the framers that the electors chosen for the several states would exercise their discretion in the performance of their duty in the election of the president and vice-president, and in determining the individuals for whom they would cast the electoral votes of the states. The Justices held that history supported the interpretation without controversy. The Justices also held that when the legislature attempted to go further than its power of appointment of electors, and dictate to the electors the choice which they must make for president and vice-president, it invaded the field set apart to the electors by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The policeman filed an action against defendant city for back pay and alleged that the suspension was illegal. The trial court found in favor of the policeman. On review, the court found that the policeman was not serving under contract, but under law. Furthermore, the policeman had a common law action of debt because his suspension was invalid. The court reasoned that Ala. Code Tit. 62, &sect; 392 et seq. (1940) provided that a policeman could only be suspended for 30 days without a hearing. The policeman did not receive a hearing and his suspension was in excess of 30 days. Therefore, the trial court's decision was affirmed though modified to reflect the accurate amount of wages that remained unpaid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original plaintiff was the son of the mortgagor of property. Prior to the mortgagor's death, the mortgagor allegedly entered into a timber contract with the mortgagee that extended the time for payment of the mortgage by five years. When the mortgagor died before the passage of five years, the mortgagee held a foreclosure sale. The son brought a bill in equity to set aside the foreclosure sale or to exercise the right of redemption. The circuit court overruled the mortgagee's demurrer. The court rejected the circuit court's ruling that a bill in equity could be brought to exercise the right of redemption. The court held that the right of redemption abated at the death of the mortgagor and subsequent legislation could not revive the right that had already abated at the time of the legislation's enactment. Thus, the demurrer should have be sustained as to the exercise of the right of redemption. The court upheld that portion of the ruling relating to the request to set aside the foreclosure sale. The alleged timber contract did not violate the statute of frauds because it was capable of being performed within one year even though it was for a term of five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the circuit court's judgment as to the request to set aside the mortgage foreclosure, but reversed that part of the judgment relating to the exercise of the right of redemption. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The statute did not require the making of an impression from the patient's mouth. The making of a mold from a pre-existing appliance was sufficient to constitute practicing dentistry without a license. The court held that the statute against practicing dentistry without a license was a valid exercise of the State's police power. The statute did not constitute an unconstitutional restraint on trade by requiring a license to practice dentistry.

The court found no evidence supporting this contention. Next, defendant argued that the State's failure to transcribe the grand jury proceedings denied his right to due process, his right to a fair trial, and his right to confront the witnesses against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(1) (1975) of capital murder because it was committed during a first-degree kidnapping. On appeal, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in granting appellee state's challenge for cause as to a prospective juror. The record showed that although the man indicated that he could vote guilty and impose the death penalty in a circumstantial evidence case, his answers to other questions suggested that he would be unable to find defendant guilty and to recommend the death penalty. In light of the man's vacillating answers, and in deference to the trial judge, who in addition to hearing the words spoken by the prospective juror had the opportunity to observe his demeanor and appearance, his manner of speech and tone of voice, and his body language during his responses, the court did not find that the trial court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting appellee state's challenge for cause as to a prospective juror whose answers were at times contradictory because the trial judge was in the best position to determine which of the juror's answers were said with the greatest certainty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder in the execution-style killing of four men and sentenced to death by electrocution. Appellant challenged the judgment of the trial court. The judgment was affirmed. The evidence amply supported that although appellant intentionally killed only one person, he was responsible as an accomplice for the murder of the other three decedents. The testimony of the survivors of appellant's rampage testified as to the torture the decedents suffered before their deaths, which was relevant in determining whether the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstances applied regarding the gravity of the sentence. It was determined that the degree of heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty that characterized this offense exceeded that which is common to all capital offenses. Therefore, the sentence of death was neither disproportionate nor excessive. Searching the entire record for any error that may have adversely affected appellant's substantial rights, no error was found.</SPAN></P>

The court discussed 41 separate issues. The court denied appellant's procedural claims and claims of improper admission of evidence because these issues were within the provenance of trial court which did not abuse its discretion in its rulings. The court discussed appellant's arrest and self-incriminating statement, and determined both had been obtained in compliance with constitutional mandates and were proper and admissible. The court determined that the venire was properly screened for bias and that peremptory strikes were not discriminatory. Finally, the court denied U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant felon, on parole for a second time, murdered two females, was convicted and sentenced to death. Defendant filed a petition pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 for postconviction relief challenging his convictions and the death sentence.

Defendant also contended that his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at both the guilt and penalty phase of the trial was violated. Judgment was affirmed. The court concluded that defendant failed to provide evidence that he was prejudiced by one juror's involvement in a robbery 20 years previously, especially since the jury unanimously recommended that the death penalty be imposed.

Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975), alleging it was improper to deny his motion to suppress certain custodial statements and to deny his motion for a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for capital murder in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975) and remanded the case for new findings on defendant's aggravating and mitigating circumstances and a reevaluation of the sentence. The court found that defendant's two custodial statements were voluntary and were properly admitted at trial after looking at the totality of circumstances. The statements were made after defendant was advised of his juvenile-Miranda rights, no favorable treatment was promised, and no coercion or inducement occurred. The court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the evidence supported a finding that defendant intended to kill the victim and the evidence showed defendant was the triggerman. The court noted that the jury was properly instructed on complicity and the intent necessary for a capital conviction. The case was remanded because when the trial court overrode the jury's sentencing recommendation and imposed the death sentence, it had improperly considered defendant's youthful offender adjudications as convictions negating a mitigating circumstance of no history of prior criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder during the course of committing robbery, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2). Appellant brought 30 claims challenging his conviction. The court affirmed appellant's conviction because appellant failed to present any evidence as to why his conviction was erroneous. Among other things, appellant argued the trial court failed to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses. However, the court found no plain error where appellant's proposed instructions would have been incompatible with appellant's defenses in the case. In addition, appellant argued that the trial court improperly excluded a venireperson from serving on the jury. The appeals court held that appellant suffered no prejudice because of the removal of the juror and that she could have properly been struck for cause. Appellant argued he was denied due process and a fair trial due to the trial court's failure to order a change of venue. The court disagreed, holding that that appellant failed to show actual prejudice, or that the community was so saturated with pretrial publicity as to deny him a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of three counts of capital murder in connection with murder of a witness who had testified against him before a grand jury that had indicted appellant for theft. The murder was made capital (1) because it was committed during a burglary in the first degree; (2) because the victim, at the time of his murder, had testified before a grand jury that had indicted appellant for theft in the first degree; and (3) because the victim, at the time of his murder, had been subpoenaed to testify at appellant's trial on theft charge. The appellate court affirmed appellant's death sentence. The court rejected as meritless most of appellant's contentions that many pretrial rulings were erroneous. The court discussed appellant's objections to jury venire, the voir dire procedures, claims of juror bias, and trial court's refusal to grant a change of venue, and concluded that such objections were meritless. The court reviewed appellant's claims of double jeopardy, improper jury instructions, the presence of victim's family in courtroom, and the admission of certain evidence for plain error, because appellant failed to raise objections during trial, thus inviting error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming appellant's death sentence, the court held that the pretrial publicity in the case did not so pervasively saturate the community as to render court proceedings nothing more than a hollow formality. Furthermore, the court rejected appellant's contention that his convictions for both burglary and capital murder based upon the same act violated double jeopardy; however, appellant was only convicted of capital murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of capital murder and sentenced him to die. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not violate appellant's rights against unlawful search and seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV by refusing to suppress DNA within a blood sample taken while appellant was incarcerated. The state's interest in identifying criminals outweighed appellant's interest in the seizure of his blood, and although the blood was not drawn in accordance with promulgated regulations, the regulations did not supply appellant with substantive rights.  Ala. Code &sect; 36-18-25 did not create a right to refuse the blood sample. The trial court did not err by admitting the DNA evidence as the prosecution presented proof of the reliability and relevance of the population frequency statistical evidence under Ala. Code &sect; 36-18-30. The trial court properly denied appellant's motion for a mistrial where the prosecutor said, referring to appellant, &quot;let him testify,&quot; and the judge instructed the jury to disregard the remark. The court upheld the death sentence because no error injuring appellant's rights was apparent, and the sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence; the trial court properly allowed the prosecution to introduce DNA evidence because appellant could not show that the taking of the blood sample violated appellant's right to protection from unlawful search and seizure, or that he had a right to refuse the sample, and because the prosecution established the reliability and relevance of the statistical evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of creating a public nuisance by having weeds over 12 inches in her yard, a violation of a municipal code, Montgomery, Ala., Ordinance No. 37-91, Article VII, &sect; 1. The municipal court fined appellee and ordered her to pay court costs. She appealed her conviction and moved to dismiss the charges against her, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was vague, overbroad and violated her due process, equal protection, free speech, and property rights. The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss, and the city appealed. The court reversed, finding that the term &quot;weed&quot; contained in the ordinance was not vague or overbroad. Additionally, the court found that no taking of appellee's property occurred, and even if it did, the city was not required to compensate appellee. The ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the city's police power, and the city required appellee to cut the plants because they constituted a nuisance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for capital murder and of his death sentence, both entered in the Shelby Circuit Court (Alabama), challenging the validity of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 15-12-21, -22. Appellant also challenged the denial of his motion for a change of venue, the trial court's use of Witherspoon questions, the admission of photographs of the victims and a videotape of the crime scene, and the effectiveness of defense counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant and three codefendants planned to kill one man. To conceal this murder, they also killed three additional victims who were present at the scene. Appellant was convicted of capital murder because the jury found that he committed the killings by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10) (1975). He was sentenced to death by electrocution. The reviewing court affirmed his conviction and sentence. It first rejected his claim that Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 15-12-21, -22 (1975) was invalid, finding that the Alabama Supreme Court had approved the compensation scheme for attorneys representing indigent defendants. The court also upheld the denial of appellant's motion for a change of venue, finding that he failed to show either actual or presumptive prejudice toward him. Additionally, the court rejected appellant's claims that the trial court erred in propounding Witherspoon questions to potential jurors, and in admitting photographs of the victims and a videotape of the crime scene. His ineffective assistance of counsel claim was likewise rejected because the decisions his counsel made were trial strategy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and death sentence, holding that no reversible error was committed in the denial of his motion for change of venue where he failed to show actual or presumptive prejudice. The court also rejected appellant's claims regarding his attorney's assistance and statutory limits on compensation, the admission of certain evidence, and the propounding of Witherspoon questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an appeal from a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted appellant of murder made captial because it occurred during the commission of a robbery in the first degree, convicted appellant of first-degree theft, sentenced appellant to death by electrocution for the capital offense, and sentenced appellant, as a habitual offender with three prior felony convictions, to life imprisonment for the theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, packing a pistol and driving a car stolen by appellant's fellow gang member upon appellant's request, was accompanied by his armed gang when he decided to rob victim because victim had a good stereo system in his car. Appellant followed victim's car, pulled the stolen car in front of victim's car, and shot victim. Appellant was convicted of capital murder during the commission of a robbery in the first degree. Although the jury, by a 12-0 vote, recommended life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the trial court overrode the jury's recommendation and sentenced appellant to death by electrocution. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found, among other things, that the trial court properly granted a motion in limine that prevented appellant from presenting evidence that victim was a drug dealer. A detective's misrepresentation about finding fingerprints did not make appellant's confession involuntary. Taken as a whole, the trial court's jury instruction properly conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury, and it did not lessen the state's burden of proof. The jury override provision of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(e) (1975) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted appellant of capital murder and theft and sentenced appellant to death by electrocution and life imprisonment because the trial court's jury instruction properly conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury and the jury's recommended sentence was permissibly overridden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, juvenile sex offenders, sought to stay enforcement of 1998 Ala. Acts 98-489, an amendment to the Community Notification Act, Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 (the Act). Appellees contended that the Act violated their right to equal protection of the law because the Act permitted a convicted adult sex offender to return to a home where a minor child resides, but did not afford them the same right as juveniles. While the trial court found that the Act did not deny appellees equal protection of the law, it did find that it violated the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution because it created a penalty not prescribed when appellees were adjudicated. Appellant state challenged those portions of the trial court opinion that found the Act unconstitutional, and appellees challenged those portions that found the Act did not violate equal protection. On appeal, the court found that on its face, the Act violated the equal protection clause. The court held that even under the lowest tier of review, there was no rational basis for treating adult sex offenders differently than juvenile sex offenders. The court also found that the amendment violated the ex post facto clause.</SPAN></P>

Finally, appellant argued that the trial court erred when it granted the state's motion in limine to prevent the defense from raising allegations that the deceased was HIV positive. The court affirmed the convictions and found that the trial court did not err when it failed to grant a witness immunity or to admit her grand jury testimony because appellant failed to make an offer of proof that the witness's testimony was relevant to the subject matter of the prosecution. The trial court's definition of reasonable doubt was proper because when the instruction was read as a whole, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the instruction.

Defendant's sentence was suspended &quot;on general good behavior&quot; for two years. Defendant did not receive actual jail time in sentencing. Defendant appealed and argued that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to inquire sua sponte into his indigency status and to appoint a lawyer to represent him before allowing him to enter a guilty plea. The court affirmed. The court held that there was no right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI for defendant to affirmatively waive because defendant's sentence did not include actual imprisonment and because there were no conditions that resulted in defendant's imprisonment before he was placed on probation. Because the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not exist, the trial court did not err by failing to conduct a sua sponte inquiry to determine whether defendant was indigent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the charge given by the trial judge to the jury was not improper as it did not suggest which way the verdict should be rendered nor was it in any way coercive or threatening. The court concluded that the trial judge did not have any idea as to which way the jury was leaning when the charge was given, so it could not have attempted to influence a verdict in either direction. The court also found that the evidence supported the conviction of appellant, even though much of it was circumstantial and two of the witnesses consisted of a convicted felon and an informant. The court determined that it was for the jury to determine the weight and sufficiency to be given to the witnesses and any motive they may have had for testifying. The court concluded that the circumstantial evidence was entitled to the same weight as direct evidence, provided it pointed to the guilt of appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder committed during a robbery, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40 (a)(2) (1975), and sentenced to death. Defendant raised several arguments on appeal, including that the joinder of his trial with his codefendant over his objection violated his constitutional rights, that the method of selecting the grand jury foreperson was racially discriminatory, and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct that deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial, due process, and a reliable sentence. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motions to sever because he did not meet his burden by showing specific prejudice that warranted a severance. Further, the court held that no prima facie case of discrimination was established. Also, the court found that the prosecutorial comments complained of, regardless of their origin, were accurate descriptions of the crime and supported by facts in the record, and that the comments were not improper under the circumstances. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant and sentencing him to death after finding no evidence that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder committed during a robbery, murder committed during a burglary, murder committed during a rape, and the murder of two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, all capital offenses.

On appeal, in accordance with Ala.R.App.P. 45A, the court examined the record for any plain error. The court found no plain error or defect in either in the guilt phase or in the sentencing phase of the trial. The sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The court concluded that the findings and conclusions of the trial court were amply supported by the evidence. After independently weighing the aggravating circumstances against the statutory and non-statutory mitigating circumstances, the court concurred in the trial court's judgment that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and the sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court, Blount County (Alabama), which denied his petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 that challenged his conviction for capital murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder. Defendant brought a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32. Defendant's Rule 32 petition was denied, and he appealed. He argued that the trial court erred in adopting the state's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in its order denying his petition, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court ruled that the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by the evidence and were not clearly erroneous. Further, the court held that defendant had the burden of showing that his counsel's assistance was ineffective, and that even if his counsel's performance was determined to be deficient, defendant was not entitled to relief unless he established that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. The court affirmed the conviction and concluded that there was a strong presumption that counsel's conduct was appropriate and reasonable and that defendant failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying defendant's petition for postconviction relief was affirmed where the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by the evidence and were not clearly erroneous, and defendant failed to prove that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because defendant presented no evidence to show how he was prejudiced by the allegations of ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him and sentenced him to death for three murders that arose pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct in violation of Ala.

Appellant argued that court improperly found, as an aggravating circumstance, that the capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murdering three individuals by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10) (1975). The trial court sentenced appellant to death after it found, as an aggravating circumstance, that the capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses. Appellant's sentence was vacated and remanded on appeal because the court found that the prosecution had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-45(e), the aggravating circumstance that the capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses. Specifically, the court found that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the prosecution's burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicides were conscienceless or pitiless homicides that were unnecessarily torturous to the victims. Therefore, the sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing before the trial court without consideration of the aggravating circumstance that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel compared to other capital offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's imposition of the death sentence upon appellant was vacated and remanded because the evidence was found to have been insufficient to support the trial court's aggravating circumstance finding that the murders for which appellant had been convicted of had been especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant did not specifically challenge sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions; therefore, the court did not reiterate the evidence presented. However, the court did review the evidence and found it sufficient to support defendant's first-degree murder convictions and death penalty sentence. The court also noted that appellant failed to make appropriate objections during his trial to most of the thirty some points of error; therefore, the court reviewed those points of error for plain error pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 45A. For instance, appellant's pre-trial discovery requests did not specifically request the 12 items listed in Perry; therefore, appellant failed to show that the trial court improperly deny his pre-trial discovery request. The court found that trial court did not err in not giving an intoxication instruction, as there was no evidence in the record that appellant was intoxicated nor did appellant request such instruction. The search conducted by the police of appellant's hotel room was proper, as registered guest consented to search. The court concluded that appellant received a fair trial and affirmed appellant's convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, appellant did not show that community was so saturated with prejudicial publicity that he could not receive a fair trial or that any of pretrial publicity actually biased any of the prospective jurors against him, as the jurors were not required to be totally ignorant of facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Morgan Circuit Court (Alabama) that convicted and sentenced him for the capital offense of murder committed during a robbery, asserting his trial should have been severed from his co-defendant's, the trial court erred in allowing a police officer to identify appellant from a surveillance tape, and the prosecution improperly used the robbery as an element of the crime and as an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction and sentence for the capital offense of murder committed during a robbery, asserting the joinder of his trial with his co-defendant's violated his rights, the police officer's identification testimony should have been excluded, and the prosecution improperly used the robbery as an element of capital murder and as an aggravating circumstance. The court held joinder of the trials was proper where appellant and his co-defendant were alleged to have participated in the same transaction, and their defenses were not antagonistic to the point of being mutually exclusive. The court held the admission of the police officer's identification testimony was not improper where the identification was cumulative of three other witnesses' identifications, which were clearly admissible because they were better qualified than the jury to correctly identify appellant. The court held the robbery could be considered as an aggravating circumstance where it was listed in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49, and the use of an element of capital murder in that way did not punish appellant twice. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence of death were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised several errors on appeal that were not raised during the trial; however, pursuant to Ala. R. App. P. 45A, his failure to object at trial did not bar appellate review because appellant was sentenced to death. The court discussed all of appellant's alleged errors and found them to be without merit, thus his conviction and sentence were affirmed. While most of the evidence linking appellant to the robbery and murders was circumstantial, that did not render the state's evidence insufficient. In order to obtain a change of venue, appellant was required to show that pre-trial publicity surrounding the case was inherently prejudicial. The court reviewed all of the evidence presented by appellant in support of his motion for change of venue and concluded that most of the reports of the murders and robbery were reasonably factual and objective and were not inflammatory or prejudicial in tone. Thus, the change of venue motion was properly denied. Furthermore, after carefully reviewing the record of the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial, the court found no evidence that the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed each and every allegation of error as well as the cumulative effect of such alleged errors and found that the alleged errors were without merit. Furthermore, because no single instance of alleged error constituted reversible error, the court did not consider the cumulative effect to be any greater. Thus, appellant's convictions and death sentence on three counts of capital murder were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the court held that defendant's counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that counsel adequately investigated and presented mitigating evidence and that there was no basis for defendant's claim that counsel did not discover and present exculpatory evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner son and petitioner mother asserted that the Community Notification Act (act), Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20(e), violated petitioners' constitutional rights and denied petitioner son equal protection under the law. Under &sect; 15-20-20(e), petitioner son, as a 12 year old criminal sexual offender adjudicated for sodomy, could not live or work within 1000 feet of a public or private school or child care center. Plus, notification of his presence to people living within three miles of petitioners' residence was required. The judge made written findings and asked to stay the enforcement against petitioner son. The judge found the act to be unconstitutional as it applied to juveniles. The act violated the ex post facto clause of the federal constitution in that a 1998 amendment to the act created a penalty that was not proscribed when petitioner son was adjudicated a delinquent. The judge further found the provisions of the act relating to residency and notification requirement were unconstitutionally vague. The act interfered with the rights of parents and children to intimate association under the U.S. Const. amends. I, IX, and XIV. The petition was declared moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a mentally retarded 13-year-old adjudicated delinquent on an underlying offense of rape, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the court to order a trial judge for the Tenth Judicial Circuit (Alabama) to stay enforcement of the Community Notification Act, Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq. (1975) as that act applied to petitioner. Petitioner's motion for a stay had been denied by the Jefferson Juvenile Court (Alabama).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being adjudicated on an underlying offense of rape, petitioner was placed in the custody of the state youth services and ordered to participate in a sexual offender treatment program. After petitioner had successfully completed the terms of his sentence, he was released to the custody of his mother. After the trial court was notified that Ala. Code &sect; 15-20-20 et seq. (the Act) applied to juvenile offenders, petitioner was transported to the sheriff's department to undergo DNA testing. Petitioner argued that the Act violated his constitutional rights. On receipt of the petition, the court stayed enforcement of the Act temporarily and directed the trial judge to make findings of fact concerning the allegations. The trial judge found that Act to be unconstitutional as it applied to juveniles because it violated the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution and was unconstitutionally vague as to its residency and notification requirements. Therefore, the court found that petitioner had received the relief he requested in his petition for the writ of mandamus and there was no need for the court to stay enforcement of the Act because the petition had become moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed petitioner's petition for a writ of mandamus and held that the petition had become moot because the trial judge had found the statute at issue to be unconstitutional as applied to juveniles. Therefore petitioner was found to have received the relief requested.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the order of the trial court did not specify which claims its order of denial encompassed, nor did it make specific findings of fact with regard to each of those claims, the court must have remanded for the trial court to state the grounds, whether procedural or based on the merits, for its denial of the Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder made capital because it was committed during the course of a robbery in the first degree pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975). The jury recommended that appellant be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, but the trial court sentenced appellant to death. Appellant raised several issues in his appeal which he did not raise in the trial court. However, because appellant was sentenced to death, his failure to object at trial did not bar the court's review of these issues. The court held that it did weigh against appellant as to any claim of prejudice he made on appeal. The court held that there was no evidence that the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and that the findings and conclusions of the trial court were amply supported by the evidence. The court also concluded that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances and that death was the appropriate sentence. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence because although appellant's failure to raise the issues at trial did not preclude the court's review, the court did not find that any of the issues raised by appellant required a different result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the offense of murder made capital because it was committed during a robbery in the first degree under Ala.

Following a sentencing hearing before the trial court, appellant was sentenced to death. Appellant raised several issues on appeal that were not preserved at the trial. However, the court held that because the case involved the death penalty, the court would review appellant's assertions for plain error. The court held that appellant's assertions as to the impropriety of the manner of selecting the jury and alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not warrant reversal as there was no plain error since the foreperson was chosen from a properly constituted jury; there was no evidence that appellant's sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) convicted defendant of capital murder and attempted murder and sentenced him to death by electrocution. On appeal, the case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter a sentencing order in compliance with Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47(d) (1975). The trial court filed its return with the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon review, the appellate court held that defendant was correctly found guilty of capital murder and that the trial court erred in imposing the death sentence. The trial court's return stated that &quot;the act itself&quot; was an aggravating circumstance in the case. That finding was erroneous. The offense with which defendant was charged was not among the offenses specified in subsection Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-49(4) (1975). &quot;The act itself&quot; therefore could not have been an aggravating circumstance. Because defendant failed to raise the issue of his alleged lack of opportunity to challenge consolidation, the appellate court could not consider the argument on appeal. Because defendant's claims of improper consolidation could not be considered, his claim of cumulative errors associated with that consolidation also failed. Defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice from the trial court's refusal to allow him to individually voir dire members of the jury as to potential racial prejudice. Defendant was not prejudiced by his inability to further cross-examine and confront the attempted murder victim concerning his statement to the officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed and his sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, at first denying involvement, later claimed he accidentally shot his girlfriend twice, poured alcohol over her, laid her 22-month-old son near her, and set the home on fire. He claimed that &quot;voices&quot; told him to set the fire. Witnesses who knew him testified that he seemed normal at the time of the crime, and that they never thought he was mentally ill. The State's expert opined that he was sane; a defense expert opined that he was a schizophrenic. He was sentenced to death for the child's murder. The appellate court held that the evidence, including the testimony of the lay witnesses, was sufficient for the jury to conclude he was sane. The fact that defendant changed his story, and tried to cover up the crime, showed he knew his actions were wrong. He was not entitled to instructions on the lesser-included offenses of (1) reckless murder, as he had directed his actions toward these victims; or of (2) reckless manslaughter, as there was no evidence that the was intentionally committing a felony when he unintentionally killed the victims. In aggravation, the trial court properly considered his prior conviction, and that his murder of the child was especially cruel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles issued a decision to bar petitioner inmate from parole consideration. The inmate sought a writ of certiorari in which he challenged that decision. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) summarily denied the petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board denied the inmate's parol under Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-27.1 which barred parole for certain repeat violent offenders. The inmate argued that &sect; 15-22-27.1 was implicitly repealed by the Habitual Felony Offender Act (HFOA), Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9, which denied parole for a more limited class of repeat offenders. The appellate court disagreed because Ala. Code Ann. &sect; 15-22-27.1 and the HFOA did not conflict. Whereas &sect; 15-22-27.1 denied parole eligibility upon the commission of certain offenses, the HFOA required imprisonment for life without parole only upon a conviction of a Class A felony after three prior felony convictions. Therefore the ordinary sentence of &quot;life&quot; under the HFOA required parole consideration but the same conclusion did not apply to a sentence for a term of years. Statutes other than the HFOA could affect a defendant's punishment, so long as they did not alter the range set out in the HFOA. In the case, denial of the inmate's parole eligibility did not change the fact that his sentence was within a proper range under the HFOA. Therefore, both Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the prosecutor's complaint was void because it did not include the language &quot;to another person&quot; in describing the intent element of the offense. The appellate court held that the complaint substantially tracked the language of the statute. The complaint contained sufficient facts and a sufficient description of the elements to inform defendant of the charge so that he could prepare a defense and invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because the complaint contained all the essential elements of the charge, it was valid. Defendant was convicted of third-degree assault, a Class A misdemeanor, and was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, suspended, and probation, conditioned on the payment of fines, costs, and restitution. The constitutional right to counsel applied in misdemeanor cases where the sentence of imprisonment was suspended conditionally. Therefore, defendant had a constitutional right to counsel. Nothing in the record indicated that defendant knowingly, understandingly, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction, that the circuit court improperly refused to give his requested jury instructions on provocation, that his Batson challenge was improperly denied, and that his videotaped confession was wrongly admitted into evidence. The court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found defendant guilty of capital murder. The court held that the circuit court properly refused to give defendant's requested instructions because provocation was thoroughly covered in the oral charge to the jury. It was also held that defendant did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination and did not show that the denial of his Batson motion was clearly erroneous, and that there was no error in the admission of defendant's videotaped confession because there was evidence that the confession was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

The convictions and sentences were affirmed by the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prisoner was charged in a four-count indictment with intentional murder of an elderly woman during the course of a burglary, arson in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and sexual abuse in the first degree. He was found guilty on all counts and the jury unanimously recommended death as punishment. The convictions and sentences were affirmed by the court as well as the state supreme court. The U.S. Supreme Court denied prisoner's petition for certiorari review and the circuit court denied his petition filed under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32. Upon review, petitioner asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at both the trial and appellate level. Additionally, prisoner claimed that he was incompetent to stand trial. The court held that prisoner failed on his ineffectiveness claim by not establishing, under Strickland, both that his counsel's performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced as a result of the deficiency. Further, proof of the incompetency involved more than simply showing that the accused had mental problems or psychological difficulties. Thus, prisoner was found competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

All of defendant's claims of error were rejected and his conviction and sentence affirmed. The circumstantial evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the conviction for capital murder when it established his presence just before the killings, he had discussed obtaining weapons and easy money, the victims were killed execution-style, defendant had certain denominations of dollar bills that were similar to a victim's, and a co-defendant turned over another victim's jewelry to police. Thus denial of a motion of acquittal was also proper. It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a mistrial motion where there was contact between a member of the district attorney's office and a juror because they were friends, the juror declined to discuss the case, and the juror did not know what the member did for a living or where the district attorney's office violated an agreed upon discovery order.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his convictions and found that the circuit court did not err in denying his motion to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of his arrest, which he based on his contention that the officer who stopped his vehicle lacked the reasonable suspicion required to temporarily detain and question him. Under the circumstances, the stopping officer had a reasonably warranted suspicion that defendant was at the time that the officer stopped him, and previously may have been, engaged in criminal conduct. In addition, there was sufficient evidence to convict him on the driving while under the influence charge, and the circuit court did not err in denying his motion for an acquittal on that charge. The court remanded his case and directed the circuit court to resentence him on the charge of driving while his license was revoked because his one-year sentence on that charge exceeded the statutory limit for a conviction under &sect; 32-6-19.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that, under the facts of this case, defendant was not &quot;directly affected&quot; by any overbreadth of Ordinance no. 39-54. Defendant could not claim that he was &quot;directly affected&quot; by the overbreadth of the ordinance because, regardless of how the ordinance is construed, the officer at issue clearly had the authority to ask the appellant to answer questions about his headlights. Regardless of the overbreadth of Ordinance no. 39-54, defendant had the legal duty to follow the officer's orders; refusal to do so was illegal. Defendant failed to show that police officers would use the ordinance to encroach upon First Amendment protections and failed to show that Ordinance no. 39-54 was unconstitutional on its face. Defendant also failed to show how the ordinance itself violated any of his rights to equal protection. The ordinance's terms were facially neutral, applying equally regardless of race or any other classification.

Defendant sought post conviction relief pursuant to Ala. R. Crim. P. 32. Defendant filed a discovery motion requesting access to all of the files, from all of the state agency, with information regarding his case. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) granted the motion only as to district attorney's files. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was nothing in Ala. R. Crim. P. 32 or any other Rule of Criminal Procedure that allowed the &quot;unlimited&quot; discovery the defendant sought in his post-conviction proceeding. There was no postconviction right to &quot;fish&quot; through official files for belated grounds of attack on the judgment, or to confirm mere speculation or hope that a basis for collateral relief may exist. Defendant was attempting to retry his case. The court stated that discovery in a post-conviction proceeding was only allowed when &quot;good cause&quot; was shown. The trial court's discovery order granting defendant access to the district attorney's files gave defendant more than he was lawfully entitled to obtain in a post-conviction proceeding. Accordingly, since defendant established no &quot;clear legal right&quot; to the discovery he sought in his post-conviction proceeding, his petition for a writ of mandamus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached a 16-year-old girl at a library. After striking up a conversation with the girl, defendant said he was in the library to see how many orgasms a woman could have, and bragged that he once had a woman have 20 orgasms. The librarian called for the girl to come to her, after which defendant left the library. Later that day, defendant pulled his car beside the girl at a drive-in restaurant. Defendant left the restaurant after the girl complained to a waitress. The city charged defendant with harassment under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-8(a)(1)(b) (1975). The municipal court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, which the circuit court affirmed. The city argued that the statute should apply to obscene language as well as fighting words. However, the court held that it was unable to address the applicability of the harassment statute because none of the courts below held that the statute was unconstitutional. The court noted that the city did not have the right to appeal the municipal court's grant of defendant's motion to dismiss to the circuit court under Ala. R. Crim. P. 30.1(b) because the municipal court did not hold the harassment statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of violating the Alabama Code of Ethics for Public Officials (Ethics Act), Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 36-21-1 to -30, and of perjury in the first degree. Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him, a duplicitous indictment, and that the Ethics Act was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the state insurance commissioner, was convicted of violating the Ethics Act by knowingly and willfully associating with a business he regulated as insurance commissioner and by knowingly and willfully accepting something of value from a person associated with a business that he regulated. Defendant was also convicted of two counts of perjury in the first degree. On appeal, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him, a duplicitous indictment, and that the Ethics Act was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed that there was insufficient evidence and reversed the conviction. On the ethics charges, the court found that the state had failed to prove that defendant had an association with a &quot;business&quot; as defined in Ala. Code &sect; 36-25-1(2) (1975), and that he had the requisite criminal intent when he accepted a check from his daughter. On the perjury charges, the court held that the state failed to prove the falsity of defendant's testimony. Next, the court held that the state should have elected only one of the two charges on perjury. Lastly, the court held that the Ethics Act was constitutional and not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction because there was insufficient evidence to convict him of violating the Ethics Act and of perjury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four charges of the production of obscene matter containing a visual reproduction of a person under 17 years of age, a violation of Ala.

Code &sect; 13A-12-196 (1975); and three charges of enticing a child under the age of 16 to enter his residence for immoral purposes, a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-69 (1975). On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court found that the jury had sufficient evidence, if believed, on which to find defendant guilty of each of the charges under &sect;&sect; 13A-12-196, 13A-12-197 without the introduction of photographs. The court also noted that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-190(13) (1975) required only that the depictions of alleged sexual conduct lack &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot; to be &quot;obscene&quot; and did not have to meet the Miller standard, which applied to depictions of breast nudity. Therefore, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the obscenity standard.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of both counts and was sentenced to consecutive sentences of life imprisonment as a habitual offender for the first count and to five years' imprisonment on the second count. Defendant's post-conviction petition under Ala. R. Crim. P. 32, which collaterally attacked the legality of his convictions, was denied. The court affirmed, holding that defendant was appropriately sentenced under the Habitual Felony Offender Act, and that there was no error in the denial of defendant's post-conviction petition. The court found no merit in defendant's allegation that he was denied the right to appeal because there was uncontradicted testimony to the effect that defendant repeatedly told his trial counsel that he did not want to appeal. The court stated that there was also no merit to defendant's allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel because the record indicated that defendant, with the advice of his counsel, made a conscious and informed decision not to appeal his case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to operating his car radio at a level that was plainly audible at a distance of five feet, a violation of Montgomery, Ala., Municipal Code &sect; 27-6(a). The court affirmed the judgment and held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because the distance standards in ordinance defined what constituted a violation of the ordinance with sufficient detail to put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of what conduct was prohibited. The statute prohibited any sound coming from a device that was s plainly audible at the proscribed distance. The statute specifically provided that a violation occurred if the music was plainly audible to any person. If a law enforcement officer heard sounds from a musical device at the proscribed distance, then the ordinance was violated. Further, the ordinance was not overly broad, as the challenged portion of the ordinance covered only noise coming from radios, musical instruments, and similar devices, and not protected speech. The breadth of the ordinance was not unreasonable even though it did not limit its application to certain times or to certain areas.</SPAN></P>

Acts 96-454, which set up the county's system of calling prospective jurors from the county as a whole and not solely from the division of the county where the offense occurred, was declared unconstitutional by the Alabama Supreme Court (Supreme Court). Defendants were indicted on their offenses before the Act was declared unconstitutional. The trial court denied defendants' motions to dismiss the indictments. Thereafter, defendants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel such dismissal, which the court granted. The court held that the Supreme Court's decision would be applied retroactively to defendants because the Act was no more constitutional before it was successfully challenged than it was after the Supreme Court issued its opinion that declared it unconstitutional. The retroactive application of the Supreme Court's decision would not result in undue hardship on the county, and there was an overwhelming preference for the retroactive application of judicial decisions. The re-indictment of defendants by a constitutionally empaneled grand jury did not dismiss the first indictments, whose disposition the court held had to be reflected in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which was entered on the jury's verdict that convicted defendant of trafficking in marijuana, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-231 (1975), and of failing to affix a tax stamp, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 40-17A-4 (1975). Defendant was sentenced to prison, but given probation on a portion of his trafficking conviction sentence and on all of his tax stamp sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A package that contained marijuana was seized by police officers pursuant to a search warrant for defendant's apartment. Defendant was convicted of trafficking in marijuana and of failing to affix a tax stamp. In its substituted opinion, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. It also remanded the matter for the imposition of a fine pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-281 (1975). The court held that the search warrant was executed on nine months before the Alabama Supreme Court held that anticipatory search warrants were invalid. Thus, the officers did not have knowledge, nor could they be charged with knowledge, that the warrant was invalid because of its anticipatory nature. The officers acted in good faith when they searched defendant's residence, and defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from his apartment was properly denied. There was sufficient evidence to present the case to the jury on the issue of defendant's constructive possession of the marijuana. The officers testified that defendant told them, without opening the package, that it contained about four pounds of marijuana, and that he had mailed $ 2,100 to the seller for a prior shipment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, in its substituted opinion, affirmed the trial court's judgment, which convicted defendant of trafficking in marijuana and failing to affix a tax stamp. The court remanded the matter to the trial court for the imposition of a mandatory fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the sentencing order of the Marion Circuit Court (Alabama), which imposed the death penalty for defendant's murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a sentence-phase hearing, defendant called witnesses to prove that at the time of the killing he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance and that he had acted under the extreme duress of another person. The trial court overrode the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment without parole and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant first argued that the trial court failed to consider mitigating evidence of remorse and other nonstatutory mitigating evidence. The court held that the trial court allowed defendant to present mitigating evidence and duly considered it. Defendant also claimed that the trial court's imposition of the death sentence, after the jury returned with a life imprisonment recommendation, was unconstitutional. The court held that the Eighth Amendment did not define the weight that the sentencing judge must accord to an advisory jury verdict. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in considering his robbery conviction as an element of capital murder and as an aggravating circumstance. The court held that this practice, known as &quot;double counting,&quot; did not violate defendant's rights against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court searched and found no error adversely affecting the rights of defendant in the sentencing proceedings. However, the court remanded to the trial court for the entry into the record of specific findings as to the existence or nonexistence of any nonstatutory mitigating circumstances that were considered in imposing the death sentence on defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Marshall Circuit Court (Alabama), which found him guilty of murder, made capital because it was committed during a robbery, and sentenced him to death upon the jury's recommendation. Defendant argued that the trial court committed numerous errors in both the trial and sentencing phases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his arrest was illegal, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 15-10-1 (1975), because the arresting officer was not acting within his respective county when he arrested him. The court disagreed and held that, while &sect; 15-10-1 provided support for defendant's argument, the enactment of Ala. R. Crim. P. 3.3 removed the county limitation on the officer's arrest powers. Accordingly, defendant's arrest was proper because the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had committed a felony. Further, the court found that the trial court did not err when it refused to instruct the jury on any lesser-included offenses because there was no reasonable theory on which to base the offense of manslaughter; the jury could have only found defendant guilty or not guilty of the capital offense. The court also found that the trial court had properly removed three jurors for cause because they had indicated that they were unable to impose the death penalty. The court addressed defendant's remaining contentions and found that no plain error or defect had occurred in either the guilt or sentencing phases of defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, after pleading guilty to burglary in the third degree and being given a suspended sentence and probation, appealed from an order of the Covington Circuit Court (Alabama) revoking his probation on the grounds that he had committed two new offenses: the unlawful possession of a pistol after having been convicted of a crime of violence and menacing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the probation revocation hearing, the State presented evidence showing that defendant approached a group of boys, and after being informed that an associate of defendant's had just run away, threatened them with a gun. He told them that if they spoke to the associate again he would kill them or put them in the hospital. He also told the boys that he would kill the associate or put him in the hospital. The trial court stated that defendant's probation was revoked because of his possession of a gun after being convicted of a crime of violence. On appeal, the court held that the State failed to meet its burden of showing that the acts underlying defendant's third-degree burglary conviction would have constituted a burglary before the new Criminal Code so as to be included in the language defining a crime of violence. The court determined that since the enactment of the new Criminal Code, it was insufficient for the trial court to simply look at the name of an offense and rule that it was a crime of violence. The court concluded, therefore, that the trial court improperly revoked defendant's probation on the sole grounds that he possessed a gun after committing a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's revocation order and remanded the case for a new probation revocation hearing, with instructions that if the trial court should conclude that defendant violated his probation, it was to enter a written order containing its specific reasons for revoking defendant's probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for capital murder by a county grand jury.

Rather, the Act divided the county into two divisions for purposes of economy and convenience. Thus, the Act did not violate Ala. Const. art.

The murder was made capital because it occurred during a burglary, the victim was a grand jury witness, the victim had been subpoenaed to testify at the trial of co-defendant, and the victim was a police officer. Defendant was found guilty because the murder was committed during a burglary, the victim was a grand jury witness, and the victim was going to testify at the trial against co-defendant. The jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court overrode the jury's recommendation and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of intentional murder. The court opined that that the trial court properly considered the two convictions in sentencing defendant to death by electrocution. The court found that the facts of the case did not preclude a conviction for the capital offense of murder committed during a burglary. The court denied the remainder of defendant's contentions on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the St. Clair Circuit Court (Alabama) for felony offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI), after having been convicted of three prior DUI. violations within the past five years. The trial court sentenced defendant to four years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by failing to give limiting instructions to the jury regarding its consideration of his three prior DUI convictions. On appeal, the court noted that defense counsel did not object, nor did he request any limiting instructions concerning the jury's consideration of defendant's prior DUI convictions. Thus, defendant's assertion that the trial court erred by failing to give special limiting instructions to the jury regarding its consideration of the three prior DUI convictions was not preserved for review. Further, the felony DUI statute and the punishment provided for in Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191 were constitutional. However, the trial court sentenced defendant to four years' imprisonment, but failed to impose the statutorily mandated fine. Thus, the case had to be remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded with directions that the trial court hold a hearing to allow the State, defendant, and his counsel the opportunity to address what would be an appropriate fine, and for the trial court to impose a fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murder. He appealed, arguing that one of the trial court's jury instructions created a mandatory rebuttable presumption that impermissibly relieved the State of its burden of proving every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court agreed and found that the instruction created a mandatory presumption because a reasonable juror could have understood it to require a finding that defendant had the specific criminal intent to commit murder if the prosecution proved that he was carrying a pistol without a license. Reviewing the instruction on its face, the court found that proof of a defendant's possession of a pistol without a license was clearly insufficient to support the presumption that the defendant had the criminal intent to commit murder where self-defense has been injected as a defense. The State contended that the instruction was harmless because the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming. The court concluded that the State did not present overwhelming evidence of guilt to the extent that the trial court's improper instruction could have been considered harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-90 (1975) of stalking his ex-wife and placed him on five years probation. Over defendant's objections, the trial court had admitted photos that showed the injuries defendant had inflicted on his ex-wife in an assault six and a half years earlier as well as evidence of a prior harassment charge of which defendant had been acquitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not object to his ex-wife's testimony at trial regarding the earlier assault. The trial court denied defendant's motions for acquittal and for a new trial. On appeal, the court held that the state had made out a prima facie case of stalking. The court noted that the evidence showed defendant had repeatedly followed and harassed his ex-wife and threatened her in stores and at her workplace. It also showed that he had shouted insults at her, printed a flyer about her and distributed it around the town, and threatened, with both words and gestures, to shoot her and her boyfriend. The court found that the ex-wife knew defendant owned a shotgun and that she had been placed in reasonable fear of death or bodily harm. The court held that it was not necessary to prove defendant actually intended to kill or injure her. The court also held that the admission of the photos was proper since they were extremely probative and were offered to prove essential elements of stalking. The court noted that the evidence of the prior assault was not too remote in time to be admissible. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of stalking his ex-wife and placed defendant on five years probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the decision of the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama). The appellate court held that former Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(f) (now Ala.

The appellate court concluded that the language, the procedure, and the intent of the challenged statute, wherein felony driving under the influence was defined, were constitutional and did not violate the rights to due process or those establishing the doctrine of void for vagueness. The language of the challenged statute provided fair warning of what was forbidden and would inform ordinary people of the prohibited conduct.

The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, holding that the photographs admitted into evidence by the trial court were relevant to defendant's testimony that he and the victim struggled and that he accidentally shot her, and that they provided relevant information, based upon scientific testimony, about the location of the gun when the victim was shot.

Defendant was convicted of two counts of murder made capital because the murder was committed during a burglary in the first degree, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(4) (1975), and because the murder was committed during a rape in the first degree, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(3) (1975). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his custodial confession based on an alleged unreasonableness of the time he was in custody before being transferred to a youth detention facility because evidence established that defendant was capable of understanding his rights despite his mental and physical disabilities. The court, however, found that the trial court erred in admitting testimony over defendant's objection concerning swabs of DNA taken from the victim's body during an autopsy. The court stated that because the medical examiner who allegedly gathered the specimens did not testify at trial (1) defendant, in violation of the Confrontation Clause, was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the medical examiner regarding the specimens; and (2) the improper admission of the DNA evidence was highly prejudicial to defendant's defense of the murder and rape charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(17) (1975) was constitutional. The court found that there was a rational basis for the legislature's recognition of killers whose victims were killed while in a vehicle as a separate class, and for its decision that the offense should be punishable by either life imprisonment or the death penalty. The court also found that the statute did not proscribe any legally protected activities and did not involve any legally cognizable &quot;suspect&quot; class. The court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's request for a statistical expert to determine if the jury venire was a fair cross-section of the community because he did not make a threshold showing that there was a reasonable probability that the statistical expert would be of assistance to his fair cross-section challenge. Defendant only asserted that there was a variance between the percentage of young black males on the venire and the percentage in the community, and the trial court determined that young black males were not a distinctive group for fair cross-section purposes.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-4-2 (1975), and three counts of capital murder by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(10). By an 8-4 vote, the jury recommended that defendant be imprisoned for life without parole. Nonetheless, the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed from the capital murder conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's girlfriend and her two daughters were beaten and strangled to death. Although the girlfriend's two-year-old son was badly beaten, he managed to survive the attack. Soon thereafter, defendant stole a shotgun and shot himself, leaving a suicide note explaining &quot;the reason for this.&quot; Following a jury trial, in addition to the attempted murder of the boy, defendant was convicted of the capital murder of his girlfriend and her two daughters by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. Considering the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment without parole as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance, the trial court nevertheless decided to impose a sentence of death. Defendant appealed, raising numerous assignments of error, most of which were reviewed for plain error because defendant failed to object at trial. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the evidence was more than sufficient to convict defendant of the crimes. Moreover, the trial was free from reversible error. Finally, after independently weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the court concluded that the trial court appropriately imposed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama) on 14 separate indictments charging sexual offenses with underage girls. Defendant argued that the indictments should not have been consolidated, that there should have been a change of venue, that the tape-recordings of telephone conversations with a victim should have been suppressed, and that the second-degree rape statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-62, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a schoolteacher, was convicted of 14 sexual offenses involving underage female students. The court denied each of his arguments and affirmed his conviction. First, all 14 indictments could be consolidated under Ala. R. Crim. P. 13.3(c) because if each were tried separately, evidence of the other acts would have been relevant and admissible to show his motive, intent, and propensity for sexual misconduct. Second, denial of a change of venue was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion because defendant did not show actual prejudice. The jury voir dire excluded prejudiced individuals, leaving jurors that promised to render an impartial verdict; it was not required that jurors be ignorant of the newspaper accounts. Third, taped telephone conversations with a victim were admissible without Miranda warnings because Miranda only applied if defendant was being interrogated while in custody; it did not apply to voluntary statements while defendant was at liberty and being investigated, even if obtained by deception. Nor did &sect; 13A-6-62 violated equal protection simply because it imposed more severe penalties on men than on women; the difference reflected valid societal goals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction on all indictments. All of defendant's allegations of error were without merit and the court independently determined that the evidence was sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found that all of the issues raised in the petition were barred, except as to ineffective assistance of counsel, failure to turn over exculpatory evidence, and unconstitutionality of the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant asserted many arguments for post-conviction relief, including prejudice of the jury because portions of the Bible were read during deliberations, ineffective assistance of counsel, that the jury did not represent a cross-section of the community as required by the Sixth Amendment because of racial bias, and that the prosecution withheld evidence under Brady. The court affirmed the circuit court's denial of the defendant's petition, agreeing that most of the arguments were barred because they were raised and addressed at trial and because they could have been but were not raised on appeal. The court found that the jury's reading from the Bible and praying was not of such a character as to indicate bias or corruption or misconduct that might have affected the verdict or as to constitute prejudice. The court further ruled that the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were general and conclusory and that defendant asserted no facts to support the allegations. The court also found that defendant did not met his burden of proving that the jury was not a cross-section of the community or that the prosecution withheld any evidence that was exculpatory under Brady.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted error in the denial of a motion to dismiss a juror after a non-transcribed conference with the judge, admission of photos, jury instructions, comments by the prosecutor, and exclusion of evidence offered in mitigation during the penalty phase as hearsay. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence and remanded. The court held that the omitted conference with the juror was not a substantial and significant portion of the record and did not affect defendant's substantial rights. The court found the admission of gruesome photos to be within the trial court's discretion. The court found it was unnecessary to define &quot;intent&quot; and &quot;during&quot; to the jury. The court found no prejudice in comments such as &quot;I think&quot; and references to what was in the defendant's &quot;head&quot;.

Defendant challenged the ordinance's constitutionality. The court reversed the conviction and held that the antinoise ordinance, Mobile, Ala., Code &sect; 39-96 (1991), was unconstitutionally overbroad because the standard implemented by the city regulated without reasonable reference to time, place, and manner, and because it regulated constitutionally protected speech more broadly than necessary to achieve the governmental interest in regulating noise. The court found that, absent a permit, the ordinance was an absolute prohibition of any amplified sound that was plainly audible at greater than 50 feet anywhere in the city and at any time of day or night. The sweeping restriction of sound was not narrowly drawn, and restricted constitutionally protected speech beyond the point necessary to accomplish the objective for which the ordinance was created. The court suggested that the city, in amending the ordinance, insert an intent and purpose section in addition to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, and he was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion by impermissibly limiting the questions he propounded to prospective jurors during voir dire relating to their attitudes concerning the death penalty. The court ruled that the scope of the voir dire examination of veniremembers was left largely to the discretion of the trial court and was not disturbed on appeal on the ground that voir dire examination was limited absent an abuse of that discretion. Further, the court held that the right to question veniremembers regarding their qualifications to serve on the jury or their interest or bias was limited by propriety and pertinence and was to be exercised within the sound discretion of the trial court. The court affirmed the judgment convicting and sentencing defendant, concluding that in most of the instances cited by defendant, the trial court appeared to be attempting to clarify improper, leading, or misleading questions propounded by the defense and that the trial court was not attempting to unreasonably limit the scope of defendant's voir dire.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court resentenced defendant to 15 years' imprisonment but ordered a &quot;reverse split&quot; of the sentence. Accordingly, the court remanded a second time. While defendant's sentence was pending on the second remand, he filed a motion in the trial court to set aside the verdict and to grant a new trial. The court, upon receiving a return to its remand showing that the trial court had entered an order setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial, determined that the appeal had become moot and dismissed the appeal. The state filed an application for rehearing. The court found that the trial court had no jurisdiction to modify the original or base sentence imposed or to take any action beyond the express mandate of the court. It had no jurisdiction to grant a new trial or to attempt to dispose of the case in another manner.</SPAN></P>

The court also had no trouble concluding that defendant made &quot;unreasonable noise&quot; in the hallway of the courthouse for which he was ultimately arrested.

Defendant contended that the provisions of &sect; 32-5A-191, setting fines for a violation of that section, which were substantially increased in 1995 pursuant to 1995 Ala. Acts 95-784, were unconstitutional because they amounted to a revenue raising measure. The court disagreed, holding that the primary purpose of the increase in fines for DUI convictions brought about by 1995 Ala. Acts 95-784 was to deter persons from driving under the influence and further held that the primary purpose of the Act was not to collect revenue. Even though the DUI statute generated revenue in the form of fines, the revenue generated from the fines imposed under the statute was incidental to its primary purpose. 1995 Ala. Acts 95-784 was not a revenue bill within the meaning of Ala. Const. amend. IV, &sect; 70 (1901).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted her of capital murder, specifically the murder of a child under the age of 14, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(15) (1975), in connection with the death of her two and one-half year old daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, the evidence revealed that her daughter had had numerous medical problems that were attributed to an extremely rare genetic disorder, that defendant had told her boyfriend that she had given the child extra Phenobarbital and Benadryl because she would not stop crying, that a lethal concentration of Benadryl was present in the child's blood, and that the child's cause of death was Benadryl intoxication. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant's requested jury instruction concerning heat-of-passion manslaughter, as she had failed to advance any reasonable theory from the evidence to support the charge. Also, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for a jury selection consultant, as she had failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that an expert would have been of assistance to her defense or that the denial of a consultant had deprived her of a fair trial. Moreover, the State had presented adequate evidence to submit the capital murder case to the jury.

Moreover, if the trial court did err in admitting the confession, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that capital punishment had been upheld against constitutional attacks that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment. The record indicated that the jury venire was randomly selected from a list of licensed drivers in Shelby County. The court had repeatedly upheld this method of random selection against constitutional challenges. The prospective jurors in the case were questioned extensively regarding their knowledge of the case and any effect that pretrial publicity might have had on their ability to be fair and impartial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for the intentional murder during a kidnapping in the first degree, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. On appeal, defendant argued errors in all aspects of his trial and sentencing. The court found no reversible error and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. First, the court held that certain evidence, such as photographs of the victim, prior bad acts, defendant's flight, were admissible because they were relevant and went to show either motive or consciousness of guilt. Next, the court held that there was no gender or race discrimination in the selection of the jury because there was no indication of purposeful discrimination by the prosecutor. The court also found no error in the jury instructions, particularly on lesser-included offenses and on the theory of reasonable doubt. The court then held that the trial court properly considered mitigating and aggravating factors during the sentencing phase of defendant's trial. Finally, the court held that death by electrocution was not cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that none of defendant's substantial rights were violated warranting reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in the municipal court and appealed for a trial de novo in the circuit court. In the circuit court he entered a guilty plea to the charge and was sentenced. Defendant appealed asserting that the statute under which he was sentenced, Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191 (1975), was enacted after the city ordinance under which he was charged, and therefore it should not have applied to him. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that the city ordinance addressing the adoption of state law into the municipal code indicated that amendments to the state statutes referenced therein were to be encompassed in the ordinance. The court found that the sentence imposed pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191 was appropriate because that section allowed a municipality to charge persons who had committed a misdemeanor without having to formally adopt that state law as an ordinance of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) that convicted him, following a trial de novo, of driving under the influence pursuant to the Montgomery, Ala. Municipal Ordinance 125-79, which incorporated by reference Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191 (1975). Defendant also appealed his punishment of unsupervised probation for one year and payment of court costs and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal ordinance under which defendant was convicted for driving under the influence incorporated Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191 (1975). Defendant contended that the penalty provisions included in &sect; 32-5A-191 were enacted after the city's adoption of the ordinance, and, therefore, could not lawfully be applied to him. He contended that the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear his case based on the ordinance alone and not on the state statute, because, he said, the ordinance was not amended to reflect the amendments to &sect; 32-5A-191 enacted after the adoption of the ordinance. After a review of the record, the court noted that the uniform traffic ticket and complaint, the charging instrument, specifically charged defendant with violating one of those sections of &sect; 32-5A-191 that was adopted after the effective date of the ordinance in question. The court thus rejected defendant's argument. It held that the language of the ordinance clearly indicated that any amendments to the state statutes were to be encompassed in the ordinance; therefore, defendant's sentence, imposed pursuant to &sect; 32-5A-191, was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>
