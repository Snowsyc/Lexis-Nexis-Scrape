</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of sentence entered by the Criminal Court of Fayette County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed appellant's motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial and convicted appellant of embezzlement by a public officer, in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4822, and fraudulent conversion of property, in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4834.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions resulted from a shortage in the accounts at the county treasurer's office where she worked. The commonwealth presented evidence that appellant retained daily deposits and did not deposit funds. Appellant contended that the fraudulent conversion of property charge under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4834 was unfounded because the county was not a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4103, but the court held that political subdivisions were included within the definition of &quot;person.&quot; Appellant also contended that the embezzlement by a public officer charge was unfounded because she was not a public officer, but the court held that 18 Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4822 applied to any officer, employee, or agent of a political subdivision that exercised any control over public funds. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying her motion in arrest of judgment because the evidence was insufficient to show misapplication and because there was no demand made upon her to return the money. The court found that the circumstantial evidence amply supported that appellant withheld funds, altered deposit records, and reported a false robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for embezzlement by a public officer and fraudulent conversion of property because the commonwealth's evidence clearly established that appellant exercised improper control over public funds. However, the court reversed for resentencing because appellant was sentenced for an indefinite term at the state correctional institution under the Muncy Act, which was held to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner church applied to the trial court for authority to abandon its cemetery, re-inter the remains of the people buried there, and sell the land. Family members of those interred answered the petition. The trial court denied the petition, holding that the site could not be abandoned under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 48.1 (1959). The cemetery site was remote when purchased, but in the hundred years since that time became surrounded by housing projects and a university. The cemetery was not well maintained and the city had closed most of the roads providing access to the cemetery. The court rejected the claim of one plot owner that he owned his plot in fee simple. The court found that the cemetery had become angular and partly surrounded by improvements and could therefore be abandoned under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 48.1(1) (1959). The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of petitioner church's request for authority to abandon its cemetery because the cemetery was statutorily eligible for abandonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant criminal was convicted of sodomy and solicitation to commit sodomy, appellant petitioned the lower court for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (Act), 19 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1180-1 et seq. (Supp. 1966). Although the lower court appointed counsel to represent appellant, it dismissed appellant's petition without a hearing. Appellant contended that the lower court erred in dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief without having allowed counsel an opportunity to present written or oral argument in support of the petition. In disagreeing, the court stated that the Act's language did not mandate that counsel be given the opportunity to appear before the lower court to explain why an evidentiary hearing was warranted. The court did, however, remand the case for an evidentiary hearing because the lower court erred in dismissing appellant's allegations that evidence obtained pursuant to an unlawful arrest and search and seizure was used to procure his conviction. The court noted that the Act specifically provided that appellant could have raised these allegations in a post-conviction petition subsequent to his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the lower court's order denying appellant criminal's petition for post-conviction relief because appellant should have been allowed to raise allegations that commonwealth used unlawfully obtained evidence to secure his convictions. The Post Conviction Hearing Act, however, did not require the lower court to allow defense counsel an opportunity to present argument in support of the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and battery and was sentenced in July 1959 to a term of one and one-half to three years. He eventually was granted a new trial before the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania) where he was found guilty of assault and battery. The inmate appealed the order by which he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment, to begin at the expiration of his 1961 sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was released on parole in January 1961. He was again arrested on charges of assault and battery and was sentenced in June 1961 to a term of three to six years. This sentence was to begin after the completion of the one and one-half years remaining on his earlier sentence. In September 1961, he was convicted of a prison breach and was sentenced to one and one-half to three years, to begin at the expiration of the sentence imposed in June 1961. His petition for a writ of habeas corpus was granted in 1964, and the record was remanded for the new trial on the 1959 charge. In his petition before the court, he contended that he had to be given credit for the time served under the invalid 1959 sentence. The court held that because the inmate had been retried for the same acts, credits should be awarded. The Act of August 14, 1963, &sect; 1, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 898, required that a defendant convicted after a new trial had to receive credit for time served under an invalid sentence for the same criminal acts. The maximum sentence for assault and battery was two years. As a result of the proceedings, the inmate could have served up to two and one-half years for that offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer, a Maryland subsidiary of a Pennsylvania corporation, advanced money to the employee, a resident of Maryland, to assist him after he was injured in an automobile accident. Despite a written agreement to repay the money, the employee refused to return the money after the insurer began making workers' compensation payments. The employer instituted an action in foreign attachment in Pennsylvania, summoning the insurer as garnishee. The insurer continued to make payments to the employee and filed objections to jurisdiction, which were dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court was not required to adhere to Maryland laws that exempted such funds from attachment. The laws of attachment were governed by the law of the forum, not the law of the state where the debt arose. There was no constitutional compulsion to grant full faith and credit to exemptions created under the Maryland statute, nor was the attachment contrary to Pennsylvania's public policy. The possibility that the employee's right to receive future weekly payments could be modified through the settlement of his claim against a third party did not affect the unconditional nature of the weekly payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained an eye injury while working for the employer. He received workmen's compensation for total disability over the course of several months, pursuant to a compensation agreement. A final receipt was executed after his disability terminated. Sixteen years later, the employee applied for reinstatement of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, &sect; 413, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 772 (Supp.). The referee granted compensation, however, the Board reversed the referee's ruling. The court adopted the referee's ruling, finding that the claim was not time-barred. Although the statute of limitations applicable at the time of the original injury would have precluded the claim, the court held that the &quot;unlimited&quot; maximum benefit period &quot;statute of limitations&quot; in effect at the filing of the reinstatement petition, Act of February 28, 1956, P.L. 1120 (1955), was applicable. The Act was deemed to be procedural and therefore applicable to the employee's proceeding before the referee even though the petition involved an accident that occurred before its enactment. The law in effect on the date that the petition for reinstatement controlled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juveniles contended that the trial court was without power to order their confinement at the location ordered because the legislature designated the authority to transfer to and from the location to have been placed with the Department of Justice. The court rejected this contention, holding that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 542.3 placed the administrative authority of the institutions under control of the Department of Justice in the Deputy Commissioner for Treatment of the Bureau of Correction, and had not taken any power of sentencing and commitment from the courts. The determination of the question of whether one was mentally defective and had criminal tendencies and as to where he should have been committed was vested in the courts under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 541-3. Although the proceedings began by a petition for discharge of the juveniles from another institution, it culminated in an original proceeding as to acts committed while the juveniles were in custody, a determination of delinquency, that they were mentally defective with criminal tendencies, and a commitment as a result of these findings. This was not a transfer but an original act.</SPAN></P>

At a hearing de novo, the trial court excluded the Board's only evidence as having been unlawfully obtained and sustained licensee's appeal. The Board appealed conceding that the evidence in question was acquired by police detectives pursuant to an invalid search warrant and could not be used in a court of law, but arguing that the evidence could be considered at a Board citation hearing. The Board argued that holding a license was a privilege, and thus, due process did not require that the evidence obtained through an invalid warrant be excluded from the Board's consideration. The court found, however, that the Board was empowered to impose a fine that was equal to or greater than that which could be imposed under the criminal law. Thus, evidence that could not be used in a court of law could not be used to impose a penalty of equal or greater severity by the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a woman, was initially sentenced to one to four years imprisonment after being found guilty of robbery. Thirty one days later, the trial court vacated the first sentence and sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term as required by the Muncy Act (Act). The practical effect to defendant was that the Act caused her to have been given a significantly harsher sentence, solely because she was a woman, than a male defendant would likely have received under similar circumstances. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the Act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because the legislature rationally based the Act on its conclusion that, notwithstanding the disparate effect upon women as compared to men, indeterminate sentences needed to be imposed on women as a class, allowing the time of incarceration to be matched to the necessary treatment in order to provide more effective rehabilitation., and that accordingly, the trial court's judgment of sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pleading guilty to a charge of assault with intent to ravish, defendant was sentenced to a term of one day to life under the Barr-Walker Act, Pa.

Ann. tit.18, &sect; 4722, based on a psychiatric determination that he was a danger as a result of his direct sexual aggressive behavior. After the sentence was vacated, a new hearing was held in which the assistant superintendent of a state hospital testified that the original report was prepared by other doctors under his supervision and that he also had some personal contact with defendant during the course of the examination. The doctor also reiterated his finding that defendant was not mentally ill but did present a danger to society. In reluctantly vacating the sentence and finding the Act unconstitutional, the court held that indeterminate treatment sentencing was a separate criminal proceeding and required a full judicial hearing with all due process procedural safeguards, including counsel, an opportunity to be heard and to confront witnesses, a right to cross-examination, and for defendant to offer evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following their convictions for assault with intent to rob, defendants appealed and presented several challenges to the validity of their convictions. First, defendants argued that error occurred because they were not given a sufficient number of challenges as to the jury venire. The court rejected this argument and noted that jointly indicted defendants received the same number of total challenges as a single defendant. Second, defendants argued that error occurred when the trial court refused to allow them to call an alibi witness. The court rejected this argument and found that defendants were not entitled to call an alibi witness because they had failed to provide prior notice of this witness to the prosecutor. Further, the law that required defendants to give prior notice of alibi witnesses was constitutional. Third, the court found that the refusal of the trial court to sequester the Commonwealth's witnesses and to confine the jury was not error, as defendants failed to show any prejudice resulting from the trial court's actions here.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially held that the county health department had the authority to enact regulations governing milk and milk products because the state Milk Control Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 700j-101 et seq., did not preclude local authorities from promulgating milk regulations that were at least as strict as the state regulations. However, the court found Allegheny County, Pa., Health Department Rules and Regulations 505 to be an invalid exercise of the county's police power because it prohibited the sale in the county of any milk that was not pasteurized. The assumption that unpasteurized milk could not be made safe for human consumption was inconsistent with the state legislature's regulations governing categories of milk. While the court found that the permit requirement of Allegheny County, Pa., Health Department Rules and Regulations 504(A) was not unconstitutional per se, defendant was entitled to a permit because the testimony showed that the only reason defendant was denied a permit was because the health department issued no permits for raw milk. Such a criterion was, in itself, insufficient to deny a permit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed an order of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which remanded him to the New York authorities based on the procedures provided in the Compact Act of June 25, 1937, P.L. 2086, Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the 30-day provision of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 670-303 (1945) did not apply. Under the Act of 1945, an appeal had to be filed within 30 days after the filing of the report. The court rejected the contention that it only applied when the parties waived the waiting period. The filing of exceptions to a viewer's report was independent of the right to take an appeal from the report, and there was no inconsistency in filing exceptions and in entering an appeal at the same time. The owner further contended that the Act of 1945, as interpreted, was unconstitutional as violative of Pa. Const. art. 3, &sect; 3, in that the subject matter of appeals from the report of viewers was not mentioned in the title of the act. The Act of 1945 was a complete embodiment of the law insofar as state highways are concerned. It was not necessary to mention every provision of the bill in the title. Because the appeal from the viewers' report was filed beyond the time provided by the Act of 1945, it was properly quashed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which granted a supersedeas, allowed defendant's appeal, and reversed an order of a secretary of revenue. The secretary of revenue had informed defendant that his operator's license was revoked following his conviction by a trial court for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary of revenue received the pertinent information on a form furnished by a department, signed, and dated by a deputy clerk of courts. There was no possible reason for the court of common pleas to have sustained defendant's appeal even if the court of the common pleas had jurisdiction, which it did not. Defendant never questioned his conviction. Admitting his conviction, he had no standing to question the mere ministerial act of the secretary of revenue in revoking his operator's license as Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 616 required. The court of common pleas improperly concluded that a person who had his license revoked for one year was deprived of the privilege of applying for a license during that period. Therefore, the person was entitled to appeal from the order of revocation. The court held that an operator's privilege could not be revoked for one year if he could obtain a new license within that period. The privilege, not a card that the person carried in his pocket, was revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the court of common pleas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Without the assistance of counsel, defendant pled guilty to assault and attempted robbery. After he served three years, he was paroled. He was then discharged from parole. He filed a petition to set aside the conviction on the ground that he had not intelligently waived his right to counsel, he was coerced into confessing, and he was drugged at the time of the incident. The petition was brought forth in order to enable him to reduce a sentence imposed on him as a second felony offender in New York. After various appeals and remands, the petition was granted. In reversing the order, the court found that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over defendant or over his judgment of sentence when it granted the petition. There was no jurisdiction because such jurisdiction terminated when defendant was discharged from parole. Since defendant's sentence was fully executed, the power of the trial court to modify or amend the sentence or to impose a new sentence was gone, whether or not the term had expired. The trial court could not proceed to adjudication when there was no subject matter on which the judgment could operate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Barr-Walker Act, January 8, 1952, P.L. 1851, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1166 created an alternative sentencing procedure for sex offenders by assigning psychiatrists to examine them, by allowing them to be confined to a mental institution for an indeterminate period of between one day and the rest of their lives, and by requiring periodic review by the Pennsylvania Department of Welfare and the Pennsylvania Board of Parole to determine whether parole was appropriate. In their petitions, defendants argued that the Act violated the due process provisions of the 14th Amendment and the title provisions of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The court explained that the Act neither created nor described a crime but merely provided alternative sentencing for someone who had been convicted, with all of the elements of due process, of a crime. The Act was neither cruel and unusual nor vague and indefinite: its procedural provisions were clear. Nor did it punish a condition; instead, the Act sought to rehabilitate and treat habitual sex offenders while protecting the public from them. That the title did not enumerate the applicable sex crimes did not invalidate the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the secretary was not only authorized but was required to reject all certificates of examination made by chiropractors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed an order of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Chester County (Pennsylvania), which vacated a sentence imposed by the jury upon defendant to pay the costs of a criminal prosecution after it acquitted him of wantonly pointing and discharging a firearm in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4716.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fired a gun in the air. The Commonwealth charged defendant. Defendant claimed he had shot a blank from a starting pistol. The jury acquitted defendant, but ordered him to pay the costs of the prosecution as provided by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1222. Defendant moved to set aside the sentence on the basis that &sect; 1222 violated U.S. Const. amend XIV. The trial court set aside the sentence. The Commonwealth appealed. The court reversed and reinstated the sentence. Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1222 or a similar provision had been in force since the earliest days of the Commonwealth. While other state constitutions prohibited the practice, there was no prohibition in the Pennsylvania Constitution. The constitutionality of &sect; 1222 had been upheld after the adoption of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and that precedent was binding. The claim that the provision was inserted in error was refuted by subsequent re-enactment. There was no unlawful delegation of legislative power. The classification of crimes into misdemeanors and felonies was not unconstitutional. The imposition of costs was not punishment for an undefined crime but a recognition that defendant was responsible for the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court, which had set aside the sentence that required defendant to pay the costs of the prosecution. The court reinstated the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4603. On appeal, defendant complained that the trial court erred in rejecting certain documentary evidence and depositions to establish his defense that the machines had been purchased for resale to customers in England, and that conversion of the machines to free play devices for foreign shipment was protected by the federal Constitution, and by &sect; 2 of the Johnson Act of January 2, 1951, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1172. The court affirmed and held that defendant waived his complaint regarding the trial court's rejection of documentary evidence and depositions because the complaint was not advanced in the post-trial motions or passed upon by the trial court. Matters not properly raised in the trial court could not be invoked on appeal. The court held that even though the machines may have been intended for interstate commerce, they were not beyond the operation of the penal laws of the Commonwealth. A police statute was not unconstitutional merely because it indirectly involved or burdened interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The supervisors appealed to the common pleas court, which set aside the surcharge. The auditors sought review. The court modified and reinstated the auditor's surcharge of the township supervisors for the excess compensation they paid themselves. Otherwise, the court affirmed judgment and held that common pleas court was proper in holding the treasurer as a de facto officer. The court opined that the borough received valuable services from the treasurer, and under the circumstances, was required to pay for the services. The court opined that the township supervisors were public officials that were elected to township offices under a law that fixed their maximum compensation. The court concluded that they had no authority to pass legislation that set their salaries in excess of that amount.</SPAN></P>

The Commission approved the temporary discontinuance of the service route and the county, city and a route user filed objections and an appeal was taken to the court. The Commission and railway company filed a motion to quash the appeal on the ground that the order was interlocutory and not appealable, and that the county, city and user had not standing to appeal. The court refused the motion to quash the appeal and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings. The court concluded that the Commission, in preliminary ordering the cessation of service before completion of the hearing on the subject, acted arbitrarily and beyond it general or specific powers in the case. The court found no emergency or even a particular urgency in the present case to warrant the Commission's order before the completion of the hearing. The court ruled that further testimony and evidence was necessary in order to determine the railway company's alleged loss in the case and to determine if public need for the service still remained.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the broad language of the taxing part of the school district's resolution included a variety of activities that were not necessarily amusements and specifically included admissions to fairgrounds. Although the fair included agricultural and horticultural exhibits, the fair also included a midway with rides, games, and concession stands that were not directly related to agricultural or horticultural exhibits. The fair charged a general admission fee to the public. The court held that the taxing ordinance was a valid exercise of the school district's taxing authority and that the fairgrounds was required to pay the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff first class township had sued out a scire facias sur to enforce a municipal lien against defendant property owners. The owners defended under &sect; 7 of the Municipal Claims Act of May 16, 1923, P.L. 207, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 7141. The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) entered an order that made absolute the township's rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defense of the township's claim against the owners for the cost construction of a sidewalk in front of their premises, the owners claimed that the township gave them no notice and no opportunity to construct their own sidewalk as is required by &sect; 7 of the Municipal Claims Act of May 16, 1923, P.L. 207, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 7141. The township contended that &sect; 7 had been superseded by &sect; 2303 of The First Class Township Code of June 24, 1931, P.L. 1206, as amended, May 27, 1949, P.L. 1955, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 57303, which authorized the township to lay the sidewalk and assess the abutting owner for the cost without affording the owner an opportunity to lay his own sidewalk. The common pleas court made absolute a rule for judgment for the township on its motion for a judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, which the court held was a final appealable order. In upholding the judgment on review, the court held that the Township Code did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7 because it was not local or special legislation; rather, the Township Code provision had been made a general law by reason of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 34.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the licensee's argument that it was unconstitutional to prohibit the employment of barmaids in restaurants when their employment was permitted in clubs. The court concluded that the legislature could establish different rules for club licensees and other licensees and could allow barmaids in clubs and not in restaurants. The Constitution did not require legislatures to reflect sociological insight, or shifting social standards, any more than it required them to keep abreast of the latest scientific standards.

Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4732, the Commonwealth obtained an order requiring the father to support his illegitimate child after the child reached 14 years of age. Upon appeal, the trial court's order was affirmed. The court held that there were no limits to the father's obligation to support his child. Thus, the obligation of the father to support his child was merely suspended while he was paying child support pursuant to the order that was issued in the fornication and bastardy proceedings. The court also ruled that the father's obligation to pay support to the child after the child became 14 did not place defendant under jeopardy twice and did not subject him to cruel or unusual punishment. Also, the court held that &sect; 4732 was not improperly applied to him retroactively. Thus, no constitutional rights of defendant were violated by the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

The city imposed the penalty for the proper municipal purpose of enforcing its civil service provisions.

Although the legislature could not delegate its power to make a law, it could confer authority in connection with the execution of the law. That was what the amendment to &sect; 404 of the Liquor Code did. It gave the Board the authority to determine the fact of whether issuance of a liquor license would be detrimental to a neighborhood.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant heirs appealed the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) that was entered in favor of plaintiff purchasers. The purchasers had brought an action to quiet title to certain real estate they purchased at a tax foreclosure sale. The heirs were the surviving children and the legal heirs of the owner of the property, who had died.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the heirs were living at the property at issue. No notice of the tax sale was sent or delivered to any of the heirs. The notice was directed to the estate of the heirs' father in care of the wife of one of the heirs. A young child of one of the heirs signed the registered mail notice. The lower court determined that the provisions of the General County Assessment Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 5020-417 (1933), with regard to notice to the terre-tenant of the property, were not complied with. Therefore, the tax sale was invalid. The court agreed and held that a valid sale for unpaid taxes was not possible without some form of notice to the owner or the terre-tenant of the property. The court found that the tax assessor had not ascertained the owner of the real estate, even with having some knowledge of a change of ownership because of addressing the notice to an estate. The court held that there was no evidence that notice actually reached any of the heirs with the notice having been addressed to the estate of the deceased owner and delivered to a child. As a result, the court held that the tax sale under which the purchasers claimed title was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case to the lower court for the purpose of entering a decree in favor of the heirs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the order of the Municipal Court of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which dismissed its motion to strike off an appeal filed by defendant in plaintiff's action of trespass for property damage in which plaintiff had recovered judgment and defendant had appealed. Plaintiff argued that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 913a (1956) violated the Pennsylvania Constitution by restricting the right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an action in trespass and recovered judgment. Defendant appealed, and plaintiff filed a motion to strike off the appeal on the ground that &sect; 913a limited the right of appeal from a magistrate's judgment to cases where the judgment was in excess of $ 100. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's motion, holding that &sect; 913a did not apply to appeals from magistrates to municipal courts. Plaintiff appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that it could sustain the trial court's decision for a different reason than that which was assigned and that &sect; 913a was in plain conflict with the mandate of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 (1894). The effect of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 913a (1956) was to prohibit appeals as a matter of right where the judgment given by a magistrate, alderman, or justice of the peace did not exceed $ 100, excluding costs. The provision in &sect; 913a for appeals on &quot;special allowance&quot; did not save it because the right of trial by jury was not a matter of judicial discretion. The Pennsylvania Legislature could not constitutionally impose any provisions substantially restrictive of the sacred and inherent right of trial by jury, which was to remain inviolate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the license revocation penalty in &sect; 616 of the Vehicle Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 616, and the license suspension penalty in &sect; 618 of the Code could apply to the same offense. The legislature authorized the Secretary to suspend the license of an operator for the same offense for which it provided for a mandatory revocation. There was nothing in the state or federal constitutions to prevent a double penalty. The court held that it was not double jeopardy under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and did not violate the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution to apply the penalties of both &sect; 616 and &sect; 618 of the Code to the same violation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner in a habeas corpus case filed a petition for leave to file appeal without payment of the statutory filing fee. The court denied the petition. The court found that the statute requiring the payment of filing fees, the Pennsylvania Act of May 19, 1897, P.L. 67, &sect; 3, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 1135, was constitutional as applied to appeals in habeas corpus cases. Also, the court noted that the prisoner was in a Pennsylvania State penitentiary. As a prisoner in such an institution he received an allowance from the Commonwealth. Since the prisoner returned to the penitentiary as a convicted parole violator he received about $ 330. Although he spent all of it except about $ 5, had he not spent it he would have been able to pay the $ 12 filing fee. Under these circumstances the Commonwealth did not foreclose the prisoner access to the court. Finally, the prisoner's latest conviction was reviewed by the court. The prisoner brought this habeas corpus action raising substantially the same questions previously presented while the review of his conviction and sentence were pending before the Supreme Court. If indigent, the prisoner was not entitled to overlapping free reviews.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a workers' compensation claim, which a referee disallowed.

The employer appealed to the court of common pleas, which dismissed the appeal holding that order was interlocutory. On appeal, the court reversed and remitted for an order reversing the grant of a rehearing. The court held that the board lacked authority to consider the employee's petition for rehearing because it was filed too late and was barred by &sect; 426 of The Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act, 1915 Pa. Laws 736, as last amended by 77 P.S. &sect; 871 . The amendment was not intended to apply retroactively to petitions filed before its effective date. The statute was a statute of repose that had to be applied prospectively. The board's power to entertain a petition for review ceased after one year after its last order. The legislature could not have revived such a claim even if it had intended to. Although such an interlocutory order would not usually have been appealable, the board considered the petition in violation of its authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff the Commonwealth sought review of orders of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania) sustaining defendants' motion to quash indictments that charged defendants with engaging in budget planning business in violation of The Act of 1955, P.L. 755, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4897.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were budget planners. As a result of their activity, defendants were indicted for violating The Act of 1955, P.L. 755 (Pennsylvania), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4897, which made the act of engaging in budget planning a misdemeanor. Defendants filed a motion to quash the indictments on the ground that &sect; 4897 was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion, and the Commonwealth appealed the decision contending that it was erroneous. The Commonwealth argued that &sect; 4897 was a proper exercise of its police power to protect citizens from potentially illegal conduct of budget planners. The court noted that for an exercise of the police power to be valid the law must not be unreasonable, unduly oppressive, or patently beyond the necessities of the case, and the means which it employed must have a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to have been obtained. Since &sect; 4897 prohibited all budget planning activity under the theory that there might somewhere, sometime be a dishonest budget planner, the court held that this was not a proper exercise of the police power. Section 4897 was properly declared unconstitutional, and the orders were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced for felonious assault to the state penitentiary for a term of 3 to 6 years. After completing his minimum sentence, defendant was paroled by the parole board to serve &quot;back time.&quot; At the expiration of that term, the parole board recommitted defendant to the state penitentiary as a parole violator. Defendant commenced a habeas corpus proceeding to obtain his release from the state penitentiary. The lower court directed that the defendant be discharged. The Commonwealth, by and through its attorney general, appealed and the court reversed the order and dismissed the petition. The court held that what the legislature must have intended by &quot;at liberty on parole&quot; was not at liberty from all confinement but at liberty from confinement on the particular sentence for which defendant was reentered as a parole violator. The court noted that if the legislature intended to change this policy, it would have done so directly, and that such a change should not have been inferred by interpretation of a provision in 61 P.S. &sect; 331.21a that made no reference to the credits to have been given a parole violator who served time on other offenses after reentry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Pennsylvania Milk Control Commission, sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 5 of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which reversed an order by which the Commission suspended appellee milk dealer's license for violating the Commission's Rules of Trade Practices. The Commission found that the dealer had lent refrigerator equipment, free of charge, to many of its wholesale customers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court accepted the contention that Rule of Trade Practices A-1 was unreasonable and illegal. On appeal by the Commission, the court did not agree with the trial court that the Rule failed to meet the test of constitutionality. The court held that the dealer had failed to show that the Rule was unconstitutional. The purpose of the Milk Control Law of April 28, 1937 was to assure a sufficient supply of pure milk, primarily through price regulation and control. The court also held that the constitutionality of the Law seemed to be firmly established. To maintain an established price, it was necessary to prevent a seller, such as the dealer, from giving to a purchaser anything of value in addition to the milk. When the dealer furnished the refrigeration equipment, the wholesalers could sell the milk below the fixed price. The amount of money involved was not de minimis, as the cost of milk refrigeration was substantial. The court did not agree with the dealer that its loaned equipment had no relation to maintaining an established milk price. Because the dealer admitted its violation, the court had no alternative but to reinstate the Commission's order suspending the dealer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and affirmed the order of the Commission by which the dealer's license was suspended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a corporation that engaged in the business of a general steamship agent, and it argued that the city tax was unconstitutional and invalid under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the Commerce Clause, and U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2, the Import-export Clause. In reversing, the court agreed. First, the court noted that the taxpayer's business was to solicit cargo for shipment by steamship and passenger travel and that it also exercised a degree of control over the loading and unloading of cargo and the berthing and dispatching of vessels. Applying precedent, the court noted that such activities were incident to the movement of cargo and thus constituted a continuation of the transport of goods in interstate and foreign commerce. Next, the court found that the tax on the taxpayer's gross receipts was an impermissible tax upon the commerce itself and was, therefore, invalid under the Commerce Clause. In addition, the court found that the tax on the taxpayer's gross receipts violated the Import-export Clause, which prohibited any state from laying duties on imports or exports except as to costs necessary to cover the state's inspection laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted, tried, and convicted by a jury for the violation of the Act of May 15, 1939, P.L. 134, as amended, 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1271 et seq., otherwise known as the Fireworks Law, which prohibited, except in certain cases, the sale, offering or exposing for sale and use of fireworks. The trial court granted defendant's motion in arrest of judgment, holding that the law was unconstitutional, as it related to the prohibition of the sale, the offering for sale, or the use of fireworks by the general public. On appeal, the court determined that, if its inquiry had been properly limited, the trial court would have found no basis for declaring the law unconstitutional on the grounds that it related to conduct which was beyond the police power of the legislature to prohibit, and that it was vague and indefinite. The court held that the toy cannons in defendant's case clearly came within the statutory definition of fireworks and that the prohibition of their sale was directly related to the promotion of the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. The court concluded that the statute was not vague and indefinite as it applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the classification of pinball machines and admissions to drive-in theaters and roller skating rinks was constitutionally permissible. The court held that the school district could distinguish between businesses so long as it did so in good faith and so long as the classification did not make an arbitrary or unjust distinction. The court held that the school district was not required to treat all forms of amusement in a similar fashion.

The court found that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Law, 66 P.S. &sect; 1179, authorized the commission to impose upon the commonwealth the cost of relocating utilities pursuant to a highway construction project. The court held that the relocation of utility facilities fell within the term expense of such construction under 66 P.S. &sect; 1181, so that the commonwealth was required to pay for the relocation.

The State had the power to prohibit public amusements and exhibitions on Sundays. Defendant next contended that he was denied due process and equal protection.

The trial court reversed the Board's decision, concluding that the Board had not proven its case by clear, precise, and indubitable evidence and that it did not find as a fact that the club sold liquor or malt and brewed beverages on the licensed premises. The trial court based its decision on the lack of evidence and the fact that no analysis was made of the beverage sold to enforcement officers to show that it was a malt or brewed beverage. The court reversed, holding that the trial court committed error in placing too great a burden of proof on the Board. The court stated that the Board's burden was based on civil rather than criminal proceedings, and it had the authority to revoke or suspend the club's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a securities dealer with its principal place of business out of state and a branch office in Philadelphia. It was not required under &sect; 2 of The Pennsylvania Securities Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 748, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, &sect; 31 et seq. to be licensed as a securities dealer in Pennsylvania. The city collected a mercantile license fee and mercantile taxes from the taxpayer under the Philadelphia Mercantile License Tax Ordinance, Philadelphia, Pa. Code of General Ordinances ch. 19-1000, for which the taxpayer sought a refund. The Revenue Commissioner of Philadelphia, the Tax Review Board of Philadelphia, and the trial court denied the refund. The court affirmed. The court held that the city could collect taxes from the taxpayer because the Sterling Act of Aug. 5, 1932, P.L. 45, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 4613, allowed such collection only against taxpayers or their property which were not subject to state tax or license fee. The city tax ordinance did not create an unconstitutional classification under Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant managed a movie theater. An uncut version of a film, which had previously been refused approval by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors, was exhibited at the theater. The trial court found that the film depicted a series of dancing acts, which were cheap, lewd, obscene, and indecent. On appeal, defendant argued that the film did not constitute an exhibition in violation of &sect; 528. In addition, he argued that &sect; 528 was unconstitutional because it contained no definition of the conduct proscribed and because the language of &sect; 528 was so broad that its sanctions applied to conduct within the protection of U.S. Const. amend. I, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Pa. Const. art. I. The court found that the finding of the trial court that the film was obscene was supported by the evidence. Section 528 was not unconstitutional. The words used in &sect; 528 had well-settled connotations that could be applied by the exercise of ordinary common sense and reason. The type of films that could be lawfully exhibited could be restricted. The right of free speech was not absolute. Lewd, obscene, and indecent speech could be prevented and punished without raising any constitutional problem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge was based on a telephone call. The prosecutrix testified that defendant not only identified himself but that she recognized his voice. He stated to her that he would get her. She further testified that she was put in fear by the threat because of the knowledge that defendant had beaten his wife and that she was afraid that she would get similar treatment. Defendant was convicted. The trial court ordered him to post a surety bond. Defendant contended that the Act of March 31, 1860, P.L. 427, &sect; 6, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 23, and the Act of March 18, 1909, P.L. 42, &sect; 1, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 24, were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that where there was a malicious intent to do harm and the prosecutrix was put in fear of her safety, the law did not require an actual assault before affording protection. The expression &quot;I'll get you,&quot; together with the background information, fairly led to the conclusion that it was not intended merely as a friendly gesture. The Act of 1909 qualified the Act of 1860, by establishing a standard under which the Act of 1860 should operate. The standard created was a reasonable one. The Acts were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that no statute or ordinance specifically precluded a right turn at those intersections and that to permit the judgment of an individual police officer to supersede the traffic statutes and ordinances was an unlawful delegation of legislative power and thus unconstitutional. The court held that the officers had authority to direct defendant to proceed straight through the intersections under the conditions of traffic existing at the time of these offenses. While it was true that an ordinance making some specific regulation of traffic, such as prohibiting a right turn at all or at designated times, was unenforceable unless the requisite signs were posted, it did not follow that the specific authority of a police officer had to be posted on an official sign before he could act to direct traffic in an emergency or to expedite congested traffic.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 582.1 et seq. The court found that the toilet paper, napkins, cups and similar products which were sold by the taxpayer and used by the purchasers, or their employees, on their own premises should be classified as retail business for the purpose of determining the tax rate regardless of whether they were sold to a merchant, physician or any other person. Because the record was inadequate regarding the taxpayer's sale, the court made a determination of what sales constituted wholesale transactions and what sales constituted retail transactions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed the prisoner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus against appellee prison warden. The prisoner had been serving a sentence of two years imposed by a county alderman on a guilty plea to a charge of assault and battery. The prisoner claimed that the alderman did not have authority to sentence him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Pennsylvania Act of May 1, 1861, P.L. 682 gave the alderman, whose powers were the same as a justice of the peace, authority to impose the sentence. The Act of 1861 granted jurisdiction to justices of the peace to hear and determine certain offenses defined in the Act of March 31, 1860, P.L. 382. On appeal, the prisoner contended that even if the alderman did have jurisdiction to sentence him, the maximum penalty that could be imposed was one year under the Act of 1860. In reversing, the court held that the Act of 1860 was repealed by &sect; 1201 of the Penal Code of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 5201. In all instances, the penalties for the offenses traced from the Act of 1860 to The Penal Code of 1939 were changed. Because the Act of 1861 was a penal provision, the court had to strictly construe it. Thus, the court found that when the legislature passed the Penal Code of 1939 and repealed the Act of 1860, it did not intend that the justices of the peace should have jurisdiction to sentence for violations of the provisions of the Code. Thus, the alderman could not apply the two-year sentence set forth in the Penal Code of 1939.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and discharged the prisoner.</SPAN></P>

There was no presentment to or indictment by the grand jury as the procedure in the statute provided otherwise. Defendants contended that the absence of a bill of indictment by the grand jury rendered the statutory procedure invalid under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and U.S. Const. amend. V. Defendants argued that the offenses charged were indictable offenses that could have been punished at common law. Defendants asserted that the test for determining which offenses were indictable as common law offenses was whether the offenses might have been punished at common law. The court disagreed that the charges against them, in the absence of the statute, would have been indictable as common law offenses. Except as such conduct had been prohibited by statute, the conduct with which defendants were charged did not offend against the public peace, morals, or domestic order of the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proceedings began on complaints filed against the utility company's proposed new tariffs and an investigation by the Commission, on its own motion, to determine the reasonableness and lawfulness of proposed and existing rates and charges. On the issue of accrued depreciation and depletion, the court rejected the city's contention that the Commission was bound to accept the book reserve. The city next attacked the Commission's annualization and adjustment of revenues and expenses for test year customer changes. The court determined that the Commission had a wide area of discretion. The court found no error in the Commission's determination of the incremental expense necessary to serve the customer. The court concluded that the evidence sustained the general method used in designing the rate structure. The court found, however, that the utility company was not permitted to pass along the expenses of its parent corporation to the customers. The court held that sums in excess of a fair return on the utility's fair value that the customers of the utility were required to contribute toward the operating expenses of the parent corporation were without justification.</SPAN></P>

The Register sought payment from the County for the increase in salary for the month of January, 1956. The lower court held that Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 13, which prohibited the increase or decrease in salary of public officers after their election or appointment, was not applicable, and therefore, the Register was entitled to the increased salary. On review, the court reversed judgment and held that the prohibition in Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 13 was applicable to those persons who had been elected to offices which were occupied by public officers, and that it became effective immediately after the election. Therefore, the effect of the Act was to increase the Register's compensation after his election, and this was prohibited by the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the premises at issue were located in a neighborhood that was almost completely residential. It further noted that the lower court found that the premises were situated at the end of block of business establishments. Further, the court remarked that children continuously passed the premises on their way to a school and a park. The court concluded that the Board did not abuse its discretion in refusing the application for the transfer. The court rejected the applicant's argument that because the premises themselves were zoned commercial, the Board could not refuse the transfer on the ground that the neighborhood itself was residential in character. The court commented that a municipality could not, in the guise of a zoning ordinance, regulate the business of dispensing liquor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance provided that the building line of any structure or alterations to an existing structure had to have been set back at least 10 feet from the street line. The permit authorized would permit the alteration of the building so as to add to the front thereof a well designed and artistic business front within the 10 foot setback space. The testimony revealed that approximately half of the buildings on the block were, and had been since the passage of the zoning ordinance, built out to the street line. The court rejected the zoning board's contention that the applicant had to prove hardship. The court reasoned that an applicant for a special exception did not need to carry the burden of proving unnecessary hardship. It was when seeking a variance that the applicant therefor had to show that unnecessary hardship would result unless the variance was permitted. The court held that to require the applicant to observe the setback provisions of the zoning ordinance when the properties of many other owners failed to comply would have been most unfair and the zoning board's action in requiring strict compliance should have been characterized as unreasonable and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in not quashing the indictment on the ground that he was not afforded the right to examine the jury commissioners as to the method of selecting jurors. The court rejected such contention because the provisions of the Act of May 10, 1949, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 1251, afforded no such right to defendant. Defendant also argued that the charge was improper because the trial court failed to define &quot;possession.&quot; The court also rejected that argument because the word &quot;possession&quot; had a common meaning that was generally understood and the charge fully covered the essentials of the offense. Moreover, because the question was not included in the motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, it was not properly raised for the first time on appeal. Finally, the court ruled that &sect; 12 of the Act of July 11, 1917, as amended by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 865, under which sentence was imposed, was not an unconstitutional invasion of the powers of the judiciary by the legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were proprietors of a restaurant who sold lemon pies made from Jell-O Brand lemon filling. Because the pies were adulterated with yellow coal tar color, defendants were charged with a violation of the General Food Law. Following defendants' convictions before a justice of the peace, a court of quarter sessions held a hearing de novo, found them guilty, and ordered them to pay a fine and costs. On further appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendants clearly violated &sect;&sect; 3 and 8 of the General Food Law and Regulation 1003 of the Pennsylvania Department because they sold pies adulterated with artificial coloring. Based on testimony from the Commonwealth's expert baker witness, there was sufficient evidence to find that the purpose of the dye was to conceal inferiority in quality. Although defendants used a product that had been legally shipped into the state, the addition of eggs, water and pie crust made it a new product that caused the Jell-O filling to lose its interstate characteristic and become entirely intrastate in every respect. Because control of foodstuff was within the Commonwealth's police power, defendants' convictions were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent warden appealed from the order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 1 of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), granting petitioner relator a writ of habeas corpus and discharging him from custody. The issue was whether the amending Act of July 29, 1953, P.L. 1447, &sect; 1 (1953 amendment), enacted after the relator was sentenced, and which limited a general sentence to the state reformatory to six years, applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relator was originally given a general sentence on a burglary conviction to the Pennsylvania Industrial School, the state reformatory, under the Act of April 28, 1887, P.L. 63, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 485. During his incarceration, he was paroled, recommitted, reparoled, and recommitted. Seven years after his original sentence, he was transferred to the state prison, to serve the remainder of his 20-year maximum sentence. That same year, the 1887 statute was amended by the Act of July 29, 1953, P.L. 1447, &sect; 1. The amendment provided for a maximum general sentence to the reformatory of six years. The relator argued that the amendment should be applied retroactively and that he should therefore be discharged. The court found that the relator, by his parole violations, had demonstrated his lack of fitness to return to society. The court also found that he had never applied for parole. It held that habeas corpus was not a substitute for parole. It also held unanimously that, based on principals of statutory construction and the public interest, the legislature had not intended the amendment to apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed an appeal from a decision of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review denying certain unemployment benefits. The record showed that the employee was laid off due to lack of work, and about a month before the lay off, the employee was granted one week of vacation and was paid for two other weeks for which he was entitled. The Board disallowed benefits for one week upon the basis of a regulation which provided that vacation paid to an employee was to be allocated to the first period of otherwise compensable unemployment occurring within 90 days following such payment. The court affirmed the Board's decision and concluded that the Department of Unemployment Compensation had the power to determine by the appropriate regulations the periods for which vacation pay should be deemed remuneration. The court held that the regulation, adopted under &sect; 4(u) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, was not arbitrary or discriminatory, and it was not an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power. The court ruled that the Law was not intended to create a situation whereby an employee could receive both vacation pay and unemployment compensation for the same period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed an application for unemployment compensation. The record showed that the employee worked the afternoon shift and she received notice of a lay-off due to lack of work on that shift. The employee was notified that work would be available for her on the morning shift. The employee accepted a voluntary lay-off because she had no one to stay with her three small children during the morning shift hours. The employee claimed that she was compelled to cease work, not because of her changed circumstances, but because of the inability of the employer to provide continued employment on the same terms as before. The court affirmed the order of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review denying the employee's unemployment claim and concluded that the employment relationship was severed by the employee and not by her employer, and her reason for the severance could not be considered a good cause under the express language of the Unemployment Compensation Law. The court ruled that the Law did not violate public policy and held that it was not the legislature's intention to permit an employee to insist upon working a particular shift because of domestic circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the commission used methods reasonably calculated to produce accurate findings. The commission did not err in refusing to take into account future predictions of increased numbers of telephone subscribers. If future predictions of increased subscribers were considered, then the commission would have had to make corresponding adjustments for estimated future expenses involved in handling the increased subscribers. The commission's methods, based on actual experience and geared to the known costs and income, were not in error.

Plaintiff brought an action of trespass and the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff for the amount of the funeral expenses incurred plus $ 1,000. The trial court granted plaintiff a new trial on the ground of inadequacy of the verdict and the court affirmed. It found that the granting of a new trial for inadequacy of the verdict was a matter for the sound discretion of the trial court and, in the absence of a gross abuse of such discretion, the court would not reverse. Consequently, the question before the court was not whether in its opinion the verdict of the jury was inadequate, but solely whether the trial court committed a gross abuse of discretion in granting a new trial because in its opinion it was inadequate. In this case, considering the decedent's hourly wage and his life expectancy, the court could not find that there was a gross abuse of discretion by the trial court in granting a new trial on the ground of inadequacy of the verdict.</SPAN></P>

L. 972 (Pennsylvania), which reduced the time for appeals from the courts of quarter sessions from three months to 45 days, was unconstitutional because the subject of the amending bill was not clearly expressed in its title, as required by Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The title of the 1927 act stated that it regulated the practice, bail, costs, and fees on appeals to the supreme court and superior court, and fixed the time within which appeals might be allowed and heard. In quashing the appeal, the court held that anyone seeking to determine the time within which an appeal could be taken to the superior court would be expected to examine the body of an act where the title stated that it fixed the time within which appeals might be allowed. The title's reference to &quot;fixing,&quot; rather than reducing, the time for appeals was not misleading as fixing could mean reducing, changing, or extending.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants, consumers of electric power, sought relief from an electric power utility's tariff supplements. The consumers and the utility appealed from an order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, which found that the utility's fuel adjustment clause was unreasonable, which directed filing of tariff supplement containing a modification, which found that refunds were due to certain consumers, and which denied a motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility filed tariff supplements providing for application of the fuel adjustment clause. After complaints were filed, the Commission ordered refunds to certain consumers because the clause was being applied without regard to the source of the energy supplied to consumers and because it did not adequately provide for improving efficiency. In affirming the order, the court reasoned that the Commission had the power to order refunds and that it properly designated the refund period pursuant to &sect; 313(a) of the Public Utility Law of 1937, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 66, &sect; 1153. The purpose of the clause was to stabilize, not augment, the allowable return of the utility from its basic rates. The clause permitted the utility to recover more than the bare cost of fuel and was applied to consumers of energy that was not produced using fuel. The refund order was proper and lawful. Another order of the Commission regarding payment by industrial consumers was made in a separate and distinct proceeding and did not concern refunds ordered over a prior period in a prior proceeding. Refunds were not mandatory but discretionary with the Commission.</SPAN></P>

A year later, he was re-paroled, and was almost immediately recommitted. The inmate was soon transferred from the industrial school to the penitentiary. He was paroled a year and a half later, and recommitted within three years. Six months later, the inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Affirming without agreeing with the trial court's reasoning, the court found that the inmate was lawfully confined and that a hearing was unnecessary because only questions of law were presented. Section 485 did not violate due process or equal protection because the statute did not extend the inmate's sentence beyond the maximum allowed for burglary and did not exclude him from the benefit of parole. Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.31 (1943), which allowed parole, applied to the inmate because an industrial school was a penal institution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an employer, its insurer, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed a Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Board's decision that appellee claimant was totally disabled as a result of beryllium poisoning and was entitled to compensation under the Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act of June 21, 1939.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering the matter, the court noted that neither the occupational disease legislation of July 2, 1937, P. L. 2714 (Pennsylvania), nor the Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 566, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 1201 et seq., nor the 1945 amendments to the Occupational Disease Act, included beryllium poisoning as a compensable occupational disease. The court determined that beryllium poisoning was first introduced into legislation in 1949; the claimant, however, worked for the employer from 1946 to 1947. Accordingly, because that disease was not covered or recognized by law as a compensable occupational disease while the claimant worked for the employer, the court ruled that she was not entitled to compensation. The court reasoned that when an employer and employee accepted the occupational disease legislation, their relation became contractual and the laws became part of the terms of employment. In addition, the court ruled that applying the Act of May 14, 1949, P. L. 1379, &sect; 1, which was effective July 1, 1949, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 1208, and which introduced the disease, would have impaired the parties' vested contractual rights.</SPAN></P>

The petition for appeal set forth that it was taken under the Pennsylvania Act of May 2, 1929, P. L. 1278, art. XII, &sect; 1035, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 1035.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The auditors filed a motion to quash and dismiss the appeal because, inter alia, no recognizance with two sufficient sureties, as required by the Act of 1929, had been filed. The court below granted the motion to quash the appeal, as it appeared from the record and was admitted by the taxpayers that there had not been a compliance with the Act of 1929. On appeal, the court held that the proceedings in the court below were fatally defective in that the taxpayers in their appeal from the auditors' report failed to file a recognizance in the manner and form prescribed by the Act of 1929. The court noted that the taxpayers asserted that the county commissioners would be allowed to retain payments which were illegal if the court below was sustained in quashing the appeal from the auditors' report. The court stated, in reply, that payments made out of public funds by public officials to themselves as compensation or expenses, under an authorizing statute which was subsequently declared unconstitutional or inapplicable or void, could, because of public policy, be recovered by the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant violated the provisions of the Act, which required him to have had real estate bail justified under oath, to have secured a controller's certificate, to have inquired into the sufficiency of offered bail, and to have compelled production of the muniments of title before he released persons on bail. The court rejected defendant's argument that the Act was unconstitutional. The Act did not interfere with, restrain, coerce, or diminish the judicial power. It was a valid exercise of police power by the legislature, which was intended to correct evils that existed in the magistrate courts. However, defendant's convictions under the common law counts of malfeasance and misconduct were reversed because public officials could not be convicted of such offenses where a statute provided a specific penalty for such violations. The Act provided that the magistrate was to have been removed from office, and it was not necessary to have resorted to impeachment or other processes set forth in the Pennsylvania Constitution. The trial court's charges were correct, and evidence of good character was properly rejected as it related to violations of the Act because no mens rea was involved.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance exempted certain groups and had a severability clause. The amusement vendors operated commercial enterprises that charged admissions and were not part of the exempt group. The lower court concluded that the exemption clause was discriminatory, based on improper classification, and not within the exemption to charities under Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, but held that, under the severability clause, the act had to be read without the provision, and the nontaxables then became part of the taxable class. The lower court maintained that the exempted organizations would be included if necessary to sustain the ordinance's validity, so it was valid as to the amusement vendors. On review, the court declined to decide the ordinance's constitutionality because the exemption clause had already been assumed invalid. The court concluded that the severability clause, in effect, struck down the exempting provision, made the nontaxables part of the taxable class, and rendered the ordinance valid and enforceable as to the amusement vendors.</SPAN></P>

Because the Parole Board's power was exclusive, no act or statement by the authorities of the industrial school or the trial judge could change or terminate the general sentence for burglary that automatically subjected him to confinement at the school for a term of 20 years, the maximum punishment that could be imposed for the crime pursuant to Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The following is the opinion of Judge Milner in the court below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is before us for consideration a rule granted upon the district attorney to show cause why a recognizance demanded of the petitioner should not be quashed and discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is stated in the amended petition that Edward J. Franklin, the petitioner, was indicted for assault and battery and for unlawfully resisting arrest, as of December Term, 1950, No. 347, in the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace for Philadelphia County.  The matter came on for trial before a judge and jury and the petitioner was found </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guilty.  The trial judge, nevertheless, thereupon ordered that the defendant be 'held in $ 1,000.00 bail to keep the peace for a period of two (2) years.  Defendant permitted to sign own bond,' and the order was duly endorsed upon the bill of indictment upon which petitioner had been acquitted.  The petitioner that day entered bail so that he would be committed for failure to enter such bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amended petition sets forth, and the district attorney has not controverted, that 'neither the commonwealth nor others had produced evidence upon which there could be found that the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had a previous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  criminal record or had been previously indicted for offenses other than those on which he had been that day acquitted, or that the defendant had the reputation of being a dangerous character in any respect, or that petitioner was 'not of good fame'.' We have examined the record of the trial of defendant Franklin and can find no evidence that he had a reputation of being a dangerous character in any respect or that he was not of good fame.  The petitioner contends that the trial judge did not have the power or authority to order him held in such bail; that the 'order was without factual or legal justification'; and that the order is in contravention of petitioner's rights under the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution of the United States and of Article I, Sections 9, 10 and 13, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, P.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because we are aware that many judges in this state have exercised a similar power to that which we are now called upon to subject to inquiry, and because we regard the matter as involving fundamental civil rights, we shall undertake an extended review of the authority upon which the power to bind after acquittal is alleged to rest.  Preliminarily&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  we must limit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  our inquiry by noting that we are not here concerned with the admitted common-law power of a judge to impose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">as part of a sentence, after conviction</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a requirement that a defendant enter security for his good behavior.  Nor are we considering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">the statutory peace bond</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which may be required of a defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">upon complaint of a third person</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that such defendant has threatened the person or property of the complainant: see Act of March 31, 1860, P.L. 427, section 6, 19 P.S. &sect; 23, and see also Acts of March 18, 1909, P.L. 42, 19 P.S. &sect;&sect; 24-26, April 27, 1909, P.S. 260, 19 P.S. &sect;&sect; 27-28, and see 1 Edw. III, Stat. 2, c. 16 (1327).  We are here concerned only with the assertion that a trial judge, following a trial resulting in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">acquittal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the accused, may require such defendant to post such security, to assure his good behavior, as the trial judge shall, in his discretion, direct and for such period of time as such judge may in his discretion direct. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1.&nbsp;  See the excellent note in 88 U. of Pa.L.Rev. 331 (1940) for a careful review of the practice of requiring bonds in the United States and note the careful distinction maintained throughout between surety to keep the peace and demand of a bond for good behavior; the distinction is also maintained for bonds demanded after conviction and those demanded after acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In undertaking this inquiry into the legality of the asserted authority we are aware of the fact that our Supreme Court over a century ago would seem to have already passed upon and confirmed the existence of such power.  In such circumstance there would ordinarily remain nothing further for consideration by a lower court but compliance with the law as pronounced by the highest tribunal of this Commonwealth.  But, as we shall hereinafter indicate at greater length, none of the judicial authorities relied upon is of even comparatively recent date and there are raised in this proceeding, for the first time </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> constitutional questions of grave import.  In the circumstances, we are bound to consider the impact of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution upon the statutes of this Commonwealth.  We have been unable to find any binding authority in this Commonwealth, or, indeed, in any of our sister states, which considered the validity of the ancient English statute of 34 Edw. III, c. 1, in the light of modern constitutional concepts.  In Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 1912, 223 U.S. 59, 64, 32 S.Ct. 192, 193, 56 L.Ed. 350, Mr. Justice&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Holmes stated, 'Laws frequently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are enforced which the court recognizes as possibly or probably invalid if attacked by a different interest or in a different way.'<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2.&nbsp;  In United States ex rel. Henson v. Mills, E.D.Pa.1937, 21 F.Supp. 616, reported also in 31 Pa.Dist. &amp; Co. 47, 48, a habeas corpus proceeding, Judge Maris reviewed an order, after acquittal, directing entry of bail in the sum of $ 25,000. to keep the peace and be of good behavior for a period of ten years.  The question of due process was not thoroughly considered and was not argued.  There was dicta (based on an assumption of propriety) which we may ignore.  See also the dicta in Commonwealth v. Andrews, 1905, 211 in Commonwealth v. Andrews, 1905, 211 Pa. 110, 112-113, 60 A. 554.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From our survey we have been unable to find any other state in our Union in which it is maintained that a defendant acquitted in a criminal trial can be held under bond to keep the peace.  Yet the practice has persisted for many years in Philadelphia County.  The Public Defender, in his excellent brief as amicus curiae, states that the Report of the Board of Inspectors of the Philadelphia&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County Prison for the years 1939 to 1949 indicates that in that period 478 men, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after acquittal of criminal charges, were compelled to serve an aggregate of over 600 years in the Philadelphia County Prison in default of bonds aggregating $ 613,200.  Hundreds of defendants, acquitted by juries of their peers, have been placed under the restriction of a bond to keep the peace and many who have been unable to furnish bond or have failed to enter their recognizance have languished in jail and some are now in jail as a result of this practice.  The authority for this practice is said to lie in an old English Statute adopted six centuries ago.  In the first place we believe, from our review of the history of the Statute of 34 Edward III, that neither it nor the cases relating to it, including the Bamber case [Bamber v. Com.] 10 Pa. 339, decided by our Supreme Court over a century ago, justify the practice, and that in any event, since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in 1868, and the adoption of the present Constitution of Pennsylvania in 1873, the practice is contrary to our fundamental law, is against common sense&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and an enlightened sense of justice, and is indefensible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  declares that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.  This amendment is a limitation on the powers of the states.  12 Am.Jur., Const.Law, Sect. 567, p. 258.  In the chapter on Constitutional Law in American Jurisprudence in Section 573, it is stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The essential elements of due process of law are notice and an opportunity to be heard and to defend in an orderly proceeding adapted to the nature of the case before a tribunal having jurisdiction of the cause.  One of the most famous and perhaps the most often quoted definition of due process of law is that of Daniel Webster in his argument in the Dartmouth College Case, [Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward] 4 Wheat 518, 4 L.Ed. 629, in which he declared that by due process of law is meant 'a law which hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial.' Somewhat similar is the statement that it is as old as the law that no one shall be personally bound until he has had his day in court, by which is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meant until he has been duly cited to appear and has been afforded an opportunity to be heard.  Judgment without such citation and opportunity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lacks all the attributes of a judicial determination; it is judicial usurpation and oppression and can never be upheld where justice is fairly administered.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article I, Sec. 9 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to meet the witnesses face to face, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and, in prosecution by indictment or information, a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the vicinage; he cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor can he be deprived of his life, liberty or property, unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case before us the petitioner was held under bond to keep the peace without any information or complaint lodged against him charging him with any offense mentioned in the Statute of 34 Edward III, which is set forth later on in this opinion.  He was indicted for assault and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  battery and found not guilty.  He had no notice that he might be accused of being a person 'not of good fame,' or of any other charge which could result&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the restraint of his liberty or freedom.  Without a trial by a jury of his peers he found himself adjudged quilty by a judge upon a suspicion of what he might do, and was placed under bond.  This restriction was a punishment and deprivation of his rights without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument has been made here that the practice which we condemn existed at common law in England and in the early days of this Commonwealth.  We have said that we do not concede there is good authority for the practice in the early common law, but in any event this argument is answered in American Jurisprudence, Constitutional Law, at Section 580, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The fact that one of the tests of due process is the common law as it existed at the time of the establishment of our civil and political institutions does not prevent a change in the law as it then existed.  There is no constitutional right to have all general propositions of law once adopted remain unchanged.  It is not to be inferred that all modes of procedure which do not have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the sanction of this early law are to be condemned.  Nor can it be said that every form of procedure settled in English law at the time of the emigration to America&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and brought to this country and practiced by the early colonists is an essential element of due process of law.  It has been pertinently remarked that if this were so, the procedure of the first half of the seventeenth century would be fastened upon American jurisprudence like a strait jacket, only to be unloosened by constitutional amendment, and that it would be to deny every quality of the law but its age and to render it incapable of progress or improvement.  The guaranty of due process demands only that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and that the means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained.' (The excerpts from American Jurisprudence are fortified by a host of decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the appellate courts of this and other states, referred to in the notes to the above mentioned sections.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have concluded that there is no valid authority under the law as it exists today to place the petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under bond.  He was acquitted of the charge lodged against him and he is entitled to his complete freedom, unfettered by any bond or restriction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the importance of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this and the fact that the practice we condemn has apparently been accepted and followed without adequate examination into its legitimacy, we are obliged to re-examine the subject at some length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first reported Pennsylvania case which we have found which approved the requirement that defendants post bond after and despite their acquittal, was Respublica v. Donagan, 1799, 2 Yeates 437. In that case Patrick Donagan and Francis Cox, the defendants, were charged as accessories before the fact to murder and were found not guilty.  The court ordered each to 'give security to keep the peace, and be of good behavior to all the liege citizens of the United States, and in particular to Peter Shitz, for the term of fourteen years, each in the sum of 10,000 dollars and two good sureties in 10,000 dollars each.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report states that 'there was strong reason to believe that the prisoners had been concerned in a most horrid murder, though there was not sufficient evidence to convict them of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  crime.  The court directed them to give the above security, under the firm opinion that they were persons of most dangerous character, and not being able to give the security, they had remained in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gaol.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a motion for their enlargement it was contended that the orders operated as life sentences; that the constitution forbade requirement of excessive bail, imposition of excessive fines or imposition of cruel punishments.  The motion was denied per curiam on the statement that 'The court before whom the trial was had, under their general authority to preserve the peace, had a right to require such bail and for such a length of time, as they judged would best answer the ends of public justice.  No doubt can be entertained of it.  And it would be highly improper for us to interfere, in a matter wherein they have exercised their legal discretion.  Unsafe would the community be, if such characters could prowl at large through the country, without a sufficient tie on them.' By footnote, reference was made, not by the court, but by the editor, to the following English authorities, viz.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Surety for the good behavior ordered by the Court after acquittal.  Comb. 40, 2 Hawk. 442. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One may be bound with sureties for his good behaviour even during life.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3.&nbsp;  This reference to Sergeant Hawkins we shall consider infra. The reference to 'Comb. 40' is to Rex v. Sir John Knight and is also discussed infra.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Surety of the peace may be demanded for any number of years that the public safety requires.  It is discretionary in the court.  1 Term, Rep. 700'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A note following the opinion states, 'The prisoner afterwards broke gaol and escaped.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently the next case to arise in this Commonwealth was Respublica v. Cobbet, 1800, 3 Yeates 91, where the defendant caused publication of certain allegedly slanderous words as to the governments and officers of the United States and this Commonwealth.  A recognizance in stated amounts was taken by Thomas McKean, the then chief justice 'conditioned that if the above bounden William Cobbett, shall be of good behavior towards the aforesaid Commonwealth, and all the liege people until the next Court * * * then the said recognizance to be void, otherwise to remain in force.' The proceeding was in debt on forfeited recognizance for good&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  behavior.  Although there was reference to the statute of 34 Edw. III, c. 1 and the right to require surety prior to conviction there is nothing to indicate that such binding to good behavior followed an acquittal.  It would seem that the action must have originated on complaint of some third person, a procedure not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  here challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and perhaps most important Pennsylvania case was Bamber v. Commonwealth, 1849, 10 Pa. 339, in which two defendants were indicted for burglaries acquitted in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia.  The following order was then recorded, 'And now, &amp;c., from the evidence presented to the court in the trial of this cause, the court order that the defendants, &amp;c., give bail in the sum of $ 5,000. to keep the peace and be of good behaviour to all good citizens of this Commonwealth for the term of one year each; and that they stand committed until this order is complied with.' The judgment was affirmed per curiam </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">without opinion</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the reported proceeding indicates that both Coulter, J. and Rogers, J. relied on the vague assumption that such power was said to have thitherto been undoubted.  Counsel for the appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  argued as follows, 'The order is, to find surety of the peace and for good behaviour.  The former is under the Act of 1700, and can only be on the oath of one that he goeth in bodily fear of another.  The latter is founded on 34 Ed. 3, c. 1, and ought to be conditioned for the party's appearance to answer, otherwise what becomes of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provision in Mag.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Counsel for the Commonwealth contended that the Dongagan case in 2 Yeates 437 foreclosed the question as to discretionary power to hold to bail for good behaviour, even after acquittal and recited a practice of doing so.  Reference was made to 34 Edw. III, c. 1 for authority; that it was in force&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in this state: 3 Bin. 612; and that it gave discretionary power to a magistrate to take surety from all those whom he has just cause to suspect to be dangerous: 1 Hawk.P.C., Ch. 61, s. 4.  The following is stated in the report of argument 10 Pa. at page 340:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'These are instances (i.e. the 'just cause') where defendants acquitted against plain evidence of felonies and other enormous crimes, have been bound to their good behavior: 2 Hawk.B. 2, ch. 47, s. 11; 2 Hale P.C. 136, in note, Am.edition, 1847.  Here, the record shows the court below demanded surety on 'evidence presented' on a trial.  Even at common law, a man might be bound to good behavior if it were testified he was of ill fame, and be committed till he finds sureties: 2 Hale P.C. 394.  Surety for good behavior, even when defendant is not bound to answer, may be demanded: Com. v. Davies, 1 Bin. 98,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  note.  The cases cited on the other side are cases of 'surety of the peace,' which differs from surety for good behavior, though the latter includes the former.  1 T.R. 696, was surety of the peace proper, and the point held was, that there might be a binding over for more than a year.  12 Ad. &amp; Ellis, 599, was also surety of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  peace.  By the Act of 1700 (Purdon, 1083), previous oath in surety of peace is required; no such necessity in surety for good behavior.  In Com. v. Keeper of the Prison, 1 Ashm. 140, it was held that an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">indefinite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> binding over to keep the peace and be of good behavior, could not be enforced in a matter of private wrong.  Surety for good behavior includes surety for the peace, and something more.  4 Bl.Com. 256. A justice may bind over night-walkers, such as keep suspicious company, or are reported to be pilferers and robbers, and other persons 'whose misbehavior may reasonably bring them within the general words of the statute, as persons not of good fame; an expression, it must be owned, of so great latitude as leaves much to be determined by the discretion of the magistrate himself: 4 Bl.Com. 256, 257.  A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">fortiori</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may a judge who, by 'evidence presented,' is satisfied that a man is not of good fame, and likely to endanger the public peace, demand surety for good behavior.  Like all other discretionary powers, it should be used cautiously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is apparent that the sole authorities relied upon by our cases in the Statute of 34 Edw.

Yet the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power is traced to and said to be derived from paragraph 6 of this act which provided for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taking from 'them that be not of good fame * * * sufficient surtey and mainprise of their good behavior.' A study of the subject matter indicates that the so-called 'historical' basis for requiring the posting of a bond to keep the peace after acquittal is little more than bald assumption coupled with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">unsupported</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statements by legal writers based on cloudy old English cases whose very authority is left doubtful by subsequent English cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 4 Blackstone 256 no reference is made to the specific question of whether a defendant may be required to post a bond for good behavior after acquittal, but reference over is made to 1 Hawkins, P.C. 132-133 where such authority is assumed.  Blackstone first discusses the distinction between recognizances for the peace (what we refer to in this opinion as statutory peace bonds based on complaint and hearing) and for good behavior.  He observes that a recognizance for good behavior 'includes security for the peace and somewhat more' and proceeds as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'1.  First, then, the justices are empowered, by the statute 34 Edw. III, c. 1, to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bind over to the good behavior towards the king and his people all them </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">that be not of good fame</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, wherever&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they be found; to the intent that the people be not troubled nor endamaged, nor the peace diminished, nor merchants and others, passing by the highways of the realm, be disturbed nor put in the peril which may happen by such offenders. Under the general words of this expression, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">that be not of good fame</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it is holden that a man may be bound to his good behavior for causes of scandal, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">contra bonos mores</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as well as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">contra pacem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; as, for haunting bawdy-houses with women of bad fame, or for keeping such women in his own house, or for words tending to scandalize the government, or in abuse of the officers of justice, especially in the execution of their office.  Thus also a justice may bind over all nightwalkers; eavesdroppers; such as keep suspicious company, or are reported to be pilferers or robbers; such as sleep in the day and wake in the night; common drunkards; whoremasters; the putative fathers of bastards; cheats; idle vagabonds; and other persons whose misbehavior may reasonably bring them within the general words of the statutes as persons not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of good fame: an expression, it must be owned, of so great a latitude as to leave much to be determined by the discretion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the magistrate himself.  But if he commits a man for want of sureties, he must express the cause thereof with convenient certainty, and take care that such cause be a good one.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2 Hawkins, P.C., chap. 47, section 11, page 463 (8th Ed. 1824) Hawkins stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That it has been adjudged, that if the jury acquitted a prisoner of an indictment of felony against manifest evidence, the court may, before the verdict is recorded, but not after, order them to go out again and reconsider the matter; but this is by me thought hard, and seems not of late years to have been so frequently practiced as formerly.  Also there are instances where defendants acquitted against plain evidence, of felonies and other enormous crimes, have been bound to their good behavior.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this latter assertion, which is the point we are considering, Hawkins refers to three cases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hopestill Tyndal's Case, Cro.Car. 291, 79 Eng.Rep. 855 (1633); Evans and Cottington Case, Cro.Car. 507, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 79 Eng.Rep. 1037 (1639); and 2 St.Tr. 60. The latter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two cases we may well disregard since in both of them the power to punish was apparently based on the fact that the defendants were found guilty of contempt of court committed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  during the course of their respective trials.  In the case of Evans and Cottington nine persons were indicted for grand riot and five of them were adjudged not guilty; as to three of them there was evidence of riot committed near the court.  Hawkins indicates that the bond required was based on this contempt of court and this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that Justice Croke expressed no dissent as he did in the Hopestill Tyndal case. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And afterwards, upon evidence at the Bar, divers witnesses were produced by the defendant, which were heard without oath (1 Ann. c. 9 witnesses in behalf of a prisoner shall not be sworn.  2 Bulst. 147;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2 Hawk. c. 46, S. 29 and the cases there cited 4 Bl.Com. 353), but some of them witnessing matter which the Attorney General conceived would make for the King, whereupon the desire of the said attorney they were sworn, and after ordered upon their said oath to deliver their knowledge.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most significant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aspect of this opinion is that the statute of 34 Edward III, c. 1 is not cited as its authority; nor is there any reference to previous judicial precedents as there was on the point of taking the oath of witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rex v. Sir John Knight, Comberback 38, 39, 40, 90 Eng.Rep. 330, 331 (1687), cited in the Donagan case, the report lacks clarity and detail, but it would seem that the defendant was bound to good behavior after acquittal.  The report indicates that an information was lodged 'for going to church with pistols, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  etc. contra stat. 2 Ed. 3, * * *' and continued: 'C.

And it was ordered accordingly per Cur.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to understand several aspects of this case.  The separation of the two segments of the case is unexplained.  It is not clear whether the proceeding involves a complaint by a third party or not; the procedure by information rather than by indictment is not explained.  No report has been found of any pertinent 'Jordan's case' and we note that no reference is made to the statute of 34 Edward III, c. 1, though the prosecution was itself&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  apparently based on an earlier statute of Edward III.</SPAN></P>

It was held that the indictment should be quashed; that a man could not be indicted for speaking such words.  The court then added that 'he might have been bound to his good behavior.' In Collin's v.

The court refused to entertain debate whether the offense was punishable at common law.  The defendant was 'fined 25/ for each of his four discourses, to suffer a years imprisonment, and to enter into a recognizance for his good behavior during his life, himself in 3000/ and 2000/ by others.' There was no acquittal and the case is not pertinent to our inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Martyn Page case, the defendant was acquitted, by a jury, of rape upon a 10 year child because of lack of evidence of penetration and the judges who heard the evidence caused an indictment for battery to be preferred and found.  Defendant was 'committed to prison, there to abide during the King's Pleasure, to be fined two hundred marks, to stand upon the pillory in Chancery-lane, in Middlesex, near the place where the fact was committed, with a paper upon his head signifying the cause, and to be bound with able sureties to the good behavior during life.' This case also did not involve the posting of security </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">after acquittal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bowes case the court engaged in a lengthy discussion of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the power of the court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to require bail for longer than a year and in considerable sums but no issue of bond after acquittal was involved; the action was initiated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">on a complaint by the defendant's wife</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have him enter security, a proceeding now governed by the Acts of 1860 and 1909 in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to the foregoing, reference may be made to Rex v. Holt, 7 Car. &amp; P. 518, 524, 173 Eng.Rep. 229, 232 (1836) wherein Littledale, J., refused a request that he detain an acquitted defendant until articles of peace were prepared.  Justice Littledale stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'When a verdict of Not guilty is found, and the Grand Jury are discharged, the prisoner is entitled to be discharged immediately.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rex v. Dunn, 4 Per. &amp; Dav. 437 (1840) after the defendant was discharged on articles of peace exhibited, the Attorney General moved that the defendant be bound for good behavior, Lord Denman, a distinguished common law judge, in denying that motion, stated (page 438):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We think it must be taken that our judgment disposes of the whole matter up to the present time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On pages 434-435 Lord Denman states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The power of the justices of the peace in this behalf is traced to a statute of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Edw. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3, which was made the foundation of the commission of the peace, though some have thought that it did not warrant the crown in granting so large an authority.  We cannot question the validity of the commission, which has been in operation for centuries; but the justices of the peace on the other hand cannot give themselves jurisdiction in any case.  They cannot go beyond the terms and fair meaning of the commission.  * * * The fair meaning is, that if one person informs the court or a justice of the peace that he goes in fear and in danger of personal violence from another, by reason of threats employed by him, and prays the protection of sureties of the peace, that protection may be granted.  Unless such a case appear, no jurisdiction appears; nor can we ever infer facts necessary to give jurisdiction from the mere circumstance of an inferior court assuming to act as if they possessed it; least of all where, by the exercise of a discretionary power on an ex parte statement, which is not to be allowed to be contradicted, a single magistrate may deprive the subject of his personal freedom.  An opportunity must therefore be given for arguing the validity of the act done&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the sessions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or magistrate, and unless this may be done by means of the writ of certiorari, it could never be done at all where the gaoler makes a general return to the habeas corpus.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have made extended reference to the cases in England and in this Commonwealth to show the dubious case basis on which there has been erected the present supposition that a defendant despite acquittal by a jury of his peers may nevertheless be bound over for his good behavior and, in default of the entry of the designated security, be forthwith imprisoned until such security be entered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We turn now to a consideration of the petitioner's contention that the court's order and the statute which purportedly supplies its authority is in contravention of the petitioner's rights under the federal and the state constitutions.  We are of the firm opinion that the statute is, on its face, under the decided cases and as administered, fatally defective because of vagueness; that because of such vagueness it contravenes Article 2, Section 1 of The Constitution of Pennsylvania as an improper delegation of legislative power to the judiciary.  Further and concomitantly the guide 'not of good fame' which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is the trigger mechanism&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for invocation of the statutory power to require a bond for good behavior is defectively vague and fails to provide any reasonably accurate ascertainable standard of guilt or to give reasonable notice of the conduct it purports to proscribe, contrary to the due process clause of the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution and contrary to the requirement of due process in Article 1, sections 1 and 9 of the constitution of this Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act of 34 Edw. III, c. 1, authorizes justices of the peace </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to 'take of all them that be not of good fame * * * sufficient surety * * * of their good behavior * * * to the intent that the people be not by such rioters or rebels troubled nor endangered, nor the peace blemished nor merchants nor others passing by the Highways of the realm disturbed, nor put in the peril which may happen of such offenders.' The language of this section as well as that of the other sections quoted above is obviously addressed to a particular and peculiar situation then confronting the people of England in 1360.  If we were to regard the statute as limited to the dangers engendered by 'rioters or rebels' it is obvious&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the statute would be essentially&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inappropriate and of little consequence to the circumstances of our people.  However, the significant words which have been judicially seized upon for the exercise of power in particular cases wherein judges have felt the juries went awry, are the words 'them that be not of good fame.' Is this a standard?  We think not.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court of the United States has on frequent occasions considered the question of statutory vagueness.  In Connally v. General Construction Co., 1925, 269 U.S. 385, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322, the Supreme Court of the United States considered an Oklahoma statute,&nbsp;61 O.S.1951 &sect; 3, which imposed severe penalties upon contractors who paid their workmen less than the 'current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work is performed * * *.' Mr. Justice Sutherland speaking for the court stated in 269 U.S. at pages 391-392, 46 S.Ct. at page 127:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***35]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  part will render them liable to its penalties is a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law; and a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.  International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 216, 221, 34 S.Ct. 853, 58 L.Ed. 1284; Collins v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 634, 638, 34 S.Ct. 924, 58 L.Ed. 1510.</SPAN></P>

In some of the cases the statutes involved were upheld; in others, declared invalid.  The precise point of differentiation in some instances is not easy of statement; but it will be enough for present purposes to say generally that the decisions of the court, upholding statutes as sufficiently certain, rested upon the conclusion that they employed words or phrases having a technical or other special meaning, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  well enough known to enable those within their reach to correctly apply them, Hygrade Provision Co. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***35]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  v.

United States, 229 U.S. 373, 376, 33 S.Ct. 780, 57 L.Ed. 1232; International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, supra, [234 U.S.] at page 223, 34 S.Ct. 853, or, as broadly stated by Mr. Chief Justice White in United States v. [L.] Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.S. 81, 92, 41 S.Ct. 298, 301, 65 L.Ed. 516, 'that, for reasons found to result either from the text of the statutes involved or the subjects with which they dealt, a standard of some sort was afforded.'

Kentucky, supra, and United States v. [L.] Cohen Grocery Co., supra,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and cases there cited.  The Cohen Grocery case involved the validity of section 4 of the Food Control Act of 1917, which imposed a penalty upon any person who should make 'any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries.' It was held that these words fixed no ascertainable standard of guilt, in that they forbade no specific or definite act.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court quoted with approval in 269 U.S. at pages 392-393, 46 S.Ct. at page 128 the following from United States v. Capital Traction Co., 1910, 34 App.D.C. 592, 596, 598:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The statute makes it a criminal offense for the street railway companies in the District of Columbia to run an insufficient number of cars to accommodate persons desiring passage thereon, without crowding the same.  What shall be the guide to the court or jury in ascertaining what constitutes a crowded car?  What may be regarded as a crowded car by one jury may not be so considered by another. What shall constitute a sufficient number of cars in the opinion of one judge may be regarded as insufficient by another.  * * * There is a total absence of any definition of what shall constitute a crowded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  car.  This important element cannot be left to conjecture, or be supplied by either the court or the jury.  It is of the very essence of the law itself, and without it the statute is too indefinite and uncertain to support an information or indictment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  '* * * The dividing line between what is lawful and unlawful cannot be left to conjecture.  The citizen cannot be held to answer charges based upon penal statutes whose mandates are so uncertain that they will reasonably admit of different constructions.  A criminal statute cannot rest upon an uncertain foundation.  The crime, and the elements constituting it, must be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, in advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue.  Penal statutes prohibiting the doing of certain things, and providing a punishment for their violation, should not admit of such a double meaning that the citizen may act upon the one conception of its requirements and the courts upon another.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opinion of the court concluded 269 U.S. at page 395, 46 S.Ct. at page 129:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The result is that the application of the law depends, not upon a word of fixed meaning in itself, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***39]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or one made definite by statutory or judicial definition, or by the context or other legitimate aid to its construction, but upon the probably varying impressions of juries as to whether given areas are or are not to be included within particular localities.

The court discussed at length the word 'gang' employed in the statute and stated that it had no 'meaning derivable from the common law, for neither in that field nor anywhere in the language of the law is there definition of the word' 306 U.S. at page 455, 59 S.Ct. at page 621 and concluded 'The challenged provision condemns no act or omission; the terms it employs to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***40]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  indicate what it purports to denounce are so vague, indefinite and uncertain that it must be condemned as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.'

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In State v.

The court must use every authorized means to ascertain and give it an intelligible meaning, but if after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***40]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such effort it is found to be impossible to solve the doubt and dispel the obscurity, if no judicial certainty can be settled upon as to the meaning, the court is not at liberty to supply, to make one.  The court may not allow 'conjectural interpretation to usurp the place of judicial exposition.' There must be a competent and efficient expression of the legislative will.  In Drake v. Drake, 1833, [15 N.C. 110] Chief Justice Ruffin said, 'Whether a statute be a public or a private one, if the terms in which it is couched be so vague as to convey no definite meaning to those whose duty it is to execute it, either ministerially or judicially, it is necessarily inoperative.  The law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***42]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  must remain as it was, unless that which professes to change it be itself intelligible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Stoutenburgh v. Frazier, 1900, 16 App.D.C. 299, 48 L.R.A. 220, the court considered a statute in which the language was similar to that used in the statute of 34 Edward III, c. 1.  Congress enacted a statute relative to suspicious persons and vagrants which read in part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That all vagrants; all idle and disorderly persons; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">persons of evil life or evil fame</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * * shall, upon conviction thereof, be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***41]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fined not to exceed forty dollars, or required to enter into security for good behavior for a period of six months.' (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was arrested, tried and convicted on a charge of being a suspicious person.  The court stated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Suspicion may exist without even the knowledge of the party who is the object of the suspicion.  The suspicion may be generated in the mind of one or more persons without even colorable foundation of truth for the suspicion; yet the party, the object of the suspicion, may, under the statute * * * be seized, imprisoned, tried and convicted merely because some persons or police officer may have concluded (whether upon reasonable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***43]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grounds or not) that he was a suspicious person.  Of what suspected and what degree of suspicion exists, must always be the first thought that occurs upon such a charge as that made in this case.  But here the party is charged, in an abstract way, with being a suspicious person merely, there being no act or conduct of his, mentioned in the statute, to which the suspicion could relate.  How is he to meet such a charge?  * * * A suspicious character, however, does not constitute crime, nor does it justify the government&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***42]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in treating the party from having such reputation as criminal, without connecting him with some criminal act or conduct.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court then proceeded to rule the statute to be unconstitutional, in conflict with the federal constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures and cruel and unusual punishments and in the course of its opinion pertinently stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In the legislation of England, in regard to the police of that Kingdom, we find a great variety of regulations prescribed from time to time, dating back to the earlier reigns and all those in succession; down to modern times, to meet the requirements of the then existing state of society. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***44]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But much of that legislation has become obsolete, and, from its severe restrictions upon the liberties of the people, and the cruel and unnatural punishments inflicted, it has long since ceased to be applicable to modern society, and could not at this day be tolerated.  The history of that legislation is clearly stated by Mr. Justice Stephen in the Third Volume of his History of the Criminal Law of England, chap. 32, pp. 263-274, and in 2 Broom &amp; Hadley, Com. 467.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applying then the principles of these cases to the statute of 34 Edw.

In the Lanzetta case, supra, the Supreme Court of the United States stated 306 U.S. at page 453, 59 S.Ct. at page 619:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If on its face the challenged provision is repugnant to the due process clause, specification of details of the offense intended to be charged would not serve to validate it.  Cf.  United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 221, 23 L.Ed. 563; Czarra v. Board of Medical Supervisors, 25 App.D.C. 443, 453. It is the statute, not the accusation under it, that prescribes the rule to govern conduct and warns against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***44]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transgression.  See Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 368, 51 S.Ct. 532, 535, 75 L.Ed. 1117; Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949. No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.  All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.' [Citing, by footnote, numerous cases.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have examined every pertinent case, modern and ancient, which we could find or to which we were referred and we are unable to conclude&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***46]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the phrase 'not of good fame' has in any way been made definite by judicial construction or definition and it is certainly not made definite by context or by the evil it was designed to cure: see Connally v. General Const. Co., supra, 269 U.S. at page 395, 46 S.Ct. 126. Commonwealth v. Foster, 1905, 28 Pa.Super. 400 is the only case we have found which actually considered the purport and scope of the words 'not of good fame.' In that case the defendant had been convicted several times 'of doing worldly business on Sunday' in violation of the Act of April 22, 1794, 3 Sm.L. 177. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Upon complaint by affidavit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the court of quarter sessions required of him security&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***45]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be of good behavior.  The Superior Court reversed this order.  Mr. Justice Potter, on behalf of the court, concluded that the defendant was not the type of offender contemplated by the Act of 34 Edward III, c. 1.  There is language in this opinion which reflects the assumption that there exists a power to bind over after acquittal in a 'proper' case, but the cases and authorities relied upon are those we have already made reference to.  This case has not cured the vagueness of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***47]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute.  Perhaps the most striking aspect of the judicial history of the language in the statute 34 Edw. III, c. 1, is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in 592 years</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it has received no definition other than in a few isolated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">negative</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> instances.  The illustrations used by Blackstone, Hawkins and Burn are either obviously inappropriate or so broad as to be as meaningless as the phrase to be defined.  It is also obvious that many of these illustrations could only apply </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">after a conviction</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming, however, that the power to require bond for good behavior is somehow limited by the words 'not of good fame' as a purported reference to our criminal law or criminal prosecutions, to just what criminal acts does it have reference? &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***46]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Does it refer to previous convictions?  The suggestion that any person who has suffered a previous conviction is subject to being bound to his good behavior if he is again accused and acquitted is to suggest a second punishment for the same offense. Is the conclusion to be based upon evidence which we must assume the jury disbelieved?  If so, evidence of what?  Mr. Justice Potter in the Foster case stated, 'This record contains nothing from which it could be inferred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***48]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that there was any reasonable ground to apprehend or that this justice of the peace apprehended, that this defendant would commit any felony or misdemeanor or disturb the peace, or in any way trouble, disturb or injure any of the people of the state, in their persons or property.' Honest observation of the practice in, at least, the courts of this county would compel admission that few records reflect the matters referred to by Judge Potter.  The real function of the practice is to substitute a judicial finding of guilty for the jury's acquittal; it is punishment for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">past</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> iniquity; especially is this so where the bond is fixed so high that the defendant (recently freed by the verdict) is committed for default. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***47]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It substitutes suspicion of what a man may do for proof of violation of the criminal laws. This without a trial of the suspicion before a jury.  Surely this is not due process of law.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">13.&nbsp;  In the Pennsylvania Report of Legislative Commission to Investigate Administration of Criminal Justice (July, 1938), it was stated, 'A practice has grown up among certain judges in Philadelphia of holding in 'Bonds to keep the Peace' defendants who have been acquitted by juries, and in some cases, persons who have not been charged with any criminal offense.  The bonds are often fixed at an exorbitant sum which such persons cannot procure and the effect is to keep men in prison for long periods of time until the judge decides to release them.' The commission also stated, '* * * it is the conclusion of many eminent jurists, lawyers and scholars, that such procedure is clearly unconstitutional and a flagrant and dangerous abuse of judicial power.' It is clear, however, that the Commission did not rely upon any judicial authorities for its assertion and we are now to determine whether that expressed opinion was correct.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***49]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Closely related to the problem of vagueness as an infringement on due process&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***48]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is the problem of the delegation of legislative power to the judiciary.  It is particularly pertinent in the matter we are considering because the legislation purports to vest power in the hands of the judiciary as an aspect of their ancient role of conservators of the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Article II, section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution all legislative power is vested exclusively in the General Assembly.  In Kellerman v. Philadelphia, 1939, 139 Pa.Super. 569, 575, 13 A.2d 84, 86, the principle was enunciated that 'any legislative enactment which vests in a person or body of persons free of any standard independent of his or their own mind and judgment the power of supplying, or giving force to, or suspending its terms * * *' is unconstitutional.  See O'Neil v. American Fire Ins. Co., 1895, 166 Pa. 72, 30 A. 943, 26 L.R.A. 715; Bell Telephone Co. of Penn. v. Driscoll, 1941, 343 Pa. 109, 21 A.2d 912; Holgate Bros. Co. v.

Philadelphia School Dist., 1937, 328 Pa. 225, 195 A. 90, 113 A.L.R. 1401. This rule applies as well to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***49]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prohibit the vesting of legislative power in the judiciary: see State ex rel. Patterson v. Bates, 1905, 96 Minn. 110, 104 N.W. 709; Burnett v. Greene, 1929, 97 Fla. 1007, 122 So. 570, 69 A.L.R. 244; In re Opinion of Justices, 1932, 279 Mass. 607, 180 N.E. 725, 81 A.L.R. 1059; Searle v.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undoubtedly the principle of the separation of powers in the three departments of government applies with least force and effect to the judiciary insofar as the entire concept of judicial discretion has been evolved.  But it has never been supposed that a legislature may under the guise of reliance upon discretion abdicate its power and transfer it to the judiciary.  When courts are said to exercise discretion the reference is to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">legal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discretion </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">within not without the bounds of the law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The rule was most aptly phrased by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of U. S., 1824, 9 Wheat. 738, 866, 6 L.Ed. 204:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Judicial power, as contradistinguished&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***51]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the power of the laws, has no existence.  Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing.  When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***50]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law, and when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge; always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the Legislature; or in other words, to the will of the law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.' (emphasis added).  See Maloney v. Stahlnecker, 1941, 341 Pa. 517, 522, 19 A.2d 162; Dauphin County Grand Jury Investigative Proceedings No. 3, 1938, 332 Pa. 358, 364, 2 A.2d 809; Schlaudecker v. Marshall, 1872, 72 Pa. 200, 206; Melnick v. Melnick, 1942, 147 Pa.Super. 564, 570, 25 A.2d 111.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purport of the foregoing cases and principles must be that the legislature has no right to confer or the judiciary to accept a power in terms so broad and meaning so vague that the application or non-application of the law depends wholly upon the individual opinion and predilections of the trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***52]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judge.  Any statute which makes the judge's discretion the only rule for his conduct must be regarded as invalid: see King v. State, 1889, 87 Tenn. 304, 10 S.W. 509, 3 L.R.A. 210.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What guide is there in the language of 34 Edw. III whereby the exercise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***51]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of judicial discretion is to be tested.  We have already set forth the aspects of vagueness in the statute whereby it fails to meet the minimum requirements of due process and we need not repeat ourselves.  It is sufficient to note that nowhere is there an intelligible standard whereby a judge may consider the propriety of exercising his discretion in regard to whatever facts may appear; the words 'not of good fame' receive no clarification in the early English cases prior to the formation of this Commonwealth nor in the works of ancient and respected textwriters.  The words 'not of good fame' do not have any settled reference to any defined act or series of acts; there need not be proved any criminal intent or purpose; there is no hearing on the issue of 'good fame' nor is there any necessity to indicate the facts found or the reasons for the judge's conclusion.  Indeed, what we do find in the old cases is a singular&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***53]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  awareness of the danger in the virtually untrammeled power apparently claimed.  See the quotation from Blackstone, supra, 5 Burn's Just. 746.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Commonwealth v. Davies, 1804, 1 Bin. 97 there appears in a footnote the opinion of Chief Justice Tilghman in the case of Commonwealth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***52]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  v. Duane, decided on August 11, 1806.  In that case, upon complaint of certain parties through the attorney general as to the publication of past libels, the Mayor of Philadelphia directed Duane to enter into a recognizance for appearance at the next Mayor's court and enter security for good behavior until his appearance at such court.  Apparently he was committed upon failure to post security for good behavior.  In a habeas corpus proceeding it was held that he need only post security for appearance at court and not for good behavior.  Chief Justice Tilghman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discussed the matter at length and stated 1 Bin. at pages 98, 99:<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">14.&nbsp;  When it is considered that Justice Tilghman was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when the Report of the Judges was made as to English Statutes in force in this commonwealth his expressed view that surety for good behavior could be demanded either after conviction as part of the judgment of the court or '</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">before the trial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">' of a 'person charged with an offense' is entitled to careful consideration in determining the extent of the authority conferred by 34 Edward III., c. 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***54]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Surety for good behavior may be considered in two points of view.  It&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***53]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is either required after conviction of some indictable offence, in which case it forms part of the judgment of the court, and is founded on a power incident to courts of record by the common law, or it is demanded by judges or justices of the peace out of court, before the trial of the person charged with an offence, in pursuance of authority derived from a statute made in the 34th year of Edward 3.  It is this last kind of surety we are now to consider.  The statute 34 Edward 3, authorizes justices of the peace to take surety for good behavior of all those that are not of good fame, to the intent that the public may not be troubled by such persons.  It is supposed that this statute was made to prevent the disorders which were introduced by the soldiers of Edward the third, numbers of whom, after serving in his armies in France, were discharged in England.  The natural meaning of the words 'persons not of good fame' seems to be, those who by their general evil course and habits of life had acquired a bad reputation, and were supposed to be dangerous to the community. In process of time, however, the construction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***55]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of these expressions has been extended far beyond their original meaning, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***54]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and persons are now commonly held to find surety for their good behavior, who are not generally of ill fame, but have only been charged with some particular offence.  It is laid down by some ancient authors, that libellers may be held to surety for good behavior.  * * *'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There then followed a discussion of surety for good behavior to prevent libel and of the contention that it was a thing 'of course.' The Chief Justice continued 1 Bin. at page 99:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'* * * Now if this practice is established, two consequences will follow, which certainly may be attended with great inconvenience. In the first place the Justice who takes the recognizance may fix it in whatever sum he pleases, and then if it should be forfeited by a libel of the mildest nature, the whole penalty must be recovered, without any power in the court to mitigate the punishment according to the nature of the offence.  And in the second place, the defendant may be brought to trial for a libel, so far as to be burthened with the forfeiture of his recognizance, without the previous investigation of a grand jury.  No considerate man&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***56]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will say that under certain circumstances these may not be very great evils. No man can exactly calculate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***55]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  how far a practice of this kind, exercised by wicked and daring hands, into which it may sometimes fall, may stifle or even extinguish the spirit of honest investigation and necessary inquiry.  And what is the occasion for it?  The party complaining has a right to the protection of the laws and will receive it.  The person accused will be brought to his trial, and if convicted he will be punished accordingly to the degree of the offence.  What more does public justice require?  But it is said, it is necessary to prevent future libels.  If future libels are published while the prosecution is depending, they will be punished on conviction in proportion to the obstinacy of the offender.  No man abhors more than I do the base practice of libelling.  It is a crime forbidden by the laws of God and man, and of a much blacker dye than many men seem to be aware of.  All classes and descriptions of men, all parties have in their turn lamented and suffered by the uncontrolled licentiousness of the press.  I am not without hopes that the evil will be lessened, that a remedy will&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***57]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be found in the honesty and good sense of a majority of the people, aided by the wholesome chastisement which courts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***56]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and injuries will be called on from time to time to inflict.  But in order to give those punishments their full efficacy in the community, it will be necessary to judicial proceedings to temper firmness with liberality, never forgetting that humane principle, which in doubtful cases turns the scale in favor of the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'* * * In the present case, Duane is charged with publishing two libels against the same person, and he has not confessed that he is the author of either.  As a judge, I know nothing that is not legally proved before me.  I must not act on the supposition that the defendant has published numerous libels, because there is no oath to that purpose, and by our constitution all warrants must be ground upon an oath or affirmation.  Upon the whole, the most that can be said with regard to recognizances for good behavior is, that they are demandable or not, at the discretion of the judge.  They differ from recognizances to keep the peace, in two important features: 1. Surety for good behavior is more extensive in its nature than surety for the peace, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***58]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and may be more easily forfeited, and therefore should be exacted with greater caution.  2.  Surety of the peace is demandable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***57]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of right by any individual who thinks himself in danger of bodily hurt, and will make the necessary oaths; but this principle has not been applied to surety for good behavior.  I will not say that there are no circumstances in which surety for good behavior ought not to be exacted in cases of libels before conviction; on the contrary, I have no doubt but there are occasions on which it may be proper and necessary to insist on it.  But I am of opinion that it will be most agreeable to the spirit of our constitution, and most conducive to the suppression of libels, to adopt it as a rule, not to demand surety for good behavior before conviction.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Commonwealth v. Keeper of the Prison, (1828?), 1 Ashm. 140, a habeas corpus proceeding, the relators had been 'required to give bail for future good conduct and behavior towards 'a named individual' as well as to all the good citizens of the commonwealth'; upon refusal to enter bail they were committed until the 'next Mayor's Court.' The court in its opinion discussed the facts at length indicating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***59]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that there was an issue as to whether defendants had committed a forcible entry.  The question was as to the propriety of obtaining surety of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***58]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the peace against future repetition; the relator had never been tried.  President Judge King stated in 1 Ashm. at page 148 that guilt should be 'as clear as the sun in the firmament' to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'authorize a judge to usurp the functions of a court and jury, and to decide, first that a crime accompanied with a breach of peace has been committed, and that the party charged should be coerced under pain of imprisonment to give surety against its future repetition.  * * * The relators before I should demand surety of the peace from them on the assumption that they are forcible enterers and rioters, have the legal and constitutional right of having that vital question determined by a jury of their peers.  The argument that a demand of surety of the peace is a more mild and merciful proceeding than a prosecution by indictment, is more specious than solid.  In effect it gives to a single magistrate, a power which pertains only to a court and jury, and in substance deprives the accused of what is his most inestimable right, the trial by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***60]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury.  I would ask the advocates of this doctrine what is to limit the magistrate or subsequently the court to which suretyships are returnable, either as to the length&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***59]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of time for which they shall be continued, or the amount of bail by which they shall be rendered effectual.  Moderate bail and the party's recognizance is only demanded in this instance by a mild and humane magistrate, but under less auspicious circumstances a different requisition might be made, and the citizen deprived of his liberty without 'the judgment of his peers,' or as I believe 'the law of the land.' This doctrine is not novel.  'Surety of the peace,' says Dalton, page 266, 'ought not to be granted on account of a past beating, unless there be fear of future danger: the remedy in such case being by action or indictment.' How much stronger is this case where the evidence renders it doubtful whether a public offence, a private injury, or any wrong has been done, from that put by this ancient author, where the act is necessarily criminal, and the threat to repeat it, a threat to commit a certain crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Mayor's Court of the city is now in session and the grand jury not discharged.  If it is desired&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***61]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to have a judicial decision on the character of this entry, let a bill of indictment be submitted to that body.  By certiorari such a bill would be removed to the Supreme Court, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***60]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the judgment of that dignified tribunal between these parties ascertained.  If Jeremiah Willetts feels himself personally aggrieved by Edmund Shotwell, the Courts of the Commonwealth are open to him.  But until the guilt of these defendants of the crimes imputed to them is duly substantiated, I cannot under the circumstances of this case, demand of them a surety which can never be justly called for on the mere assumption of their guilt.  On the whole I am compelled to differ from what I have no doubt was the sincere and conscientious judgment of the Mayor, and accordingly refuse to call on the relators to give surety to keep the peace.  No other requisition being made of me, they are discharged and at liberty to go where they please.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do we find that there is no limitation set forth as to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">when</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the trial judge shall exercise his 'discretion' requiring bond for good behavior, but as pointed out in the three preceding cases there is no limitation as to the period of time during which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***62]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bond shall be required or as to the amount of the bond to be required.  The prohibition against unrestrained power to define the substance of penal conditions is also a prohibition against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***61]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unrestrained power to determine the sanctions which are to be applied.  In South Bethlehem v. Hackett, 1895, 4 North. Co. 381, 12 Lanc.L.R. 196, it was held that a statute which made failure to pay a certain license tax a crime punishable by a fine of not less than $ 100 was invalid as an improper delegation of legislative power because it did not fix a limit to the amount of the fines which could be imposed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>15</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

We choose, however, to conclude that civil rights are not lost by historical default; that error compounded by error remains nonetheless error.  Age alone certainly does not render a statute invalid; nor does the fact that it was adopted in and for different times and purposes.  Conversely, however, age alone cannot insulate a statute from attack when in different time and social context and in different constitutional milieu it is in irreconcilable conflict with concepts of individual rights and criminal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for the petitioner in his excellent brief has indicated at length the vast and significant differences in the world of 1360 and the world of 1952.  We shall not undertake any extended historical review of those differences.  Suffice it to note that that statute fell into a period of disorganization, riot, illness and death.  In Commonwealth v.

The condition of Europe and England is set forth in Volume IV (Vol. 1 of the series, The State of Europe during the Middle Ages) of the monumental work of Henry Hallam (10th ed., Little Brown &amp; Company, Boston 1853) in chapter I, part II.  For one hundred and twenty years war between France and England raged in greater magnitude than any since the fall of the Roman Empire, interrupted once by a truce in 1357 by the Peace of Bretigni.  During the same period pestilence laid waste the peoples of Europe and England and Hallam indicates what must have 'returned home' to England in a passage as follows (pages 56-57):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is no affliction which did not fall upon France during this miserable period.  A foreign enemy was in the heart of the kingdom, the king was a prisoner, the capital in sedition, * * * Famine, the sure and terrible companion of war, for several years desolated the country.  In 1348, a pestilence, the most extensive and unsparing of which we have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***65]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any memorial, visited France&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***64]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as well as the rest of Europe, and consummated the work of hunger and the sword.  The companies of adventure, mercenary troops in the service of John or Edward, finding no immediate occupation after the truce of 1357, scattered themselves over the country, in search of pillage.  No force existed sufficiently powerful to check these robbers in their career.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In final analysis the power which the judiciary has arrogated unto it itself is a crystalization of a judicial attitude that the jury is not to be fully and finally trusted with its function.  The power to bind to good behavior after acquittal is and has been used when the trial judge is of the opinion that the jury erred in its verdict.  Without discussing the nature, history and function of the jury, in an already over-extended opinion, it should be sufficient to observe that the jury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***66]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is more than just a juridical instrument, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***65]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it is a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">political</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> institution which should not be hastily infringed upon in particular and difficult cases lest the generality of freedom which it purports to represent be undermined without planned substitute.  To the jury belongs the power to err, not alone in gullibility but also deliberately.  A most important portion of the administration of our system of criminal justice is the fact that the jury in subtle ways may temper the rigidity of our criminal code in the application of the letter of the law to particular cases and may perhaps thereby mitigate the rigors of the law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>16</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">16.&nbsp;  Consider, for example, the manner in which eighteenth century juries informally amended the broad scope of the law's definition of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">capital</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> offenses by simply refusing to return guilty verdicts in cases in which such penalty offended the conscience of the people. Also, recall the early trials of Peter Zenger and William Penn.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally we may state of record that the essentially real basis for our decision is simply that we consider the practice under review to be wrong.  We are of the firm conviction that the practice is fundamentally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***67]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in conflict with any modern and enlightened view of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***66]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  individual civil rights; that it offends the spirit and instinct, and the very letter of due process.  The practice of binding after acquittal, even if we were to assume a proper historical basis for it, which we do not, is an anachronism; it is a vestige of a social form which has passed and it cannot coexist with the modern concept of due process; it has been repealed by change.  Our very jurisprudence is predicated upon rule by law as distinguished from rule by man.  The evil of the practice we are considering is that it is in reality an effective power to punish in virtually unrestrained form.  Suppositions of right to review are in practice unrealistic.  The liberties of the people are not to be committed to such despotic power&nbsp;--&nbsp;be it executive, legislative or judicial; nor are these liberties to be diluted by pretense and supposition that such virtually unreviewable power will be wielded sparingly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the state of the law prior to the 14th amendment we hold that the modern concept of the process has, in any event, rendered obsolete the practice of requiring security after acquittal.  That change and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***68]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  growth are implicit in the concept of due process was indicated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***67]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Wolf v. Colorado, 1947, 338 U.S. 25, 27, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 1361, 93 L.Ed. 1782:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Due process of law thus conveys neither formal nor fixed nor narrow requirements.  It is the compendious expression for all those rights which the courts must enforce because they are basic to our free society.  But basic rights do not become petrified as of any one time, even though, as a matter of human experience, some may not too rhetorically be called eternal verities.  It is of the very nature of a free society to advance in its standards of what is deemed reasonable and right.  Representing as it does a living principle, due process is not confined within a permanent catalogue of what may at a given time be deemed the limits or the essentials of fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'To rely on a tidy formula for the easy determination of what is a fundamental right for purposes of legal enforcement may satisfy a longing for certainty but ignores the movements of a free society. It belittles the scale of the conception of due process.  The real clue to the problem confronting the judiciary in the application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***69]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Due Process Clause is not to ask where the line is once and for all to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***68]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be drawn but to recognize that it is for the Court to draw it by the gradual and empiric process of 'inclusion and exclusion.' Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U.S. 97, 104, 24 L.Ed. 616. This was the Court's insight when first called upon to consider the problem; to this insight the Court has on the whole been faithful as case after case has come before it since Davidson v. New Orleans was decided.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice we have reviewed is in reality not in any real sense a method of 'preventive justice.' When a person is committed for default of entry of security after acquittal he is simply being punished without trial.  If this power so clearly derives from the common law, why does it not exist in a single one of our sister states?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Now, July 15, 1952, the rule heretofore granted upon the District Attorney to show cause why the recognizance required of petitioner should not be quashed and discharged is made absolute.  </SPAN></P>

The company dissolved and the taxpayer carried on the business of the company by himself.

Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 582.1 et seq. and Pittsburgh, Pa., Ordinance 488 enacted under the Act of June 25, 1947, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 2015.1 et seq. Both pieces of legislation imposed a tax on annual gross business transacted. As an individual, the taxpayer failed to file a new mercantile tax return. The taxpayer argued that he should not have been required to pay interest on the deficiency. The court disagreed. The tax was due the date the return was filed and interest properly began to run as of that date. The court found that the fact that the taxpayer had acted in good faith was irrelevant to the question of whether interest should have been imposed against him. The court further concluded that the mercantile taxes self-assessing nature still amounted to a valid tax.</SPAN></P>

Upon the audit of the commissioners' accounts for 1949, the county auditors surcharged them the sum of $ 1,500. In so doing the auditors found that the payment of this money was without authority of any valid law. The court held that a lump sum allowance, or appropriation in gross, for expenses was not per se illegal or contrary to the constitutional prohibition against an increase in salary or emoluments. However, such allowance had to be reasonable to warrant the conclusion that it covered a certified statement of expenses. The greatest expense incurred by the commissioners in connection with the district for any previous year was $ 104.89. A total allowance of $ 3,000 per year was wholly disproportionate and without any reasonable relationship to actual expenses incurred. There was no approach that would permit any other conclusion than that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The issue was one of first impression whether &sect; 35(b) of the Fiduciaries Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, as amended, extended or restricted the statute of limitations.

The court concluded that the company was not barred by any statute of limitations. A person's death did not stop the running of the statute of limitations applicable to any claim against him, but a claim which otherwise was barred within one year after the death of the decedent was not barred until the expiration of one year after his death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between the lessee and the assignee regarding a bailment-lease of a commercial vehicle. The lessee was apparently delinquent in making installment payments. As a result, the assignee sought judgment by confession, as provided for in the lease. Judgment was entered against the lessee, who petitioned to open the same. The lower court denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the assignee's affidavit of value as to the vehicle was binding only as to the replevin action. The averment was merely an admission for purposes of other actions. Regardless of the affidavit, however, the evidence supported the determination as to the value of the vehicle. Furthermore, the judgment by confession did not violate the Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act of 1947, Pamphlet Laws 1110, &sect; 27. That Act, as amended, did not apply to the transaction at issue based on the sale price of the vehicle. Thus, it was irrelevant whether the judgment conformed to the Act's requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner contended that he should have been allowed credit on his sentence for the time he was parole. The court determined under &sect; 10 of the Act of June 11, 1911, P.L. 1055, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 305, credit for time on parole had to be denied to a parole violator. The court explained that under &sect; 4 of the Act of 1893, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 523, such credit could have been denied in the discretion of the parole authorities. The court noted that whether the action of the Board of Parole was mandatory or discretionary, the term of the sentence was not extended. The court concluded that notwithstanding the phraseology of &sect; 4, no time was added to the duration of the prisoner's maximum sentence in denying him credit for the time he was on parole and in requiring him to serve the maximum sentence without credit for the period or periods he was on parole. The court determined that a reformatory prisoner who had violated his parole could have been denied credit, in the discretion of the parole authorities, for the time spent on parole in the computation of the duration of his maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

The Board denied the club license, but the court of quarter sessions granted the veterans' club a liquor license. The Board failed to appeal and refused to issue the license. The following court term the Board sought a rule to show cause why the order should not be reversed, and the court of quarter sessions reversed its earlier decision. On review, the court reversed and reinstated the original decision of the court of quarter sessions. The court noted that after the expiration of the annual term, the court of quarter sessions was without power to reconsider, alter, amend, or to do any act in derogation of its order, adjudication or sentence entered during that term. The rule applied particularly where the time for appeal also had expired. The rule applied even where the purpose of the reconsideration, after the expiration of the term, was to correct an order which was erroneous in law. A litigant could not, by a petition to reconsider an appealable order from which no appeal had been taken within the period allowed by law, reopen the order and thereby nullify the limitation for appeal fixed by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lehigh County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed his conviction by an alderman upon charges of possession of untaxed cigarettes in violation of Act of June 21, 1947, P. L. 911, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 3167.1. The lower court dismissed his motion for arrest of judgment. Defendant contended the Act was unconstitutional because it unlawfully interfered with interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased over 300 cartons of cigarettes in another state. The cigarettes, without tax stamps, were found in the trunk of his car. The trial court found that defendant violated &sect; 3167.1 because he was not a duly licensed dealer and he intended to sell the cigarettes within the state. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 3167.1 was a valid exercise of the State's police powers; it neither created an economic barrier to commerce between the states nor otherwise discriminated against such commerce. A state could enact reasonable laws, under its police powers, relative to interstate commerce, as long as the laws were local in character and only incidentally affected interstate commerce. The court refused to consider defendant's hypothetical examples of how &sect; 3167.1 might burden interstate commerce. According to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 46, &sect; 552(3), it was presumed that the legislature did not intend to violate the state or federal constitutions. Any doubt regarding a statute's constitutionality had to be resolved in favor of the statute.&nbsp;Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 3167.1 did not deny defendant equal protection of law or deprive him of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that the contracts were illegal because the engineers were engaged in the practice of the profession of engineering without a license. They argued that this was contrary to the Act of May 23, 1945, P L. 913, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect; 148 et seq. The pivotal issue was whether the engineers were engaged in the practice of engineering within the meaning of the Act. The engineers admitted that they did not register and obtain a license but argued that the Act was not applicable to them. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment. The court found that a mere cursory examination of the multitude of highly technical and intricate exhibits and drawings prepared by the engineers revealed that engineering knowledge was required and employed. The court held that the acts done and the services performed for the owners were within the scope of the legislative enactment and that the Act of 1945 was a valid and reasonable exercise of the police power. Thus, the engineers were precluded from recovery.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the information charged defendant with operation of his automobile in a residence district at a speed in excess of the maximum indicated by official signs did not take the prosecution out of &sect; 1002(a). The testimony of a peace officer that he timed defendant's speed using a motor vehicle for the purpose, equipped with a speedometer which had been tested for accuracy within 30 days, was competent and sufficient proof of the speed at which defendant was driving. That method of determining speed was not restricted to violations on the open highway or outside of a business or a residence district.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission ordered the Department of Highways to reconstruct a bridge over a railroad crossing in Wilkes-Barre, and allocated the costs to appellants. Appellants objected to the allocation of costs, asserting that the Commonwealth was bound by the Act of May 23, 1945 to pay all such costs for bridges, and sought review in the court. The court affirmed the order of the Commission, holding that the Act had not repealed the Public Utility Law, which permitted the Commission to regulate construction of utility crossings. Specifically, the court held that there was no such repeal because there was no express amendment of the Public Utility Law contained in the Act, which amendment would in any event be unconstitutional. The court further held that the Act amended the law regarding improvements of only those bridges on state highways, which were not under the purview of the Commission. Therefore, the court held that because the bridge in question was a public utility crossing, the Commission had the authority to order the repairs and allocate costs.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the Act, the City's board of health notified the owners of a resolution in which the driveway was declared a nuisance because of improper grading and defective paving. The owners, and other adjoining landowners, were directed to pave the driveway with concrete within 10 days. When neither the owners nor other landowners responded, the City hired the contractor to repave the driveway. The owners were assessed their proportionate cost of the improvement, and a municipal claim was filed against their land for the assessment. The contractor recovered a judgment in a scire facias proceeding. On appeal, the court rejected the owners' claim that the Act unconstitutionally violated their due process rights. The nature and quality of the board's authority to abate a nuisance was unquestionable, the nuisance was established, and the board could not be charged with an abuse of discretion in so declaring. The owners were given an opportunity to be heard, and in the absence of proof to the contrary, the court assumed that paving with concrete was reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance.</SPAN></P>

The employer contended that the employee should not have been granted unemployment compensation for a voluntary suspension of work during an industrial dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee and his associates went out on strike after negotiations with the employer failed. They were awarded unemployment compensation after the waiting period under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 802, which provided compensation for unemployment due to a voluntary suspension of work resulting from an industrial dispute. The court found that the wisdom of the statute was not for the judicial branch unless prohibited by the constitution. The court determined that the statute was constitutional, notwithstanding the employer's attacks based on the increase of taxes or contributions under the &quot;experience rating&quot; provisions of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 781. The court rejected the employer's contention that benefits should have been denied on the theory that the settlement of the labor dispute immediately upon the expiration of benefits showed a lack of good faith because nothing in the act deprived the employee of compensation for such reason. The court concluded that the amendment of the act to provide a reward or adjustment of the employer's contribution under an &quot;experience rating&quot; formula did not render the policy of paying compensation in industrial dispute cases unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Regarding appellant's claim that &sect; 814 unconstitutionally delegated General Assembly powers and did not require that a nuisance be found to exist, the court ruled that state police power authorized the government to regulate land use. The court further found that the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 10603 (1968), permitted local legislative bodies to regulate public health, safety, and welfare through the use of zoning ordinances. Finally, the trial court's fine imposed on de novo review that was greater than the district court's fine was not an abuse of discretion, and thus, there was no error.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision and directed appellant's application be processed in accordance with the Act, holding that the Act was not unconstitutional with reference to nonpublic, nonsectarian schools. The court found that the Act was readily capable of being administered along a sectarian-nonsectarian dichotomy because the reimbursements under the Act went directly to the schools rather than to parents, and it was originally administered with this dichotomy in mind. The court held the act favored severability in order to benefit nonsectarian schools regardless of the fact that the Act was found to be unconstitutional with regard to sectarian schools. Finally, the court found that the Act was not repealed by 24 P.S. &sect; 9-972 (1972) or 24 P.S. &sect; 9-973 (1972) because while there was some duplication among the statutes, the legislature did not intend to eliminate the aid provided for in the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that townhouses were permitted in three zoning areas and under a planned residential development law, and substantial evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that large lot zoning was not prohibitive of townhouse development.

The court affirmed. The court held that evidence that appellant's representatives made calls on business within the state to promote appellant's products was sufficient to show that appellant was doing business within the state and to subject it to taxation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (Pennsylvania), which sustained appellee police commission's order dismissing appellant for immorality and conduct unbecoming an officer in appellant's action challenging his dismissal. Appellant argued that there was insufficient evidence of conduct unbecoming an officer and that the charges filed against him were unconstitutional for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer, a married man, had sexual relations with a married woman in a motel room and at a public park. He was advised by a superior and agreed to cease relations with the woman. The relations resumed days later, and appellant was suspended and served with a statement of charges deemed as immorality and conduct unbecoming an officer. Appellee police commission issued an order dismissing appellant. The trial court upheld the order. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal and held that in applying the community standard, appellant's adultery, committed while not in uniform and off duty in a public motel and a public park, was immorality and conduct unbecoming an officer under 53 P.S. &sect; 46190(4). Police officers were held to a higher standard of conduct, and the state had a compelling interest in maintaining a high degree of public respect. Adultery by appellant, whether in private or in public, affected the morale of the department and reduced appellant's effectiveness in the community. Further, the charges did not violate the vagueness doctrine because appellant was advised and agreed to cease the adulterous conduct days prior to the suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, which upheld appellee police commission's order dismissing appellant police officer because his adulterous conduct committed off duty in a public motel and at a public park constituted immorality and conduct unbecoming an officer. Further, the supervisor's warning to appellant to cease the adulterous conduct days prior to the suspension was adequate notice of the charges and satisfied the vagueness doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant operator challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the suspension of appellant's driving privileges by appellee state. Appellant contended that his arrest was unlawful because the arresting officer, a policeman for the Borough of Carlisle, lacked authority to cross the borough line into North Middleton Township to make an arrest in pursuit of a misdemeanant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant operator was arrested for driving while intoxicated. When he refused to submit to a breath test, his driving privileges were suspended under 75 P.S. &sect; 624.1(a). He unsuccessfully appealed, arguing that the arresting officer was a borough policeman and lacked statutory authority under 19 P.S. &sect; 11 (amended 1973) to arrest him outside the borough's boundary. On appeal, appellant argued that &sect; 624.1(a) was unconstitutional in not requiring a lawful arrest in order to request a driver to submit to a breath test. The court disagreed, noting that appellant's arrest was unlawful only due to a statutory limitation on the officer's jurisdiction, which did not apply to license suspension proceedings as a matter of state law. The officer observed appellant driving erratically on a borough roadway before stopping him a few blocks away outside borough limits. Appellant's breath smelled of alcohol, and he admitted having had a few drinks. The court affirmed the lower court's finding that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe appellant was driving while intoxicated, and held that the reviewing court did not err in considering the officer's observations after stopping appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellee state's suspension of appellant operator's driver's license, holding that the lawfulness of neither the borough officer's stop nor his arrest of appellant was significant in this case, because the purpose was to request appellant, who was suspected of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, to submit to a breathalyzer test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, property owner and lessee, were denied zoning approval for the construction of a gasoline service station. On appeal, the trial court ordered appellant township to issue appellees a building permit. The court reversed and reinstated the order of the zoning hearing board, holding that the permit was properly denied on the basis of appellees' failure to comply with the 500-foot spacing requirement, found in Westtown Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 301(k). The ordinance prohibited two service stations from being located within 500 feet of one another on the same side of the road. The court observed that there were many locations still available where the restriction would not present a problem. Moreover, the court found that 500 feet was not an unduly restrictive spacing requirement because two of the three existing commercial districts were located along major traffic arteries. Therefore, the court concluded that it was within the proper exercise of appellant's police power to limit access and to attempt to reduce the number of accidents, which might otherwise be caused by cars entering or leaving the roadway.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment that upheld appellee's decision. Appellants challenged the zoning ordinance based on their assertion that, by refusing to rezone, appellee was engaging in &quot;reverse spot zoning.&quot; The court noted that the singling out of one lot or a small area for different treatment from that accorded to similar surrounding land indistinguishable from it in character, for the economic benefit of the owner or to his economic detriment, was invalid &quot;spot&quot; zoning. However, the court found that the land in question was not surrounded by land that was being treated differently. Rather, it was bounded on the one side by a residential district and on the other side by a professional office district. At the zoning hearing there was an honest difference of opinion expressed as to how the land should be zoned. Therefore, the court could not disturb the legislative decision because the validity of the legislation was fairly debatable, and the legislative judgment controlled.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth's Department of Revenue refused to allow the deduction and issued an assessment for taxes owed.

The court dismissed the appeal, and held that appellants could not deduct unreimbursed business expenses from taxable income, because 72 P.

The court found that &sect; 7301's provision for excluding payments to reimburse actual business expenses could not be construed to also allow deduction of unreimbursed expense from taxable income. The court held that the refusal to allow the deduction was not unconstitutional under the uniformity clause of the Pa. Const., art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant, a New York corporation, filed its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax return, the Department of Revenue disagreed with the method employed by appellant in the computation of its tax liability, and settled the tax due to a higher amount. The Board of Finance and Revenue affirmed the determination. On appeal, the court affirmed the order below. The court adopted the commonwealth's interpretation of &sect;&sect; 401(3)(1), 401(3)(2), of Article IV of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. &sect; 7401 et seq. The court held that when computing its tax base for purposes of the Pennsylvania corporate net income tax, a corporation whose entire business was not transacted in Pennsylvania may apportion its taxable income except insofar as said taxable income represented the &quot;add-back&quot; of that corporation's federal tax deduction for the Pennsylvania corporate net income tax. The failure of the Pennsylvania corporate net income tax to provide for the apportionment of the federal deduction for said tax was not unconstitutional and, in fact, guaranteed equality of treatment to both local and multistate corporations subject to the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pennsylvania's Parent Reimbursement Act for Non-Public Education, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 5701, was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, plaintiff Pennsylvania Parent Assistance Authority was unable to reimburse parents who sent their children to non-public schools. The governor of Pennsylvania approved Act No. 18, which placed monies that that were in the Parent Reimbursement Fund into the commonwealth's general fund. Plaintiff was the fiduciary of the Parent Reimbursement Fund. Plaintiff sought to enjoin defendant Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from transferring the monies in the Fund and to have defendant pay plaintiff's administrative vouchers. The court denied plaintiff's motion. The court found that ongoing federal litigation of matters involving the Parent Reimbursement Act did not justify a clear conclusion that any parents would have been entitled to reimbursements. Dissipation of the Fund did not mean parents would not get reimbursements. Plaintiff offered no evidence as to administrative vouchers.</SPAN></P>

The Secretary notified appellant that his license and registration would be suspended under the Vehicle Code, 75 P.S. &sect; 1413, for failure to satisfy the judgment. The lower court affirmed the secretary's suspension of appellant's license. Appellant challenged the ruling, contending the suspension based solely on the default judgment, without any evidence of negligence, was a denial of due process and an abuse of discretion. The court affirmed the lower court ruling. The purpose of &sect; 1413 was not to punish negligent drivers, but to protect the public from the financial irresponsibility of those who have had judgments entered against them from motor vehicle accidents. This was a legitimate state interest. Once the claim was reduced to a judgment, there was no requirement for a hearing as to negligence before license revocation.

The court reversed the order, holding that the PRD request was not the proper subject matter of a curative amendment submission, under &sect; 1004 of the Municipalities Planning Code (MPD), 53 P.S. &sect; 11004(1)(b), as PRD provisions were not mandated by MPC and no one could compel their enforcement. The case was remanded to appellee for a determination of whether a four-plex unit was an excluded use under the ordinance. Because appellant's curative amendment submission was overbroad, the trial court was instructed to exercise its broad supervisory powers of review, as the township could not be compelled to pass appellant's submission and would not be able to enact a reasonable and proper curative amendment in a reasonable time.

Appellant alleged that appellees miscalculated their taxes under 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 584.3 by applying a net income limitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants interstate commerce corporations were subject to taxation by appellant city school district but objected to appellant's assessment of delinquencies in their payments. The lower court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment and allowed appellees to calculate their taxes based on an interpretation of 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 584.3, which allowed appellees to apply a net income limitation to their tax allocation. On appeal, the court analyzed the statute for uniformity and found that the net income limitation violated uniformity because it allowed a ceiling on tax liability of a gross receipts tax to be measured by net income. The court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional, but that removing the severable provision from the statute regarding the net income limitation would cure the defect.</SPAN></P>

Another agency was engaged in a project which it knew would result in damages to some of appellant's equipment. Appellant and the agency agreed on a price to be paid by the agency to cover the damage. Appellant used the funds, and added some of its own, to not only replace, but upgrade the facilities. Appellee elected to exclude the amount contributed by appellant from the original cost of the improvements. The court determined that there was evidence in the record that costs rose materially , but all of those factors were taken into account in the trending processes used by appellee, and all of the parties to this case, and, that appellee did not abuse its discretion. The court determined that there was no specified formula by which to determine fair value, and that there was sufficient substantial evidence to support appellee's final determination as to fair rate of return. The court affirmed as to all aspects of the order other than the exclusion of the damages amount from the original cost of the improvements.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff, a president of a milk company, testified before the grand jury regarding contracts between his milk company and the city.

Plaintiff brought an action in quo warranto to challenge the legality of the office held by defendant deputy attorney general and his actions, along with the actions of his subordinates, under the authority of that office. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The court held that plaintiff had standing to bring the action in quo warranto as an individual with a special interest in testing the legality of the office beyond that of the general public. The court concluded that defendant was appointed to a lawful office for a proper and lawful purpose and that he was acting within the scope and authority of that office in investigating and prosecuting charges against plaintiff.

The city provided the information, and appellant paid the taxes. Appellant's request for a refund was denied by appellee Tax Review Board of the City of Philadelphia, and the lower court affirmed. The court affirmed. Appellant had shown no mistake of fact permitting a refund under Philadelphia, Pa., Code of Municipal Ordinances &sect; 19-1703(1)(a). The taxes paid were properly due to appellant. No mistake was made as to the tax, its amount, or the property on which it was paid. Instead, appellant's mistake was its own authority from its mortgagor, the taxpayer, to pay the tax. Evidence that the proper taxpayer-corporation might have been bankrupt at the time appellant discovered its mistake did not affect this determination, since there was no evidence that the corporation was in bankruptcy at the time the tax was paid.</SPAN></P>

Defendants raised preliminary objections challenging the personal jurisdiction of the court as violating their due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as well as other objections. The court overruled the objections. It first held that mailed solicitations by an out-of-state charity were, for purposes of the minimal contacts test, comparable to a much greater activity by a commercial enterprise, and that defendants established minimal contacts by mailing of solicitations to residents. The court held that the method of service provided in 10 P.S. &sect; 160-14 did not impinge upon defendants' due process rights, that the court's subject matter jurisdiction did not unconstitutionally invade the domain of the federal government in matters involving the use of the mails, and that notice and a hearing were not conditions precedent to commencement of a &sect; 160-14 action based on failure to file a registration statement.</SPAN></P>

It upheld the board's holding that none of appellant's constitutional rights were violated, despite the fact that it was impossible for appellant to legally utilize the chosen processing method, because 35 P.S. &sect; 4006.1, as applied to appellant, was a reasonable exercise of the commonwealth's police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review when their appeal of the denial of their application for a curative amendment to the Upper Oxford Township, Penn. Ordinances, art. IV was dismissed. The court remanded the case ordering the lower court to make appropriate findings of fact after concluding that it was unable to properly review the matter because the record was insufficient. Appellants wanted an amendment to enable them to develop their tract of property with lot sizes less than the two acre minimum mandated by the ordinance. Because the administrative body did not make a decision within 30 days after the hearing was held, the amendment request was deemed denied pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect; 11004(4)(iii). The lower court dismissed the appeal without hearing additional evidence. The appellate court found that it was unable to consider appellants' challenges because the record was lacking findings of fact. It held, therefore, that irrespective of the fact that 53 P.S. &sect; 11010 did not require findings of fact when reviewing the denial of a curative amendment, it was the duty of the lower court to make appropriate findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the owner of a 40-acre tract of land located in appellee township. Appellant's land was currently zoned agricultural, which limited non-agricultural uses to lots of 60,000 square feet. Appellant desired to build 280 townhouses on his property, and filed a challenge with appellee's board of supervisors pursuant to 53 Pa.

Another allegation of the challenge was that there was a need for moderately priced dwellings that could be best provided by cluster-type townhouses such as those proposed by appellant. The board dismissed appellant's appeal, and the trial court affirmed. The court reversed, holding that the ordinance in question, on its face, totally prohibited townhouses, a legitimate and needed residential use and that, therefore, it was invalid. The court remanded the matter to the trial court for the purpose of determining whether the plans and other materials submitted by appellant should be ordered approved in whole or in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review when he was convicted of violating an ordinance regulating picketing activities for committing assault and battery against another employee while engaged in picketing in front of his employer's place of business. He challenged the denial of his appeal. The court reversed the order denying his appeal and his judgment, concluding that the township exceeded its authority in attempting to regulate picketing activities. The court reasoned that the First Class Township Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 55101 et seq., granted townships the power to provide regulations on many subjects, but did not mention picketing. It concluded that the township was without the authority to regulate picketing, and that the ordinance was unauthorized. Further, since appellant was actually convicted of assault and battery, the court found that the township again exceeded its authority by attempting to punish an activity punishable by Act of Assembly, 18 P.S. &sect; 4406, as a violation of a township ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee homeowner was charged generally with violating appellant borough's ordinance that made it unlawful for any person to accumulate junked, abandoned or discarded vehicles, trailers, boats, appliances, or household furnishings on private or public property. Appellee enacted the ordinance pursuant to the power it was given by the Borough Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 46202. Appellee appeared before a district justice, was found guilty, and ordered to pay a fine and costs. At a de novo hearing in the trial court, the judge remarked that he had just read the ordinance, and that it was unconstitutional. The hearing was terminated by the judge's expressed desire that the borough not continue because to do so would have been useless. The judge thereupon adjudged appellee not guilty. On appeal, judgment was reversed, and a venire facias de novo was awarded. The court held that legislative enactments were presumed to be constitutional, and that the courts could not substitute their judgment for that of the legislature. The court held that even if parts of the ordinance were invalid, the judge could not have deemed the entire ordinance unconstitutional after reading it only one time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought a variance to use certain portions of their land as a tractor-trailer repair facility in a residential district. Appellants claimed that prior to the purchase of the property, the former landowners operated an automobile repair shop. Appellee zoning hearing board (board) denied appellant's variance. The lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court likewise affirmed. The court held that there was no basis for the court to grant the relief requested because the zoning ordinance that controlled the use of appellants' land was in effect for several years prior to their purchase. The court also held that the operation of a trailer repair compound was not in the public interest in the area. The court further held that appellants were entitled to continue the nonconforming use that was being conducted on the property at the time the ordinance was enacted. However, appellants were entitled to only reasonable expansion, the extent of which was to be determined by the board, and, as such, it was within the board's discretion to deny appellants' variance.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, water company and its customers, filed suit against defendant state officials seeking to restrain defendants from performing construction work on a highway.

The court denied defendants' motion for judgment of the pleadings. The court discussed the standards for ruling on motions for judgment on the pleadings and recognized that a party moving for judgment of the pleadings admits for the purposes of the motion all of the allegations of the opposing party. The court rejected defendants' contention that plaintiff's had an adequate remedy at law because plaintiffs denied that eminent domain gave them an adequate remedy at law since they could not obtain a restraining order in an eminent domain proceeding.

The court found testimony that revealed that before any permit had been issued, prescriptions were dispensed in the store where appellant had asked permission to operate, in violation of 63 P.S. &sect; 390-2(11). The court concluded appellant had violated several sections of the Act by operating a pharmacy without a permit in violation of 63 P.S. &sect; 390-4(h), preventing an inspector from entering the pharmacy in violation of 63 P.S. &sect; 390-8(5), and conducting business as a drug store without a license in violation of 63 P.S. &sect; 390-8(8).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, individuals on behalf of all the residents of appellant municipality, filed a petition for preliminary injunction alleging that a sewage tap-in fee, front-foot assessment, and monthly service fees were excessive and unreasonable, and prayed that appellant municipality and sewage authority be enjoined from collecting these fees, and that the ordinance enforcing payment of such fees be set aside as unconstitutional. The court reversed the lower court's preliminary injunction restraining appellants from enforcing the ordinance requiring property owners to tap into the sewer system or be subject to fines, and reversed the lower court's decree nisi concluding that as a matter of law, the front-foot assessment was unreasonable and inequitable as it applied to substandard housing and vacant lots. The court held that rate-making was the exclusive function of the authority under 53 P.S. &sect; 306B(h), and the lower court's duty was to determine the uniformity and reasonableness of the rate, not whether it would choose a different method of establishing reasonable and uniform rates.

The court reaffirmed its holding that the court martial statute, Administrative Code &sect; 711, 71 P.S. &sect; 251, and its related regulations were constitutional, and rejected as irrelevant plaintiff's contention that he was improperly suspended without a prior hearing. In deciding whether defendant commissioner had expressed in a conversation with plaintiff, that plaintiff was guilty, the court credited defendant commissioner's version of the conversation; defendant commissioner's statements only apprised the plaintiff that there was evidence against him and suggested that resignation should be considered, a common practice known to plaintiff. Defendant commissioner's rules would allow plaintiff to challenge allegedly prejudiced defendant board members, and disqualifying from the board all members subordinate to plaintiff would disqualify every member of the force except defendant commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant resident violated Williamsport, Pa., Ordinance 2765 art. 721 (May 7, 1959) when he failed to cut the grass at his property located in appellant city. Appellant contended that the weed ordinance was facially unconstitutional because it was an invalid exercise of the police power, it denied him due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it was vague and did not provide for preabatement hearings, and the fines were in violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The nuisance ordinance was a reasonable exercise of police power because weeds allowed to grow to excess affected the public health by producing allergenic pollen noxious odors. Substantive and procedural due process were satisfied because the taking of uncultivated weeds and grass was not a significant property interest. The common meaning of the words &quot;grass&quot; and &quot;weeds&quot; gave appellant an adequate standard by which to gauge his conduct. The fines were reasonable, and the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellee did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner in refusing to address appellant's charge that it was prejudicially composed given the fact that no judicial officer had a direct, personal or substantial pecuniary interest in the outcome of the controversy. A clerical error mislabeling two of the medical doctors as &quot;O.D.'s&quot; on a list of board members did not change the fact that the composition of the board met all legal requirements.

The court held that the local court rule and hearings conducted by the trial court offered appellants due process incident to the allowance of the issuance of writs of capias ad respondendum.

The court determined that plaintiffs' action against defendants president and secretary was also barred by the doctrine, because sovereign immunity extended to high public officials acting officially within the scope of their authority with respect to official communications and acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board issued a final order, which included a determination that a county, acting through its commissioners, was the public employer of the court-related employees of that county as defined under the Public Employee Relations Act (Act), 43 P.S. &sect; 1101.101 et seq. Appellant judges challenged this determination and argued that they or the court itself were the public employer of such employees. The court disagreed and affirmed the order. Under the Act, 43 P.S. &sect; 1101.301, the court found that the county was a public employer as it was considered a &quot;political subdivision&quot; within the Act's definition of a public employer, and that court-related employees were considered public employees thereunder as well. The court held that the Act as it applied to court-related personnel did not interfere with the proper function of the courts or the administration of justice to constitute a legislative encroachment upon the judicial branch of the state government. The court found, therefore, that the Act did not violate Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 which established a unified judicial system as a separate and independent branch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner purchased land that adjoined a major highway and was used for automobile and truck repairs. The township enacted a zoning ordinance which zoned appellant's land as interchange or beautification and allowed the land to be used only for growing grasses, flowers, and shrubbery. After appellant's petition for a variance was finally granted, appellant filed a petition to change the zoning of his property to general commercial. When appellee board of supervisors denied the application and the trial court affirmed, appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), 53 P.S. &sect; 10101 et seq. did not provide that a landowner could appeal from the rezoning of an area in which his land was located. The court found that the validity or constitutionality of an enactment would not be decided until the enactment was actually applied. The court found that the MPC only provided a right to appeal from decisions of the zoning hearing board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shopping center sought to enlarge its facility by constructing a new retail store located separately at the northern edge of its property. It applied for a permit, which was denied by the building inspector, and this denial was upheld by appellee zoning board (Board). The trial court, which took no additional evidence on appeal, affirmed the Board. The issue on appeal was the number of parking spaces that appellant had to provide for the new store as required by Haverford Township, Pa., Ordinance 1326 (Dec. 11, 1967). The shopping center contended that the existing spaces were legally sufficient for the entire shopping center, even with the addition of the new store. After review, this court concluded that Ordinance 1326 was applicable to the entire shopping center, and that appellant had to provide additional spaces for the new store. It could not be permitted to reduce its current parking facilities by attributing some of those spaces to the new store. The building inspector acted correctly by refusing to grant the building permit. The lower court's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city approved an ordinance which imposed upon each parking transaction, by a patron of a nonresidential parking place, a tax of 20 percent on the consideration for each transaction. Appellants challenged the ordinance pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act (Act), Pa. Stat. tit. 53, &sect; 6906. Appellee city filed preliminary objections which included a demurrer on the ground that the complaint relied on an unconstitutional delegation of taxing power to the judiciary. The lower court sustained the demurrer and dismissed appellants' petition. The court reversed the lower court's ruling. The lower court ruled that appellants lacked standing. The court disagreed and found that appellants, both parking lot operators and individuals, had standing to challenge the tax under the Act. Further, the court found that the Act was constitutional and did not improperly delegate legislative power to the judiciary. The power to invalidate a taxing measure in whole or in part was not the power to tax, as asserted by the lower court. Also, the power to reduce the rates of taxes, did not, in the court's view, confer upon the court the power to tax.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that appellee PUC did not abuse its discretion by concluding that negative environmental effects could be minimized by careful construction and line selection, and the implementation of work quality standards. The court affirmed a finding that appellee energy company was a public utility even though it only served a few customers, and that the proposed pipeline construction did not violate Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff townships sought an order from the court directing defendant state officials, to distribute monies collected under Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PURTA), 72 P. S. &sect; 3271, et seq., for the calendar year 1970 to all local taxing authorities in the Commonwealth, attorney counsel fees, and to make an accounting. The court overruled the preliminary objections of defendant auditor general finding that defendant auditor general obviously had responsibilities in connection with the constitutional mandate and the legislative scheme of distributing PURTA tax dollars. The court also found that defendants did not have sovereign immunity because the action sought to enforce a constitutional mandate. The laches defense failed because there was nothing on the record that would permit the court to rule as a matter of law that defendants had been prejudiced by the delay. The forfeiture provision of 72 P. S. &sect; 3276 was constitutional and because plaintiff school district failed to file the reports required of all local taxing authorities the court held that plaintiff school district had failed to state a cause of action, and the preliminary objections of defendants were sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appellee filed a petition for a declaratory judgment to have 53 P.S. &sect; 101, which established city classifications and permitted cities to determine by ordinance which classification to adopt, declared unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court below granted the petition, and appellant city sought review. The court reversed. The statute in issue did not unlawfully delegate the legislative power to determine city classifications under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 20. The legislature exercised this power in establishing the framework of classifications in the statute, and it was not an unconstitutional delegation to permit city legislative bodies to decide which of those classifications would be operative for a particular city. The classification, which relied upon population levels, was not special and local legislation even though only three cities within the state fell into the designated range at the time of enactment. The statute's application was not limited to those cities, because any city's population had the potential to increase or decrease to bring that city within the designated classifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court order finding a statute unconstitutional which permitted cities, by ordinance, to determine their municipal classifications, because the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate the legislative power itself, but merely permitted the city to select a classification within a framework established by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the second ordinance to be valid. Appellant neighboring property owners appealed. The court, at the outset, held that it was vested with jurisdiction even though appellants did not seek first to appeal to the zoning board of adjustment. The court held that, while the doctrine of res judicata was not dispositive of the appeal, collateral estoppel prevented the relitigation of various determinations. The court held that the second ordinance was not invalid on the basis of the purpose for which it was enacted, and that appellee either a present or an anticipated nuisance. The court found no basis for awarding punitive damages, but held that the second ordinance was invalid as spot zoning, because the ordinance thrust a commercially zoned peninsula into a residential sea without any apparent necessity for so radical a change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Adams County (Pennsylvania), which concluded that appellant had not met its burden of proving that an observation tower proposed to be constructed by appellee landowners on the site of the battle of Gettysburg would so injure the values protected by Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 27, as to justify an order restraining erection of the tower.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowners proposed building an observation tower on the Gettysburg battlefield, on private land not subject to federal regulation. Appellant commonwealth sought to restrain erection of the tower based on Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 27, which imposed a public trust on appellant to maintain and conserve the state's natural resources on the people's behalf. The lower court denied relief, holding that appellant had not established by clear and convincing evidence that the tower would injure constitutionally protected values to such a degree as to warrant the extraordinary injunctive relief sought. Appellees had agreed to locate the tower at a site acceptable to the National Park Service for the purpose of minimizing its adverse impact. The lower court made detailed findings concerning the tower, the commercial neighborhood, the agreement, and an ultimate finding that the tower would not injure natural, scenic, historic, or esthetic values but would provide educational benefit to those who used the park. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that appellant had not borne its burden of proof, and finding no clear error in the chancellor's fact findings and legal conclusions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that plaintiffs failed to show how the redistricting diluted their vote, and held that the special election must be held in the new senatorial district because the newly created district was the constitutional, legal, valid and proper district for all future elections, and that the writ of election was properly issued for the new senatorial district.

The court granted respondents' motion to strike because the complaint asserted to be a class action, but plaintiffs did not allege that parties they contended to represent suffered the same or similar harms. Plaintiffs improperly described the class as including everyone in Pennsylvania.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania), which directed appellant to revoke the suspension of appellee driver's motor vehicle privileges. Appellant challenged the lower court's denial of its motion to quash, and its finding that appellant's action was unconstitutional under &sect; 1413 of the Vehicle Code, 75 P.S. &sect; 1413.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver had his motor vehicle privileges suspended twice by appellant, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Appellee's challenge through a petition for special allowance of supersedeas, which the trial court recognized as an appeal of the suspension, was allowed on the ground that &sect; 1413 of the Vehicle Code, 75 P.S. &sect; 1413, was unconstitutional. Appellant alleged that &sect; 1413 was constitutional and that the lower court erred in not granting its motion to quash. The court reversed the lower court's order. The court held that appellee had the right to take seek review of appellant's action, but his right was limited by the 30-day time period in &sect; 620 of the Vehicle Code, 75 P.S. &sect; 620. Although &sect; 1413 did not specifically provide for an appeal, &sect; 620 provided that remedy to appellant through Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 9, which granted a right of appeal to all citizens from an adjudication of an administrative agency. Appellee's challenge of his license suspension was untimely filed. Therefore, the court ordered the reinstatement of the suspension of appellee's motion vehicle privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order denying appellant, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's, motion to quash appellee driver's claim that his motor vehicle license be reinstated. The court held that the Vehicle Code was constitutional because appellee had the right to challenge it under the Administrative Agency Law. However, appellee's challenge of appellant's action was untimely filed; license suspension was reinstated.</SPAN></P>
