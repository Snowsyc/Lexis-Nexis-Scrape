</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through a criminal petition to transfer, appellee challenged a judgment from the First District Court of Appeals (Indiana), in which that court sustained appellant state's request for review and reversed a previous ruling granting appellee's motion to suppress evidence obtained at a roadblock of appellee's driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state police conducted a roadblock, stopping five consecutive cars at a time, and waving others through for the time it took to conduct the check on the five cars being inspected. After each group of five was inspected and released, the next five consecutive vehicles were detained for the same procedure. All stopped motorists were asked to produce licenses or registrations. If a violation was suspected or alcohol consumption detected, the driver was then pulled over to an adjacent parking lot. Upon its granting transfer, the court and reversed. The court held the roadblock constitutional under a three-factor test: 1) the state's legitimate concern in checking for automobile registration and certification and society's grave concern in apprehending and deterring drunken driving, 2) the high success rate of the roadblock in detecting drunken driving and the deterrent effect of its visibility, and 3) the low degree of interference with individual liberty, given the two to three minute stops per vehicle. The court concluded by holding that to the extent McLaughlin v. State, 471 N.E.2d 1125 (Ind. App. 1984), conflicted with the instant court's holding, it was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for transfer, reversed the suppression of the evidence in question, and ordered the trial level judge to proceed with the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to murder, kidnapping, and rape and was sentenced to death. He appealed, claiming that the imposition of the death penalty after the plea of guilty but mentally ill violated a statutory right to treatment and the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of intentional killing, and that the death penalty statute, Ind. Code &sect; 30-50-2-9 (1985), was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence. The court noted that defendant stated that he understood the plea and understood that he would receive the same sentence and penalty as a defendant found guilty of the offense. The court held that defendant illustrated a full understanding of the plea and the risk he was taking and of his willingness to strategically take that risk. The court also held that the evidence, which showed that defendant overpowered the victim and strangled her to death, clearly supported the trial court's finding of an intentional killing. The court further held that no reasonable person could find that the death penalty was arbitrarily or capriciously applied or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision of the St. Joseph County Superior Court (Indiana) that denied his request for post-conviction relief. At issue was the fact that the trial court failed to advise the inmate of a possibility of an increased sentence in accordance with Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-1-3 (amended and recodified as Ind. Code &sect; 35-35-1-2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court accepted the inmate's guilty plea to burglary pursuant to a plea agreement. Following his conviction, the inmate sought post-conviction relief, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the inmate argued that during the guilty plea proceedings, the trial court failed to inform him of the possibility of an increased sentence by reason of a prior conviction, with the result that his guilty plea was not intelligently entered. In affirming, the court agreed that the trial court omitted the requisite statutory inquiry and plea advisements. However, the burden of proof was on the inmate to show that had he been properly advised, he would have changed his decision to plea. Here, at the post-conviction hearing, the inmate presented no evidence other than a transcript of the guilty plea and sentencing hearings. There was no proof that he would not have entered his plea of guilty if he had been specifically advised that the presumptive sentence could have been increased by reason of his prior conviction. Accordingly, the inmate failed to meet his burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pleaded guilty to attempted voluntary manslaughter pursuant to a written plea agreement. The trial court denied his request for post-conviction relief, and the inmate appealed. He argued that his plea of guilty was not entered voluntarily and intelligently because the trial court failed to advise him of the possible increase in sentence by reason of a prior conviction. In affirming, the court noted that no testimony was presented regarding whether the inmate had been convicted of a prior crime, nor was there any evidence whatsoever suggesting that there was a causal link between the omitted advisement and the decision to enter a plea of guilty. Accordingly, the inmate failed to meet his burden to show that the trial judge's failure to strictly comply with the applicable statute rendered his guilty plea involuntary or unintelligent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary. Affirming, the court found that the trial court did not err by refusing to grant defendant additional peremptory challenges following the dismissal of charges against his codefendants. Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-1-3 allowed defendant and his codefendants 10 peremptory challenges to be exercised jointly. The charges against the codefendants were dismissed when only one peremptory challenge remained. Defendant was not entitled to additional peremptory challenges because they were not a matter of constitutional right, but a matter of statutory grant that could not be expanded or restricted by judicial interpretation. Even so, defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the limitation by reason that he was unable to challenged the judgment of a specific juror. Because defendant did not raise the unconstitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-1-3 in his motion to correct errors, he preserved nothing for review on the claim. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance in order to allow more time for preparation because defendant was not prejudiced.

The court held that there was no prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor asked potential jurors of their acquaintance with potential defense witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, sought review of a judgment from the Madison Circuit Court (Indiana), which ruled in favor of appellee driver in his action for an injunction to prohibit the suspension of his license and declared that the administrative suspension procedures of the Habitual Traffic Offender Act, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 9-12-1-1 through 9-12-3-3 (Supp. 1984), were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver received a letter stating that his license was going to be suspended because he was an habitual traffic offender under Ind.

That order issued on the ground that one of the three traffic offenses charged against the driver had been dismissed. During a later hearing, the Bureau did not contest that evidence, and a preliminary injunction issued. On the driver's motion for a summary judgment, the court held that the administrative suspension procedures of the Habitual Traffic Offender Act were unconstitutional under the &quot;due course of law&quot; provisions of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The Bureau appealed. The court agreed with the trial court that the driver was not an habitual traffic offender subject to a license suspension. However, the court held that the trial court erred in deciding the constitutional question. The constitutional question did not have to be decided in order to resolve the case, and as such, the trial court should not have considered it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the ruling of the trial court on the constitutionality of the Habitual Traffic Offender Act. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding that the driver was not an habitual traffic offender.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and sentence. In doing so, the court held that Indiana's statutes and procedures for sentencing were proper because actual proportionality review was not necessary and that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution did not require a state appellate court to compare the sentence in the case before it with the penalties imposed in similar cases. The court also held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying the motion for a change of venue because all of the publicity alluded to by defendant, except for one article, occurred approximately one full year before the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sought post-conviction relief after his attempted murder conviction was affirmed. The trial court denied his petition, and the court affirmed on appeal. The jury in the inmate's initial trial was properly instructed that the state of mind required for attempted murder was a knowing attempt to kill. The reference in case law to a specific intent to kill as the culpability element of attempted murder had been clarified to include a knowing attempt to kill. The inmate failed to raise at the trial court or on direct appeal the issue of whether a master commissioner's denial of the inmate's motion for change of venue was an unconstitutional exercise of authority. Moreover, the trial court in which the trial took place had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the inmate. Defense counsel was not ineffective. It was trial strategy for counsel not to impeach the State's witnesses because such impeachment might have established a possible motive for the shooting. Although counsel failed to timely move for a mistrial upon discovering that the jury foreman was a county commissioner, there was no bias or impartiality on the part of the foreperson to be implied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury had recommended against the death penalty but the trial court, in accordance with Ind.

The court did, however, find procedural deficiencies in the imposition of the death sentence by the trial court requiring that the sentence be vacated. The state submitted only two aggravating factors for consideration. The procedural problem arose with the aggravating factor of defendant's conviction of another murder. At the time the jury considered the death penalty, defendant had not been convicted of any murder because no judgment of conviction had yet been entered. Therefore, that aggravating factor did not support a death penalty finding. By the time the trial court made its decision on the death penalty, the judgment of conviction had been entered. But, &sect; 35-50-2-9(e) required that the trial court base its decision on the same standards that the jury was required to consider and those standards did not support the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pub. L. No. 355-1985, &sect; 1 (Ind.) amended Ind. Code &sect; 36-10-7-5 to provide that township trustee in townships with a specified population were to appoint a professional park superintendent subject to the approval of the township's advisory board. Only North Township fit into the population specifications of amended &sect; 36-10-7-5, and the township was a highly urban area that contained a large park that had golf and tennis facilities and numerous buildings. Upon appeal, the trial court's judgment was reversed. The court held that an act of the legislature was to be afforded a presumption of constitutionality and that the challenger of the legislative act bore the burden to rebut that presumption. The court ruled that the fact that only one governmental unit was governed by the amendment did not render the amendment improper because the terms of the amendment permitted other units to qualify. Thus, the act was not unconstitutional special legislation. The court also ruled that the classification based on population was rational, and thus valid, because a large park in a heavily urban area may have required a professional superintendent to manage it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his petition for post-conviction relief, and the court affirmed on appeal. It was not unconstitutional to charge the inmate with murder by way of information filed by the prosecutor rather than by indictment of a grand jury. The trial court acted properly pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-3.1-1-1(a), and there was no constitutional impediment to dispensing with the grand jury in state prosecutions. In addition, the inmate waived any alleged error. The inmate failed to show prejudice resulting from a 70-hour detainment in jail before he was brought before a magistrate. The inmate also waived such issue. The issue of whether the trial court erred in refusing to release the inmate on bond prior to trial was moot because he was already tried and found guilty. There was more than sufficient direct evidence, including an eyewitness, before the jury to support its verdict. A misnomer on the process that brought the inmate before the trial court for his commitment was moot. The trial court fully considered all aggravating and mitigating circumstances pursuant to Ind.

The court held that the trial court was not required to appoint an expert that defendant chose, thus its denial of defendant's motion for fees for an expert was not an abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a change of venue, because of the community prejudice, and when it did not allow him to separate the prospective jurors for voir dire. Defendant also claimed that he was entitled to a psychiatrist at the State's expense and that he was not allowed an expert to assist in the trial. The court determined that defendant failed to prove that any prejudice existed among the jurors selected and it was within the trial court's discretion to deny defendant's request for a continuance. The court held that it was also within the trial court's discretion to conduct the voir dire and defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court allowing written questions to be submitted and the voir dire conducted collectively. The court also held that defendant was provided a psychiatric examination and assistance during the trial and that the jury did not believe that defendant was insane by its verdict, which concluded that defendant committed the offenses intentionally and knowingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict because the State failed to prove that defendant knowingly killed another. On appeal, the court held that the jury was warranted in determining that defendant knowingly killed his four-year-old daughter from the evidence showing the small size of the child, the large quantity of pepper found in her respiratory and digestive tracts, and the manner of the force employed upon her face and jaw. The court concluded that the State only needed to prove that defendant knew that his acts created a high probability of death by choking. Defendant also argued that the trial court committed fundamental error in its instructions regarding the verdict of guilty but mentally ill at the time of the crime. The court held that the trial court's instruction to the jury to first find whether the State proved the elements of the crime and whether defendant proved an incapacitating mental defect, and then whether defendant was suffering at the time of the crime was proper. The court rejected defendant's claim that the verdict of guilty but mentally ill was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of four counts of murder. The death penalty was imposed because defendant had knowingly killed during the commission of a burglary and defendant had killed more than one person. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court did not err when it decided to hold another competency hearing in view of evidence defendant may have been faking his psychosis; (2) the trial court did not err when it denied defendant's request for a change of judge at the time of his fourth competency hearing in view of the advanced stage of the case and the lack of prejudice of the presiding judge; (3) the trial court did not err when it permitted a witness of questionable mental competency to testify at trial, as it had an opportunity to observe the witness and the evidence on his competency was susceptible of conflicting inferences; (4) that defendant was not harmed by any alleged errors contained in his presentence report; and, (5) the death penalty was appropriate considering the nature of the offense and the character of the offender.

</DIV>

The court held that facts set forth in the affidavit, submitted by the non-moving parties, were to be taken as true when deciding whether to grant summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court accepted defendant's guilty plea to burglary and attempted unlawful deviate conduct. Defendant was sentenced and was committed to a department of corrections. Defendant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief.

Defendant then filed a motion to bar application of the Act in his post-conviction proceeding. Defendant's motion was denied and an order of interlocutory appeal by defendant was certified. The issue on appeal was whether the superior court judge should have applied the later-enacted act or the law that was in effect at the time the guilty plea was accepted. On appeal, the court remanded and ordered the trial court to apply Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant and his accomplice were in a juvenile corrections institution, defendant asked the accomplice whether he knew anyone who had a lot of guns and nice things in his house. The accomplice told defendant about the victim's house. Later, defendant and the accomplice went to the victim's house and asked to see the son of the victim's fiancee. When the victim responded that the son no longer lived in the home, defendant pulled out a shotgun. The victim tried to slam the door shut, but defendant managed to fire two shots. The victim received injuries to his right hand and left shoulder. Defendant was convicted of attempted robbery and sentenced to 30 years. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession. The court reasoned that the totality of independent evidence presented by the state established the corpus delicti of attempted robbery. Further, defendant's waiver of his rights and confession were voluntary because the police were not required to inform defendant of the penal consequences or the specificity of the charges. The court concluded that defendant's sentence was not manifestly unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err by admitting defendant's two custodial statements into evidence. Defendant's statements were voluntary. The waiver form presented to him did not indicate that he could be provided with counsel only during court hearings. The trial court did not err in failing to give a jury instruction concerning attempted voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense because defendant did not tender an instruction in writing. The trial court did not err in giving a jury instruction on the defense of voluntary intoxication based on Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-3-5, even though that statute was later declared unconstitutional, because the issue of defendant's intoxication was never offered as a defense. A new trial was not required even though the trial judge, after instructing the jury, left the proceedings in charge of a judge pro tempore.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought direct review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Howard County (Indiana) convicting him of two counts of intentional murder and one count of burglary, and imposing the death sentence. Defendant presented 18 issues for review, including the insufficiency of the evidence, the denial of his request for a second voir dire of the jury before sentencing, and the admissibility of certain evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's bodyguard testified that he drove with defendant to the victims' trailer home and that he saw defendant enter the trailer with his &quot;super .38&quot; gun in hand. On appeal, the court rejected all defendant's arguments and affirmed his convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The court held that there was substantial evidence of probative value to support the judgment and that Indiana's statute requiring a jury to find the existence of aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt while weighing mitigating circumstances satisfied all requirements for written findings announced by the U.S. Supreme Court. Further, the court ruled that voir dire had been conducted appropriately. The court concluded that the prosecutor had not injected his personal opinion as to why the death penalty was proper and that Indiana's capital punishment scheme was constitutional despite the fact that it gave the state discretion in charging the death penalty. Finally, the court held that it had been proper for the trial court to have used the exact language of Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 when charging the jury on aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Marion Superior Court, Criminal Division Two (Indiana), which convicted him of burglary, criminal deviate conduct, confinement, rape, and habitual offender. Defendant received consecutive sentences for the burglary and criminal deviate conduct and concurrent sentences for the confinement and rape. Defendant's habitual offender sentence was consecutive to the sentences in the first two counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the victim's home, threatened her with a gun, repeatedly assaulted her, and confined her husband. On appeal, defendant alleged insufficient evidence, excessive sentence, and prosecutorial misconduct. The court affirmed defendant's convictions but remanded for the trial court to either enter findings to support the consecutive sentences or resentence defendant to concurrent terms. The trial court also had to correct the sentencing order to show which underlying felony was to be enhanced by the habitual offender status. There was substantial evidence to support the jury's determination that defendant was the assailant. The victim gave consistent detailed descriptions, she picked defendant's photo out of a photographic array, and two neighbors described the man they saw enter and leave the victim's house. The 70-year sentence was within statutory limits, and it was neither atrocious nor excessive in relation to the crimes. The prosecutor's improper questions did not entitle defendant to a mistrial because the trial court took curative measures, and defendant neither moved for a mistrial nor showed he was in the grave peril.</SPAN></P>

It also gave him a habitual offender determination and sentenced him to 140 years. He claimed that he was being punished twice for the same offense and that it was error to rule that he could not challenge the constitutional invalidity of a predicate felony conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into a house, held a knife against one victim and threatened to rape her, held her in a headlock, and dragged her into the second victim's room, where he tied their wrists together and threatened to rape both of them. Neighbors called the police, who knocked a door open and found defendant holding both victims in headlocks. At trial, his motion for a change of venue because of adverse publicity was denied. On review, the court found that the trial judge asked prospective jurors whether they heard anything of the case, and they indicated that they had not formed opinions. The court found that the elements of the crimes of criminal confinement, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-42-3-3(a)(1) (1985), and attempted rape, Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-42-4-1, 35-41-5-1, were different and that defendant could be sentenced for both offenses; that he could challenged the predicate felony convictions pursuant to Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner sought review of a judgment of the Vanderburgh County Circuit Court (Indiana), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief, subsequent to his conviction for dealing cocaine and the imposition of a 30-year prison sentence. The petitioner argued that the trial court erred in denying his petition alleging that his sentence was erroneous as violative of state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for post-conviction relief alleged that the petitioner's sentence was erroneous and constitutionally infirm because it far exceeded sentences imposed in other jurisdictions for similar offenses. The State admitted the allegations of the petition, and stipulated that the petition should be granted and a new judgment entered convicting defendant of a lesser felony, and imposing a six-year prison sentence. After a pretrial conference, the trial court denied the petition, finding, inter alia, that it was barred by res judicata. On appeal, the court held that because the precise issue raised in the petition was presented to the court and determined adversely to the petitioner in his direct appeal, the issue was not reviewable in a subsequent post-conviction proceeding. The court held that not only was the trial court not required to modify the sentence, it was not empowered to do so. Finally, the court held that the petitioner could have sought review of his sentence pursuant to the Rules for the Appellate Review of Sentences in his direct appeal, but was precluded from raising the issue for the first time in his petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of criminal deviate conduct, three counts of rape, and three counts of robbery. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting the victims' in-court identifications of defendant and the testimony concerning their out-of-court identifications over defendant's objection alleging unduly suggestive identification procedures. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of defendant's flight after an allegedly improper investigatory stop. The trial court's judgment of conviction against defendant was affirmed. The court held that the victims' identifications of defendant were not improperly admitted because each testified that during the crime she observed defendant closely under adequate light over a period of several hours. Thus, their testimony was based on observations independent of the pretrial procedure. Further, the error of admitting evidence of defendant's flight was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Marion Superior Court, Criminal Division I (Indiana), which convicted him of attempted murder, a class A felony, and robbery, a class B felony. Among other contentions of error, he contended that the State failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, either of the elements of attempted murder, and that the attempt statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-5-1 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accosted a store's manager as she walked across a bank parking lot. Declaring that he had a gun, he forced her to relinquish her bank deposit bag. Two men heard her scream and, when one man followed defendant, defendant stopped, extended his arm and shot in the man's direction. Defendant then surrendered to approaching security guards. On appeal, the court held that it was not error to deny defendant's motion for a change of judge without a hearing because his oral objection did not state any grounds other than his desire to have the presiding judge hear his case. Because his motion for continuance, on grounds he needed more time to prepare, did not conform to the requirements of Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-71-1, it was properly denied. The State proved both elements of the offense of attempted murder. Shooting the gun in the pursuer's direction showed both intent and a substantial step toward commission of the crime. Even if he had properly preserved a claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, the claim had to fail because it was readily apparent that a person of ordinary intelligence could understand that his conduct was intended to be proscribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to four charges of homicide. Under the agreement, defendant received two life sentences, one for first and one for second-degree murder, and two indeterminate 15-25 year sentences for the second-degree murder charges. Defendant moved for post-conviction relief and appealed when the motion was denied, arguing that his pleas were not voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly given because the trial court did not advise him as to the statutory maximum and/or minimum sentence allowed by statute. The court affirmed. The court noted that at the time of defendant's sentencing on the first-degree murder charge, Indiana had no death penalty and the sole penalty for first-degree murder was life imprisonment. The court stated that with respect to second-degree murder, a trial court could impose a life sentence or an indeterminate 15-25 year sentence. The court noted that the very nature of defendant's plea agreement outlined for defendant the possible range of sentences, concluding that defendant was cognizant of the limits within which he could be sentenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of the Allen Superior Court (Indiana), which granted defendants' motions to dismiss pursuant to Ind. Code &sect;35-3.1-1-4. The appeal was a consolidation of two direct appeals. Defendants were charged with neglect of a dependent, a class D felony, pursuant to &sect; 35-46-1-4 (a)(1). The trial court agreed with defendants that the &sect; 35-46-1-4 (a)(1) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed defendants' indictments and held that &sect; 35-46-1-4(a)(1) was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the burden was upon defendants to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. Defendants argued that the words &quot;may endanger&quot; were vague. The court held that the statute literally proscribed placements that exposed a dependent to a risk of harm. The court held that when the statute was construed literally, it was unconstitutionally broad and vague because persons of common intelligence were left to guess about the statute's meaning and would differ as to its application. The court held that it was permitted to give the statute a narrowing construction to save it from nullification so long as the construction did not establish a new or different policy basis and was consistent with legislative intent. The court construed the statute as applying to situations that endangered the life or health of a dependent. The court held that the placement must have exposed the dependent to a danger, which was actual and appreciable. The court held that the residual vagueness did not violate minimal due process notice requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness. The court remanded.</SPAN></P>

In response, the state officials argued that the trial court erred in considering the issue because the individuals were prosecuting a concurrent substantive medical malpractice claim on the merits. The court first noted that a declaratory judgment likely would not have been proper given the fact that the issue of the act's constitutionality was raised in both claims, and the action at bar could not resolve the medical malpractice damage claims. In any event, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the trial court erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on prior case law upholding the constitutionality of the act and found that the legislature's passage of the act was reasonably related to resolve the compelling state interest in resolving problems in the prosecution of medical malpractice suits. The court then held that the individuals had not shown the delay in the prosecution of their malpractice claims was unreasonable in light of the compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction and further determined that, because there was substantial evidence of probative value to support the conclusion of the trier of fact, the judgment would not be overturned. The court found that defendant's due process rights were not violated at the lineup procedure because there was little likelihood of misidentification resulting from impermissibly suggestive identification procedures. Pursuant to Ind.

The court noted that attempted robbery was a crime against a person and concluded that the trial court correctly instructed the jury.</SPAN></P>

When defendant pulled out a knife, the victim grabbed for it to protect herself. A physical struggle ensued and defendant stabbed the victim. Defendant was convicted of criminal recklessness and appealed. The State filed a petition to transfer the case when the lower court entered an opinion reversing his conviction. The court granted the petition and affirmed the trial court's decisions. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to the trial court's denial of his motion for a continuance because defense counsel was adequately prepared for trial. The court rejected defendant's argument that he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his right to a jury trial because he was under the mistaken belief that the regular trial judge would preside over his case. Defendant recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally performed the act of pulling out a knife while trying to discuss reconciliation with his ex-girlfriend, which created a risk and, in fact, resulted in bodily injury to the victim. There was sufficient evidence to sustain the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1982, construction bonds were issued to finance a convention center addition. The construction bonds were to be repaid by an account funded by excise tax revenues and convention center operating revenues. To respond to lowering interest rates, the CIB passed a resolution authorizing a new bond series to refinance the 1982 bonds. The auditor refused to sign the resolution on the basis that the bonds would place the county over the two percent debt limitation of Ind. Const. art. 13, &sect; 1. The CIB brought an action to mandate the auditor to attest to the seal. The trial court ordered the auditor to comply. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that, from the plain meaning of art. 13, &sect; 1, it was clear that a local governmental unit could not incur total indebtedness exceeding two percent of the value of the taxable property within its boundaries. Further, the &quot;special fund&quot; exception to the limitation only applied if the bonds were payable solely from operating revenues. Finally, a &quot;special taxing district&quot; was not created because the excise tax was not against the district's general property nor was it assessed against all parties benefiting from the convention center.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of his rape conviction, defendant argued that the State failed to prove the element of penetration because the victim talked in general terms about being &quot;raped&quot; and did not specifically describe any penetration. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court found that the victim used the term &quot;intercourse&quot; and stated that defendant &quot;entered&quot; her. In addition, laboratory tests showed the presence of semen in the victim's vagina. The court held that the trial court properly excluded evidence of the victim's sexual activity with her boyfriend earlier in the day because police found the victim nude and crying in defendant's car. She told police that she had been raped. The court held that evidence of the victim's consensual sexual activity with her boyfriend earlier that day would have had little probative value and was highly prejudicial. The court held that defendant's long sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment because the victim was a defenseless girl who was repeatedly raped.

The court determined that the sentence imposed by the trial court was within the statutory bounds and was not manifestly unreasonable. The court also determined that the jury instructions were not fatally incomplete because they lacked a reference to the burden of proof for a finding that defendant was mentally ill.

The issues were whether the State proved the element of &quot;hijacking&quot; within the meaning of the kidnapping statute and whether the State proved the element of &quot;fear&quot; within the meaning of the robbery statute. The court affirmed. The court determined that the legislature had not intended to restrict kidnapping to those situations in which the vehicle was transporting goods. The State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant and his accomplice took control of the victim's car by threatening him with a shotgun in order to take the victim to a bank so that they could force him to withdraw funds with his bank card. Such was sufficient to prove the element of &quot;hijacking a vehicle.&quot; The victim did not testify that he was actually put in fear, but it was well established that it was not necessary for the victim to testify as such. The court concluded that there was evidence from which a jury could reasonably have based a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was put in fear and the State, therefore, upheld its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in post-conviction proceedings the burden was on the inmate to establish grounds for relief by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found that the inmate did not raise the issue of his appearance in leg shackles in his direct appeal or in his petition for post-conviction relief and raised the issue for the first time in his brief on appeal. The court found the trial court was concerned about the inmate's possible disruption of the proceedings and that he was sitting when the prospective jury members came in. The court held that the inmate's appearance in leg shackles was not such a blatant error that it was fundamental error that may have been raised at any time. The court found that the inmate was not forced to appear pro se and that he expressly stated he did not want counsel.

I, &sect; 18, which provides that the penal code shall be founded on the principles of reformation, and not of vindictive justice. The trial court did not err in submitting the question of sentencing recommendations to the same jury that heard the guilt phase of the trial. Defendant was not prejudiced by the extensive pretrial publicity regarding his case because most of the jurors who had heard of the case stated that they could lay aside any opinion and render a verdict only on the evidence presented. The six who expressed an inability to render an impartial verdict were properly excused. Defendant's assertion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel was primarily grounded in his counsel's strategies at trial.

On appeal, defendant argued that the bill of information failed to allege he possessed the intent to kill, an essential element of the charge.

Code &sect; 35-41-3-5(b). The court affirmed the verdict. The court held &sect; 35-41-3-5(b) was ineffectual because it tried to limit the use of the voluntary intoxication circumstance to specific situations when such a factor was available as a defense at any time. The court found that while defendant had been drinking, sufficient evidence, such as the fact that he drove a car, was introduced to demonstrate that he was capable of possessing the intent to commit the act of attempted murder, thus the voluntary intoxication assertion had no impact upon his mens rea.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in the jury selection process or voir dire, as jurors were appropriately excluded for cause if they were unwilling to consider all possible penalties, particularly the death penalty. Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 did not permit automatic recommendation of death as it required aggravating circumstances to outweigh any mitigating circumstances. The information charging felony murder was not defective. The murder weapon was properly admitted because defendant had no right to object to a search of another person's apartment, where the weapon was found, and that person gave voluntary consent to search. The prosecution voluntarily disclosed an agreement made with a witness, which reduced the witness' sentence in exchange for his cooperation. The jury instructions were not erroneous. Defendant waived his claim of prosecutorial misconduct as he failed to object at trial. The trial court's findings that aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors were not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended his tape-recorded confession was improperly admitted under Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-7-3 (1980 Repl.) Under the statute, only an attorney or custodial parent could waive the child's rights. The waiver form was only signed by defendant's father as a witness. According to the police, the interview stopped as soon as defendant asked for an attorney and only resumed when defendant's father, after consulting with defendant, suggested it resume. Defendant's rights were then read to him again. The court found the evidence on this issue was conflicting. However, only that evidence which tended to support the trial court's ruling could be considered on appeal. The court could not weigh the evidence nor judge the credibility of witnesses. As there was substantial evidence of probative value to support the trial court's decision that the statements were given in compliance with Miranda, the court could not disturb the ruling. Thus, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress or in allowing the tape-recorded statements into evidence. The conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in various respects concerning the admissibility of evidence presented during his trial. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erroneously denied his right to a speedy trial and that the preliminary charge statute was unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's arguments. The court noted that defendant waived his right to challenge the admissibility of a statement he made to the victim's mother at the jail by failing to object at trial. The court found that defendant had also failed to preserve his claim that his speedy trial right had been denied by failing to raise the issue in the trial court. The court also noted that Ind. Code &sect; 35-4-1-1 (1979) properly allowed defendant to be held for a period of seven days before formal charges were filed. Further, any error in refusing to limit cross-examination of a State's witness was harmless, as her testimony was cumulative. Finally, the trial court's exclusion of a defense witness's testimony was not error as defendant had failed to preserve this issue for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens brought their action against the county council seeking redress under the Indiana Open Door Law Act (act), Ind. Code &sect; 5-14-1.5-1 et seq. The controversy arose from the proposed construction of a building that would house a new jail and county courts and offices. The citizens alleged that a meeting was held in violation of the act because there was no proper notice of the date, time, place, and agenda of the meeting. The trial court determined that the matter was a public lawsuit and ordered the citizens to post a bond in order to continue the matter. On appeal of the dismissal of the complaint, the court held that the trial court properly concluded that the matter was a public lawsuit because the citizens did not seek remedies regarding their personal or property rights, and the action attacked the alleged failure of the public body to comply with the act. Also, the citizens had not carried their burden of showing by sufficient evidence that their claim was a substantial one that would entitle them to a temporary injunction. Therefore, the citizens were justifiably required to post a bond or suffer dismissal of their complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The target witness sought review of a decision finding him in direct contempt and challenged the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-2-8, as it applied to target witnesses. On appeal, the target witness contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court's finding of direct contempt. The court affirmed the trial court's decision finding the target witness in direct contempt. The court determined that under Indiana's statutes, if a grand jury witness refused to testify, invoking his privilege against self-incrimination, the trial judge could grant use immunity and derivative use immunity to the witness. The witness could then be compelled to testify, and if he refused he could be found in contempt -- which was precisely what took place in the instant action. Also, statutes that compelled the testimony of target witnesses in exchange for both use immunity and derivative use immunity were constitutional, even when they allowed subsequent perjury prosecutions arising from false immunized testimony. The court concluded that Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-2-8 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V, nor Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the lower court erred in denying the inmate relief under the doctrine of laches on the basis that eight years had passed since the claim for relief first became available to him. However, the court held that in light of the determination that the inmate waived the issue of the trial court's jurisdiction over his person, the denial of relief was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 16 at the time, raped a female victim and stabbed her several times. At trial, the jury was not instructed in the proper scienter, specific intent, when it deliberated and rendered a decision. In reversing the conviction, the court found that the instructions failed to include an essential element of the offense, namely, that defendant must have had the specific intent to commit murder in order to be found guilty of attempted murder. The court held that the error was fundamental and, if not rectified, would deny defendant fundamental due process. Further, the court found that the juvenile court judge properly waived jurisdiction of the proceedings under Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-2-4(d). The court held that the statute's language &quot;the child's welfare and the best interests of the state&quot; was a sufficient guideline that saved the statute from being void on its face for vagueness. Although the original information failed to include the words &quot;with the intent to kill,&quot; the juvenile judge heard enough evidence about the bloody crime to make an enlightened determination regarding waiver from the juvenile system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a bank and a bankers association, challenged a decision from the Porter Superior Court (Indiana), which entered judgment in favor of appellees, the State Board of Finance of Indiana, related State officials, and a savings and loan association. Appellants had sought a declaratory judgment that Pub. L. No. 15-1980 (Ind.) was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge held that a deposit of public funds in savings associations did not result in the State becoming a stockholder of a corporation or association within the meaning of Ind. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12. The trial judge also held that a savings association did not have to qualify as a depository under the Depository Act of 1937. The court granted transfer pursuant to Ind. R. App. P. 4(A)(10), since there was a substantial question of law of great public importance. The court also held that the Act did not violate the spirit or the letter of that portion of Ind. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12, which prohibited the State from being a stockholder in a corporation. The State was authorized to deposit money in savings associations up to the amount insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Finally, the State was allowed to deposit public funds in savings associations even though they were not depositories under the Depository Act of 1937 because to find otherwise would have defeated the intent of the legislature to liberalize the power of state and local government to invest public funds.</SPAN></P>

Over the course of three years, defendant engaged in deviant sexual conduct with the daughter. The daughter informed her relatives.

Defendant was charged with engaging in sexual intercourse and deviate sexual conduct with the daughter. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge that he engaged in sexual intercourse with the daughter. The trial court reserved its ruling and submitted the charge to the jury. A jury convicted defendant only on the deviate sexual conduct charge. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to change venue. The court reasoned that defendant failed to show that he was harmed by newspaper articles about a prior arrest. The court also found no error in denying defendant's motion to dismiss. Further, allowing an employee of the center refresh her memory with her notes did not require a finding as to the propriety of the release of medical records pursuant to Ind.

The court noted that defendant had been located after the escape and that prior to trial the State amended its information and charged defendant with being a habitual offender. Furthermore, defendant failed to object to the amended information. The court found that the State submitted court docket sheets and certified copies of prison records that properly authenticated defendant's prior felonies. The court reasoned that even though the State improperly submitted one of the prior felonies, there was sufficient evidence of three prior, unrelated felonies. Defendant also argued that the orders regarding the prior convictions were not properly authenticated because they were signed by the prison's keeper of records and not the clerks of the courts. The court found that certified copies of prison records were admissible as public records and could be used to establish prior felony convictions.

The court found that the jury did not hear defendant admit any of the past convictions. The court concluded that the State could use prior convictions on cross-examination for impeachment purposes. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it refused to admit into evidence the victim's letters to defendant while he was serving a prior prison sentence. The court found that the letters failed to show that the victim had a motive to exaggerate or lie. Therefore, there was no error in denying the letters. Finally, during deliberations the jurors asked the trial court for the definition of rape, and the trial court sent the jurors the written jury instructions. The trial court had read the instructions to the jury prior to deliberations. The court concluded that the trial court's error in giving the jury the instructions was harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient in that there was no evidence that he was over 16 years of age at the time of the alleged offense, age being an element at that point in time of the offense of armed robbery. The court held that age was an element of armed robbery under Ind. Code &sect; 35-12-1-1 (1975), however it was peculiar, discrete, and remote from the actions constituting the offense and as such proof of it was not essential to conviction unless defendant first filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss denying the requisite age. The court held that age did not become an issue to be resolved by the trier of fact or the court on appeal, unless the required motion to dismiss was directed to the trial judge. Defendant did not file a motion to dismiss on that basis. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in ruling that he had not been deprived of his right to trial by jury through the exercise by the prosecution of a peremptory challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen walking in the area of the victims' property, around the time of the murders, by a deputy sheriff.

On appeal, defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial. The court affirmed the convictions and death sentence. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his inculpatory statement because the statement was voluntary. The court also held that defendant had effective assistance of counsel because the record showed that defendant had vigorous representation in the face of overwhelming evidence, including his own confession, against him. The court finally held that Indiana's death penalty statute was constitutional and that the trial court followed the proper procedures for imposing the death penalty. The court concluded that the aggravating circumstances of intentionally killing while committing a burglary and the two killings outweighed the mitigating factor of no prior criminal history.</SPAN></P>

The court held that material requested as a part of the trial court's discovery order did not fall within the work product doctrine. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his statements made to police because his Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights were not violated where the statements were made voluntarily and with the consent of defendant and his mother.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness saw two unmasked men unloading items from a store. The witness was shown photographs of two suspects, who were later charged with the burglary and theft. Defendant's first trial for burglary and theft resulted in a mistrial based on the photographic viewing. At a second trial, the state charged defendant with being an habitual offender. On appeal, the court ruled that defendant's motion to suppress the witness's in-court identification was properly denied because the witness was able to make an independent identification of defendant when he saw him taking goods from the store. The court ruled, however, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the habitual offender charge. The court ruled that because the state was previously unable to prove that charge before the first trial, yet still proceeded to trial, the state chose to forego its right to seek the enhanced penalty. The court held that the state, therefore, could not bring the habitual offender charge to coerce defendant into foregoing his right to a fair trial or wield it thereafter to punish him for not having done so. The court affirmed in part, and reversed the habitual offender conviction.</SPAN></P>

The jury recommended the death sentence for the felony murder count, and defendant was sentenced to four 20 year terms of imprisonment and one 50 year term, all to run consecutively, and death. His direct appeal challenged the legality of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed by the court. The court found that the record showed that the trial court was not acting with bias or prejudice against defendant when it rejected defendant's guilty plea, but was concerned with affording the proper credibility and respect to the death penalty statute. The court found no abuse of discretion in the rejection of the guilty plea since it was within the trial court's discretion to reject the plea. The totality of the questioning established that five jurors were irrevocably committed to vote against the death penalty. The court found that the Indiana death sentencing procedures were consistent with and in full compliance with the requirements set forth by the United States Supreme Court. The court found that all of the statutory procedures were followed in the trial and sentencing of defendant. The court found ample evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that defendant intentionally killed the victim while committing a robbery. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of a change of venue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of robbery and of being an habitual offender. On appeal he argued, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The court affirmed the judgment. A robbery conviction may have been sustained on the uncorroborated testimony of one eyewitness. In the case at hand, three witnesses positively identified defendant as the man whom they had seen with the victim's purse. Additionally, when arrested defendant had the exact amount of money in his pocket as was taken from the victim's purse. Hence, strong circumstantial evidence connected defendant with the crime. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a codefendant forced a victim at knifepoint to perform fellatio on them. Defendant argued that his silence in response to his codefendant's suggestion to take the victim out to the country was not evidence of his agreement to commit a felony. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that although the statement alone was not adequate proof of a conspiracy, the conspiracy was proved by their actions of luring the victim to a remote location and sexually assaulting him. That the assault was completed as a joint effort further suggested the existence of a conspiracy. There was evidence that defendant and his codefendant enticed the victim, who was mentally slow, to accompany them from a bar on the pretext of a joyride. The court concluded that, based upon the evidence, the criminal transaction commenced in the county of the trial court's jurisdiction, where the conspiracy was fomented, and ended in another county, where the assault occurred. Thus, under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-1.1-2-1(d) (1979) the county where the conspiracy was completed was a proper venue for all the charges. All other assignments of error were overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon undisputed evidence adduced at trial that showed that the substance delivered by a defendant to a confidential informant at the other defendant's instruction, a jury found defendants guilty of dealing in cocaine, Ind.

The trial court sentenced each to a term of 30 years, based upon the statute's classification that the offense was a class A felony if the amount of the drug involved weighed three grams or more. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentences as class A felonies, rejecting defendants' argument that the classification should be based upon the actual weight of pure cocaine delivered. The court further held that a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated when his conversations with a government informant were electronically monitored by a government agent with the consent of the informant and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the State's witness was qualified to give expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

Police discovered the victim's watch, cigarette lighter, and cigarette case inside codefendant's pocket. Defendants were convicted for burglary. At separate interviews with probation officers charged with the preparation of pre-sentence reports, defendants both claimed that they were innocent of wrongdoing and were helping the victim move belongings to his mother's house. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions and 12-year prison sentences by finding that, as defendants voluntarily and freely choose to share their versions of the criminal event with the probation officers, the use of defendants' statements to the probation officers by the superior court judge for sentencing purposes did not violate their Miranda rights. Defendants' sentences, which were within the four-year to 20-year sentencing range for burglary, were constitutionally proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court acknowledged that Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-4-3 required the trial court to make a statement of the court's reasons for selecting the sentence it imposed. Here, the trial court recounted on the record its finding that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances, and then listed defendant's several prior convictions. The trial court also noted that defendant had engaged in criminal activity in a continual fashion since he was a teenager. The trial court did not, however, particularize any mitigating circumstances. Affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court found that the record statement of reasons for aggravation was minimally sufficient, and that the enhancement of the basic sentence imposed by the trial court was not manifestly unreasonable. The court declined to accept defendant's assertion that, given the value of the items taken, the sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that the sentence was not barbaric or grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, the forcible entry of a private residence, and, thus, met the standard imposed by the Eighth Amendment and its Indiana counterpart.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Gibson Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted defendant of attempted burglary. Defendant argued that the trial court committed fundamental error in allowing a witness whose name was not endorsed upon the information to testify at trial and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding that defendant was the perpetrator of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also argued that the sentencing criteria for enhancement by reason of aggravating circumstances under Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-4-7(c) was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. On appeal, the court disagreed. First, there was no error in allowing the witness to testify because he lived at the address listed in the information, was also known by the name used therein, and because defendant did not claim that he was misled or surprised by the discrepancy. As to the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant acknowledged that he was near the scene of the crime shortly after its occurrence and that he had a hammer which could have broken the window involved. Contrary to defendant's claim, his presence near the scene with the hammer coupled with conclusive evidence of his contemporaneous flight from police established a consciousness of guilt which supported a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, defendant's constitutional claim failed because the term &quot;prior criminal history&quot; as used in &sect; 35-4.1-4-7(c) was adequately specific to apprise a competent accused that the trial court could consider a prior felony conviction as a factor favoring an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners operated junkyards at their residences. Thereafter, the counties in which the property owners lived passed zoning ordinances prohibiting junkyards within their districts. The ordinances contained amortization provisions requiring the discontinuance of pre-existing lawful nonconforming uses of real estate upon the expiration of a specific number of years. Appellee planning commissions brought separate actions against the property owners for violating the ordinances, and injunctions were issued against them. The property owners filed motions for relief from their respective judgments, which were denied. The property owners appealed and filed petitions seeking transfer from the appellate court. On appeal, the court granted the petitions to transfer, vacated the appellate court's opinion, and reversed the trial court's judgments. The court held that regardless of the length of time given to amortize the nonconforming use, the ordinances constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law and an unreasonable exercise of police power because they prohibited any continuation of the property owners' pre-existing lawful use of their real estate.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 31-6-2-4 (Repl. 1980), defendant, who was a tenth grade student at the time of the fire, was waived from juvenile court and tried as an adult.

Over her objection, this witness testified to her statements at her trial, but was not permitted to say it was part of a polygraph test. Affirming the conviction, the court held (1) defendant waived the attorney-client privilege by having the witness testify at the waiver hearing, (2) the felony murder statute was constitutional and only an intent to commit the underlying felony was required, (3) Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-7-6 (Repl. 1980) did not require dismissal of the charges because the waiver hearing was not held within 20 days of the filing of the delinquency petition, (4) the trial court properly kept a juror after questioning her about a &quot;double hearsay&quot; report of misconduct, (5) it was harmless error to have admitted the death certificate because it gave the cause of death as &quot;house fire started by arsonist,&quot; and (6) testimony of defendant's low mental capacity was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty of the thefts offenses and also found defendant to be a habitual offender.

Defendant claimed on appeal that the habitual offender statute, Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-02-8(e) did not establish a separate offense in and of itself. The court agreed with defendant's claim. The court ruled that &sect; 35-5-02-8(e) provided for an enhancement of a sentence for an underlying felony of which defendant had to be convicted in order to invoke the operation of the statute but that application of the statute as creating a separate offense would have constituted a violation of the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He filed a petition for habeas corpus relief, which was denied by the trial court. He filed a motion to correct errors, which was also denied. He challenged the decision, alleging that it was unconstitutional to deny him good time credits as provided by Ind. Code &sect; 11-1-1-9.1(a) even though he was serving a term of life imprisonment. In affirming the decision, the court found that defendant failed to state a cause of action. The court held that defendant's petition could not lie for a writ of habeas corpus because the court did not have jurisdiction to address the petition unless he alleged that he was seeking immediate discharge, which he did not. The petition could not lie for post-conviction relief because the relief he sought was prospective in nature. Nevertheless, the court addressed the issues so as to discourage defendant from further futility. The court found that &sect; 11-1-1-9.1(a) never mandated good time credit to any group, and it did not convert his life sentence to an indeterminate term of 20 years to life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary, theft, receiving stolen property, and being a habitual criminal offender. He was found guilty of receiving stolen property and of being a habitual criminal offender. He claimed that: (1) his acquittal on the theft charge necessitated an acquittal on the receiving stolen property charge; (2) the 30-year sentence was disproportionate to the offenses; and (3) the trial court erred in refusing his request to charge on the habitual offender statute. In affirming the judgment, the court found that it already decided the sentencing and refusal to charge issues contrary to defendant's positions. Defendant's acquittal on the burglary and theft charges did not necessitate an acquittal on the receiving stolen property charge because a person could be guilty of receiving property which had previously been the subject of a theft, even though that person did not commit the theft.

He contended that it was reversible error to allege more than two felonies under &sect; 35-50-2-8, to deny his motion to dismiss the &sect; 35-50-2-8 count, and to admit certain exhibits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant agreed to go to a police station to answer questions about the burglary of a hair salon. Later, he gave a statement admitting that he had been involved in the burglary. He sought to suppress this statement, claiming that it was not knowingly or voluntarily given. The court affirmed the judgment. Suppression was properly denied because he admitted at a hearing that he had not been under arrest or forced to sign or say anything, and because nothing showed illegal detainment. The exhibit of a &quot;permission to search&quot; that he had executed for his home was properly admitted when he had not objected. The exhibit of a &quot;waiver of rights&quot; form he signed was properly admitted when he had been advised of his Miranda rights by an officer, and when defendant admitted that his constitutional rights were read to him before questioning began. It was proper to deny his motion to dismiss because he abandoned the speedy trial issue by moving for a continuance beyond the seventy-day period in Ind. R. Crim. P. 4(B)(1).

At trial, the victim's husband testified on cross-examination that to his knowledge the victim had never concealed from him any information regarding their relationship. Thereafter, when defendant attempted to question the victim about her faithfulness to her husband, the trial court enforced the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-32.5-1 (1979), by prohibiting any such questioning. After his conviction, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in applying the statute because the husband's testimony placed the victim's character in evidence. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in applying the statute. The court noted that the husband's testimony was made in response to defendant's cross-examination. The court determined that the State did not open the door and did not in any way place the victim's character in evidence. The court stated that the victim's testimony never put her credibility in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a claim with the board that alleged that his permanent disability was due to his work-related exposure to asbestos. The board found that the employee's disability had not arisen within three years of the date of his last job-related exposure and was not compensable. The court of appeals found the statute of limitations unconstitutional and reversed the board. On petition for transfer, the court found the court of appeals in error, vacated their opinion, and affirmed the board. The court held that the facts clearly indicated that the employee's asbestos-related disability arose after the expiration of the statutory period within which all asbestos-related disability claims must have been brought. The employee sought to avoid the direct application of the three-year limitation period and to circumvent a foreclosure of his claim by arguing that it would abridge his constitutional right to a remedy to say that the time for claiming the remedy had passed even before it accrued. The court held that in questioning the wisdom of the legislature, the court of appeals in effect rewrote the law thereby usurping the legislature's constitutionally mandated function.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the verdict was contrary to law in that the evidence established that he was insane at the time of the offenses. He asserted that the State bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he was sane at the time of the offenses. On appeal, the court held that the burden of proving insanity was given to the person interposing the defense. The court noted that there was contradictory evidence existing as to whether defendant was sane at the time that he shot two victims. The court stated that the jury was entitled to consider both lay and expert testimony in assessing defendant's mental capacity at the time of the shootings. The court found that there was evidence to support the jury's factual determination. The court stated that the existence of a mental disease or deficiency did not ipso facto render a person legally insane.

The trial court also found appellant to be a habitual criminal. Appellant was sentenced to 2 years for forgery to be served concurrently with 1 year for attempted possession, and 30 years as a habitual criminal. Appellant sought review of his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant presented a prescription to the pharmacist for 25 four-milligram tablets of Dilaudid, a Schedule II narcotic controlled substance used for pain. At trial, the parties stipulated to a statement prepared by the doctor whose name was on the prescription that he had never treated the appellant, never prescribed Dilaudid because of its addictive qualities, and that he did not sign or authorize anyone else to sign the prescription form. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in admission of evidence, in charging the jury, in limiting cross-examination, and in sentencing appellant as a habitual offender. The court held that the trial court's only error was in the imposition of 30 years as a habitual offender as a separate sentence. The sentence was not a separate sentence, but was an enhanced sentence for the forgery. A separate sentence constituted double jeopardy and violated the U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The trial court properly refused to admit appellant's statement to the pharmacist. Because the statement was self-serving and deceptive, it was not res gestae. Admitting the statement would have permitted appellant to testify without being subject to cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the Transportation Act (Act), Ind. Code &sect; 8-9.5-4-1 et seq., was constitutional, and held it could not find the Act constitutional merely upon the existence of a special fund doctrine because to do so would have opened the floodgates of authorizing unlimited state indebtedness, thereby vitiating the very purpose of Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 5, and that if that was allowed, then the debt limitation of the Indiana Constitution was, for all practical purposes, nullified.

First, as to alleged error premised upon a failure to suppress his confession, defendant waived any theoretical error by testifying to substantially the same facts as those contained in his confession. Second, there was no error in overruling defendant's objection to the trial court's instruction as to the defense of duress as to the charge of attempted murder. Attempted murder was an offense against the person as defined in Ind. Code &sect; 35-42, and the defense of duress was expressly excluded. Third, as to sufficiency of the evidence, the jury was not obligated to believe defendant's testimony, nor, based upon the evidence, to find duress as a defense to the burglary charge.

In affirming, the court held that the test in Indiana did not require that defendant's action were to have been entirely &quot;unknowing&quot; to afford the defense of insanity. The court held that, although &quot;knowingly&quot; was an element necessary in the perpetration of a murder, the presence of that element did not negate the defense of insanity. Therefore the court ruled that &sect; 35-41-4-1(b) did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof of one of the elements to defendant but simply shifted the burden of establishing his affirmative defense of insanity.

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the trial court did not error by making an interim ruling that defendant was competent to stand trial where defendant filed a motion to determine competency only two weeks before trial and there was an unexpected absence of one psychiatrist. The court held defendant's motion for continuance that was filed on the day of trial was properly denied where defendant failed to show why he was unable, without due diligence, to obtain a psychiatric evaluation in the four months since his arrest. The court determined statements made to the police were not inadmissible on the basis that defendant was allegedly questioned after requesting an attorney where the testimony indicated that defendant understood his rights and wanted to make a statement without an attorney present. The court found defendant failed to show any deliberate attempt to exclude any group from jury selection.

Defendant appealed, claiming that he was apprised insufficiently of the habitual offender charge, that &sect; 35-50-2-8 was unconstitutional, and that his motion to overrule the State's motion in limine was improperly denied.</SPAN></P>

He claimed in part on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance to retain private counsel.

The court ordered a correction in defendant's sentence but otherwise upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that the trial court erred in assessing a separate sentence of 30 years against defendant as an habitual criminal. The 30 years provided by statute should have been an enhancement of one of the felonies. Second, the court held that defendant had no constitutional right to a private investigator at public expense. Further, by representing himself, defendant assumed the hazard of doing without the supplies and services an appointed attorney could have provided for him. Third, defendant was not denied a reasonable opportunity to obtain private counsel when he waited until five days before trial to exercise the right and had for eight months prior unequivocally waived the right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended the trial court erred by not granting him a continuance, by permitting his co-actors to testify against him, and by sentencing him under Indiana's Habitual Offender Statute, which he claimed was unconstitutional. Defendant also claimed the trial court erred by not instructing the jury as to the punishment for an habitual offender and that a prior felony for which he was convicted was reduced to a misdemeanor. Defendant also claimed there was insufficient evidence that he committed the burglary. The court determined that defendant failed to allege any factual basis for his continuance and he failed to show any prejudice from the denial of his request for a continuance. The court held that the Habitual Offender Statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8 (Supp. 1982), was not unconstitutional and the jury was not entitled to know the consequences of its finding that he was an habitual offender. The court also held that the prior offense was considered as of the date of the conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen in a clothing store on a prior occasion, and a suit that she had been looking at was discovered as missing.

The trial court allowed the store's manager to testify that he saw defendant in the store on a prior occasion. The State cross-examined defendant on her prior theft convictions. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant on the habitual criminal finding because Indiana's habitual criminal statute only allowed an enhancement of 30 years on an underlying crime; the court noted that the trial court likely intended simply to give defendant a 32 year sentence. The store manager properly testified to defendant's prior appearance in the store because the evidence showed defendant's identity and her common scheme in frequenting the store. The State was properly permitted to cross-examine defendant about her prior theft convictions because defense counsel asked her about the convictions on direct examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was sentenced to life imprisonment following his second-degree murder conviction. Following the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief, the inmate asserted that the trial court erroneously found no evidence that the inmate's trial counsel was ineffective, that the trial court erroneously denied a new trial because of newly discovered evidence, and that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the trial court here properly found there was not sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to the effectiveness of the inmate's counsel at his original trial because the record shows that the attorney actively represented the inmate at his trial. Additionally, the court held that the very nature of the newly discovered evidence, its tardiness, and the relationship of the witnesses to the inmate was understandably rejected by the trial court as a cause for a new trial. Likewise, the sentence was not cruel and unusual because there was no constitutional mandate of &quot;guidelines&quot; for use by the jury any time the sentencing function was undertaken.</SPAN></P>

The State contended that the trial court had, in effect, held Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-7-4 (1980) unconstitutional contrary to Indiana Const. art. 1, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to dismiss the information because it was filed in the form of a uniform traffic citation ticket and was defective under Ind. Code &sect; 35-3.1-1-4(1), (9) for the reason that the information did not state the offense with sufficient certainty and did not comply with Ind. Code &sect; 35-3.1-1-2 in that it failed to set forth the nature and elements of the offense in plain and concise language. The trial court had held that it did not agree with the allegation in the uniform traffic citation ticket, which complied with the requirements of Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-7-4 (1980), that defendant did unlawfully commit the following offense: driving while intoxicated. In dismissing the appeal, the court noted that defendant's motion to dismiss did not ask the trial court to declare any statute unconstitutional. The trial court did express concern about the possibility of prejudice to defendant if the traffic citation were read to the jury; but the expression of such concern did not rise to the level of a determination of unconstitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised the issues of whether the trial court erred in denying a motion for mistrial after evidence was introduced that the gun used by defendant was stolen, whether there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that defendant was sane at the time of the crime, whether evidence of defendant's expressed intent to kill the victim was properly allowed as rebuttal evidence, and whether defendant's constitutional rights were violated by requiring him to establish his defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. The court determined that the evidence that the gun was stolen did not amount to a direct allegation of a prior criminal act by defendant. The court explained that it would not have weighed the conflicting evidence heard by the jury because that would have been an invasion of the province of the jury. The court noted that there was sufficient evidence of defendant's sanity to support the verdict of the jury. The court concluded that the admissibility of rebuttal evidence was within the sound discretion of the trial court. The court determined that there was no constitutional problem in treating insanity as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 36-2-2-4 and Ind. Code &sect; 36-2-3-4. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction and declared sections of each statute relating to counties having more than two second-class cities unconstitutional as special laws. The court reversed on appeal. The fact that only one county fit in the category of counties having more than two second-class cities did not render the statutes unconstitutional. The terms did not prevent application of their provisions to any county that could eventually qualify. The presence of three large cities in the county could impair a locally elected body's capacity to restrict consideration of district boundaries to the statutory criteria. Removal of the redistricting function from the county executive to the state executive was one way of avoiding this effect. The legislature was within its authority to establish single-member districts within counties for certain elective positions, to classify counties for this purpose, and to take steps bearing a rational relationship to its goal.</SPAN></P>

When the police car stopped at the police station, defendant bolted from the car. He was later apprehended in another state. He was found guilty of burglary, theft, escape, and being a habitual offender and sentenced to 32 years in prison. The court affirmed the judgments. It found that the trial court did not err in giving an instruction on flight, as evidence of flight was relevant to show guilt on the escape charge and a consciousness of guilt on the burglary and theft charges. It also found that it was not error to refuse to give defendant's tendered instruction relating to the jury's duty to exercise their independent judgment in arriving at a verdict, as the trial court's instruction properly covered that area. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to support the burglary and theft convictions, as there was evidence of flight and the testimony of a witness to whom defendant confessed his involvement was not inherently unbelievable, even though he went to police because he believed defendant caused him to lose his job.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the case was a public lawsuit in which the citizens were indirectly questioning the validity of financing a public improvement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Administrator of the Indiana State Department of Public Welfare, members of the State Board of Public Welfare, and the Director of the Marion County Department of Public Welfare, sought review of a decision of the Hancock Circuit Court (Indiana), which found in favor of appellees, a mother representing herself, her children, and a class of individuals whose aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) benefits were cut.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the directive of the legislature to institute a rateable reduction, the board adopted regulation 2-106, effectuating a 25 percent rateable reduction in AFDC benefits. The implementation of the rateable reduction caused some AFDC recipients to be stricken from the welfare rolls and reduced benefits to some other recipients. The mother's benefits were reduced in amount because of the rateable reduction, and she brought an action in behalf of herself and her minor children, as well as all of those similarly situated. The trial court found that the action was properly maintainable as a class action. Further, the trial court found in favor of the mother and against defendants, on the grounds that the legislature failed to establish guidelines to guide the board in the selection of the amount of rateable reduction. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the legislature gave proper and sufficient guidelines to the state welfare department in its operations and the legislature did not unconstitutionally delegate its authority to the board by allowing the board to set the actual figure of rateable reduction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the cause to the trial court with orders to amend its judgment consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statutes were constitutionally valid and enforceable. On appeal by transfer, the court affirmed. The court found that the taxpayers failed to clearly show that the tax allocation financing statutes were unconstitutional. The court held that the expanded powers of the redevelopment commissions as special taxing districts did not create a separate municipal corporation or a city agency and did not change the city's original taxing power. The tax allocation bonds did not constitute debt in violation of the state constitution's debt limitation provision. The tax allocation financing plan did not violate the uniform and equal taxation requirements, did not violate due process and equal protection guarantees, and did not impair the contracts of the overlapping taxing districts.</SPAN></P>

A search of his car pursuant to a search warrant produced jewelry and burglary tools. The trial court convicted defendant for theft and found that he was a habitual criminal.

The court held that the record was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that defendant was not so intoxicated as to make his confession involuntary and was adequate to support the trial court's finding that the confession was not unduly influenced by any illegal tactics by the police officers. The court further held that testimony that the victim plainly observed defendant in her bedroom for approximately one minute in daylight and had the opportunity to view him later was sufficient to support the trial court's ruling that the in-court identification was not tainted. The court also held that the trial court did not err in allowing a police officer to describe his conversation with the victim immediately following the rape, and that the trial court's statement in pronouncing sentence was lacking in specificity to support the augmentation of the sentence as required by Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying the motion of his court appointed counsel to withdraw from the case. The court found that the right to counsel in a criminal proceeding did not mean defendant had an absolute right to be represented by counsel of his own choosing. In the case at bar, counsel stated his readiness to proceed with trial but was merely presenting his client's dissatisfaction with his representation. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to replace his counsel immediately before trial. Defendant next claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the identification testimony of the complaining witnesses because it was the product of an unduly suggestive pretrial identification procedure. The court held that although defendant moved to suppress this testimony prior to the time it was offered to the jury, the law clearly required an additional objection when the identification testimony was offered as evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a victim's home and attacked her with a knife from a kitchen shortly after she had gone to bed. The victim unequivocally identified defendant as the man who entered her home without her permission and thereafter used a knife to compel her to engage in vaginal and anal intercourse. The court held the evidence was sufficient to support the rape and burglary convictions. The information also charged defendant with criminal deviate conduct, a violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-4-2 (1979). The jury returned a verdict of not guilty. While the jury might have found from the evidence that defendant committed criminal deviate conduct, the court held that it was not required to do so. The State contended that the trial court erred in not sentencing defendant upon both charges. The State, however, made no claim of any action on its part that would have brought this asserted error to the attention of the trial court. Such action was a prerequisite to taking an appeal or to the State's seeking a writ of mandamus, which was the proper remedy for the State to use to challenge alleged sentencing errors.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then contended that that the evidence on the habitual offender allegation was inadmissible, that the State failed to establish a prima facie case that he was an habitual offender, and that the trial court erred in denying a directed verdict on the question, because the testimony and documentary evidence of his prior felony convictions did not adequately identify him as an habitual offender. The court found that a prior plea by defendant was properly admitted and did establish that defendant was a habitual offender. The court concluded that sentencing under the habitual offender scheme involved neither reprosecution for the same offense after acquittal, reprosecution for the same offense after conviction, nor multiple punishment for the same offense, which the double jeopardy clause prevented.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's claims of self defense and sudden heat upon sufficient provocation were rejected by the jury. The court held that the voluntary manslaughter statute did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof of sudden heat from the State to defendant because it only required him to place the affirmative defense in issue, while the State bore the ultimate burden of negating such defense. The court also held that defendant had no standing to challenge the legality of the search of his brother's house and the admission of evidence obtained therefrom because he did not live there and a person who did had consented to the search. The trial court did not improperly command the jury to consider defendant's flight, but merely instructed that it was a circumstance which could be considered. The trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant's tendered instructions because they were adequately covered by others. Although defendant's sentence was over the basic sentence, the court held that it was not excessive in light of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Several days later, defendant and another individual approached the victim while he was driving his truck. Defendant pulled out a pistol and fired a shot, which went through the victim's truck. A second shot hit the victim in the temple. The victim was permanently blind as a result. The victim's wife testified that she saw defendant with a gun and heard one shot being fired. She then saw defendant fire the second shot that struck the victim in the temple. Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The court affirmed. There was testimony by both the victim and his wife that defendant was the one who fired the pistol. The act of firing a loaded pistol at the victim's head was a substantial step towards murder. That act as well as the evidence of the previous assault supported the inference that there was a specific intent to kill the victim. Evidence of the prior altercation was admissible as proof of malice and intent to kill. Defendant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and was not manifestly unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-1-1-4 (1973) made it a misdemeanor for a state policeman to engage in political activity. In two separate cases, two state policemen were told that if they declared their candidacy for county sheriff they would be subject to the sanctions of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-1-1-6, which allowed the Superintendent of State Police to discharge, demote, or temporarily discipline a policeman who violated any law of the State or any regulation of the department. The trial court declared Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-1-1-4 to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's decree that &sect; 10-1-1-4 was unconstitutional needed to be vacated because one of the complaints named only one defendant, the Superintendent of State Police, and the Superintendent's powers did not extend to the initiation of criminal prosecutions.

Defendant also took the shop's cash box and its contents. As defendant fled, the owners of a neighboring shop viewed defendant and noted the make and license number of defendant's automobile. Those witnesses, as well as the victim, identified defendant at trial. After defendant was arrested, he was read his Miranda rights twice and informed of the charges against him. Defendant signed the waiver of rights form but refused to sign the statement he made. The officer then informed defendant of his Miranda rights again and defendant made corrections to his statement and signed a confession. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because defendant was charged with three offenses which were not the same and because each of the offenses required proof of facts not required by the other offenses, the trial court did not err by sentencing defendant to consecutive sentences. Further, defendant had no constitutional right to have his sentences run concurrently. Finally, defendant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The instructions told the jury that defendant had the burden of proving his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. On appeal, the court relied on precedent decided after the appeal was filed to hold that the shifting of the burden of proof on an insanity defense, in accordance with Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 35-41-4-1 (1978), did not violate defendant's due process rights and that the instructions were not erroneous. The court noted that the basic sentence for murder under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 35-50-2-3 (Repl. 1979) was 40 years and that under Ind. R. App. Rev. Sentences 2, the sentence would not be revised unless it was manifestly unreasonable in light of the nature of the offense and the character of the offender. Despite defendant's argument that he should have been sentenced to 30 years, the court found that the sentence imposed was within statutory limits and was imposed after the trial court gave full consideration to a presentence report and found that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the inmate had waived the issue of whether his sentence was unconstitutional but that even if it were properly before the court, it was without merit. The court held that the statute under which the inmate was sentenced provided for either the death penalty or life imprisonment for the greater offense of first-degree murder and that the inmate was properly sentenced under the law in effect at the time the crime was committed. The court found that the failure of the inmate's attorney to investigate the inmate's assertion that a prosecuting witness had struck up a bargain with the prosecutor for his testimony did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then instructed his employee to remove the individual from where he was standing in order to break into a store to obtain the property at issue. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the indictment charged the offense of disorderly conduct with sufficient certainty because some physical violence had already occurred between the men and the words defendant used during the confrontation were intended to produce and were likely to produce imminent disorder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accosted a woman, pointed a gun at her, and demanded she go with him behind a building. The woman screamed and defendant was apprehended. Defendant claimed the trial court erred in not giving tendered instructions, and that recent cases holding that trial courts should not inform juries of possible penalties arising from their verdicts of guilty should be overruled in light of the constitutional right of the jury to determine the law as well as the facts under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court affirmed the conviction. Sentencing was no longer a part of the verdict, therefore, the law regarding sentencing was not to be determined by the jury. The trial court was not required to inform the jury of defense counsel's theory of the constitutionality of the laws at issue, and it was not error to refuse an instruction when the substance of it was covered in another instruction. The instruction on the habitual offender sentence did not ask the jury to convict defendant of a non-existent crime, but instructed them to make a determination whether defendant had been convicted of prior felonies and make a determination that had sentencing ramifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by granting the State's oral motion in limine, which precluded him from mentioning the possible penalties upon conviction on the attempted murder charge. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the oral motion in limine was permitted and that the trial court did not err in granting the State's motion. The trial court had inherent discretion to grant or deny the motion and defendant had the opportunity to object to the motion but failed to do so. The trial court did not err in giving a preliminary instruction as to defendant's burden of proof on his insanity defense because the instruction did not involve a presumption. It merely stated Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-41-4-1 (1978). The statute did not violate either the United States or the Indiana Constitutions. Defendant's tendered instruction that included the claim that Indiana's Constitution contained a prohibition against verdicts being based upon punishment was simply not a correct statement of the law. Thus, there was no error by the trial court in refusing to give the instruction. All other assignments of error were without merit.</SPAN></P>

Acting on information supplied by the victim's wife, a police officer went to defendant's apartment. When defendant was arrested, another officer seized a pistol lying on a table in the apartment that was later determined to be the gun from which the fatal bullet was fired. After defendant was convicted, he argued that the defense of insanity was established as a matter of law. On appeal, the court found that there was conflicting evidence on the issue of insanity provided by defendant's family, state-appointed psychiatrists, and police officers. Based on the evidence, the court determined that the jury was justified in finding that defendant was sane. A witness present at the time of the shooting provided a description that matched defendant and the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. The court determined that there was ample circumstantial evidence to support the finding of guilty. The court also found that the trial court properly instructed the jury and properly allowed the State to introduce the murder weapon because it was seized in plain view.

Subsequently, the Commissioner reinstated the operator's license. The trial court ordered the Commissioner to suspend the operator's license, registration certificate, and registration of plates pursuant to Ind.

The operator claimed that because he discharged the judgment in bankruptcy, suspension was not appropriate. The court held that &sect; 9-2-1-11 provided for reinstatement privileges upon two conditions: (1) a showing that the judgment had been either satisfied or stayed; and (2) proof given by the judgment debtor of his financial responsibility in the future. However, the operator presented evidence showing that the tort judgment against him had been stayed by order of the bankruptcy court, and that he had been discharged from the judgment debt. He also presented evidence indicating that he had obtained automobile liability insurance. Finally, 1947 Ind. Acts 159(c) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

There was no showing that defendant was prejudiced by the trial court's denial of his motion for continuance.

The court determined that there was no violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2515. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had been twice convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned for felonies.

On remand the State filed additional charges and at the second trial defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to theft and accessory after the fact to kidnapping. The convictions were affirmed on appeal and defendant petitioned for post-conviction relief, which was denied. He appealed and the court affirmed, finding that the State had the authority to file the additional charges on remand and that the charges were filed within the applicable statute of limitations. It was not error to charge defendant as both a principal and an accessory for the same offense and whether the State should have been compelled to elect between counts, because they grew out of the same transaction, was within the sound discretion of the trial court. Venue was proper under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because defendant's act in furtherance of his criminal conduct that occurred in a foreign jurisdiction was not the only act that involved him in the offense. Defendant failed to present evidence to overcome the strong presumption that his counsel properly discharged his duties of representing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A relator filed a petition for a writ of mandate and prohibition against a circuit court and judge challenging the constitutionality of certain statutes, which concerned the appointment of a master commissioner by the circuit judge. The relator claimed that a commissioner tried the relator's marriage dissolution proceedings as a judge and contended that the commissioner had no jurisdiction or power under the statutes to purport to act a judge. The court granted the relator's petition for a writ of mandate and made a previously issued temporary writ permanent. The court vacated the commissioner's entries of judgment on the relator's dissolution proceeding and concluded that the relator was entitled to have such proceedings adjudged by a special judge. The court held that the commissioner could only act as an instrumentality to inform and assist the court by conducting hearings and reporting facts and conclusions to the court, but only the judge had the inherent authority not only to decide, but to make binding orders or judgments. As such, judicial powers could not be vested in commissioners appointed by judges since such power was exclusively reserved for the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the lack of specific criteria for sentencing under the statute, which ranged from life imprisonment to a period of not less than 15 nor more than 25 years, was not a denial of equal protection nor did it subject defendant to cruel and unusual punishment. The lack of criteria as a deficiency applied only to cases subject to the death penalty. Defendant contended that the sentence under &sect; 35-1-54-1 was not proportionate to the offense because the possible life sentence therein was also the penalty imposed for first-degree murder. The court concluded that the statute did not violate the proportionality requirements of the Eighth Amendment and Ind.

Ind. Code &sect; 35-5.1-4-7(d) clearly stated that the trial court was not limited in the matters that it could have considered in determining the sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Division of the Lake Superior Court, (Indiana) that convicted him of murder, under Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-1-1 (1979), and imposed a sentence of death, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-1-1 (1979), for knowingly or intentionally killing the victim. Following a sentencing hearing, it was determined that the murder was committed by defendant while committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and a sentence of death was recommended and thereafter decreed by the trial court, under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 (1979). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court found circumstantial evidence ample to permit a reasonable person to have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was the assailant with another at the time of the robbery and murder. In upholding the Indiana death penalty, the court held that the statutory and procedural scheme limited the imposition of death sentences in such manner as to assure that they would not be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and upon that basis, did not violate either the Eighth Amendment or Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16. The court further held that the death sentencing procedures and mandatory review procedures were consistent with those required by the United States Supreme Court and thus did not violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder and the imposed death sentence. The court remanded the cause to the trial court for the purpose of fixing a date for the sentence to be executed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant informed the court that he wished to waive his right to appeal his murder convictions and his death sentence. The court concluded that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(h) precluded waiver of a review of the sentencing in a death penalty case. The court affirmed the trial court's imposition of the death penalty, holding that the death penalty sentencing scheme set forth in Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 was constitutional because it contained the necessary procedural standards and guidelines. Moreover, it provided for procedures which enabled the court to review the imposition of the death penalty to further safeguard against the influence of improper or prejudicial factors at the trial level, and to further determine that the elements of arbitrariness and capriciousness were not present in the sentencing decision. However, the court also concluded that &sect; 35-50-2-9(h) did not preclude defendant from waiving the review of his murder conviction. The court upheld defendant's waiver, holding that his waiver was voluntarily and knowingly made based upon his appearance and demeanor before the court, and his responsiveness to the court's questions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld defendant's request to waive the appeal of his murder conviction, but denied defendant's request to waive the appeal of his death sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary and was sentenced by the trial court to not less than 10 nor more than 20 years. The trial court suspended all but one year of the sentence and placed defendant on probation for five years. The State appealed, contending that under Ind. Code &sect; 35-7-1-1 first-degree burglary was a non-probationable offense. The court reversed that portion of defendant's sentence that permitted probation and remanded the cause with instructions that the trial court modify the sentence accordingly. On remand the trial court modified the sentence but did not impose the term of imprisonment upon defendant. Instead the trial court embarked upon a series of hearings designed to determine whether or not defendant should be sentenced to the statutory period of confinement or had been rehabilitated since the time of his original sentencing. Ultimately the trial court imposed its original sentence and defendant's request that his probation be continued was denied.

He was sentenced to two years for the class D felony and 30 years on the habitual offender charge. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that (1) defendant's right to trial by jury was not offended by a statutory scheme which did not require a jury to fix punishment, (2) the sentencing statute was constitutional, (3) the admission of state's exhibits was not improper as defendant had been provided a copy of the exhibit and the testimony of a fingerprint expert was sufficient to establish a chain of custody, (4) the trial court properly instructed the jury not to consider a prior crime charged, but only the prior crime for which defendant was convicted, (5) the evidence submitted was sufficient to support the habitual criminal charge and the sentence on that charge did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, and (6) the instructions given to the jury were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with rape, deviate conduct, and as a habitual offender. The counts were severed. At his first trial he was convicted of deviate conduct, he was sentenced to 40 years, and the state dismissed the other two counts. However, when defendant successfully appealed, the state refiled the two counts. At the second trial, a jury found defendant guilty of all three charges, and he was sentenced to 60 years in prison. On appeal, the court reversed the rape and habitual offender convictions and affirmed the deviate conduct conviction. The court held the state failed to meet its burden of proving that the timing of the refiling of the charges was not motivated by vindictiveness. The refiling violated defendant's due process and appeal rights by punishing him for pursuing an appeal. The court also found the Indiana rape shield statute did not violate the equal protection clause; deputy prosecutors were competent witnesses who could testify as to defendant's appearance at the time of the prior trial; and because the unavailability of a medical witness was sufficiently established, there was no abuse of discretion in allowing the admission of her prior recorded testimony.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the State failed to prove defendant's conduct was unlawful because it did not present sufficient proof on the absence of heat of passion. The court held that the record was devoid of evidence suggesting that the decedent provoked defendant. The jury was in fact instructed on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. Whether or not defendant was of such a state of mind as to have been guilty of murder, or whether he acted in the heat of passion upon sufficient provocation, were questions for the jury. Further, defendant's claim that the State did not prove that he acted knowingly, as required by statute, was also without merit. Specifically, an act was done purposely, if it was willed, was the product of conscious design, intent, or plan that it be done, and was done with an awareness of probable consequences. Moreover, &quot;purpose&quot; could have been inferred from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon in a manner likely to cause death or great bodily harm. Defendant deliberately and viciously attacked an unarmed man who had not provoked him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor challenged the constitutionality of the statute of limitations portions of the Medical Malpractice Act of 1975 contending that the two year limitation upon malpractice actions denied minors equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, and their remedy by due course of law guaranteed by Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court found that the statutory provisions established a two year statute of limitation in malpractice cases and obligated the class of infants between the ages of 6 and 21 years of age to institute their actions within that time. The court concluded that the class was not suspect and called for rationality to be the standard by which to judge the minor's classification. The court found that there existed a reasonable basis for the legislature to strengthen the statute of limitation in malpractice cases and to conclude that children of the class and adults were similarly situated with regard to their ability to bring malpractice actions even though it admitted that the standard was a stern one and had harsh application.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant to be a habitual offender under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. First, the court found that the trial court had not erred in refusing to grant defendant's motion for a continuance, which was filed one day prior to trial, even though his counsel had been notified by the state of four additional witnesses only five days before the trial. The court found that there was no element of surprise as to the four additional witnesses' testimony since two of them testified only as to the identification of defendant's automobile and the other two merely corroborated the bank manager's testimony about the bank's procedures in handling checks. The court also found that sufficient evidence had been presented to establish an intent to defraud, which was a necessary element of the crime. Finally, the court did not find that the penalty imposed by the habitual offender statute was so grossly disproportionate to the offense committed as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-1-47-2 (1980), the State could appeal from a judgment for defendant quashing or setting aside an indictment or sustaining a plea in abatement, from an order in favor of defendant on his motion for discharge or plea of former jeopardy, from a judgment arresting judgment, or from a question reserved by the State. The court dismissed the appeal. Under Ind. R. App. P. 4(B), an appeal could be taken by the State if it were certified by the trial court. The court found that where interlocutory appeals had been allowed in other actions, it was in narrow circumstances. Since the State's interlocutory appeal did not address the constitutionality of a statute, it was distinguishable from other cases where appeal was allowed. The issue of the suppression of defendant's confession was the same as the admissibility of evidence during the course of a trial and was not a proper subject for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed a bank with a sawed-off shotgun, escaped, and killed the police officer who pursued him. Defendant was captured in a vacant house, and the police found evidence in the bathroom. Defendant was charged with first-degree murder and bank robbery, but the trial court convicted him of second-degree murder and bank robbery. Defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in limiting his number of peremptory challenges, that the trial court improperly refused to sequester the jury, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements made to police officers, and that the trial court improperly admitted evidence illegally seized from his truck. The court affirmed. The court held that defendant was only entitled to 10 peremptory challenges because he was not subject to the death penalty. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sequester the jury at the beginning of his trial. Defendant's statements were admissible because he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights. Evidence from defendant's truck was properly admitted because the police had probable cause to conduct the search.</SPAN></P>

On the second day of trial, defendant failed to reappear, following lunch recess, and the trial continued and concluded in his absence. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting defendant's confession and in continuing the trial in defendant's absence. Defendant also asserted that the trial court erred in refusing to give an instruction requested by defendant. Finally, defendant argued that the bifurcated procedure provided for by the habitual offenders statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-50-2-8 (1979), was unconstitutional. The court found that there was ample evidence to support the trial court's finding that the confession was voluntary and not the result of a promise or coercion. The court also held that defendant waived his right to be present for the remainder of the trial. Further, the court determined that defendant failed to give a specific objection to the judge's refusal to give his requested instruction as required by Ind. R. Crim. P. 8(B). Finally, the court concluded that the bifurcated procedure under the habitual offender statute whereby the same jury heard both issues was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

When they caught defendant, an altercation occurred and defendant slashed the victim's associate with the knife. After the trial, defendant was convicted of robbery, class A, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the relevant robbery statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-5-1 was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute provided fair warning when it stated that culpability arose when robbery resulted in bodily injury to another person. That language did not introduce impermissible generality into the statute. The court also ruled that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's conclusion that the injury to the victim's associate was a result of the victim's robbery. Further, the court held that the criminal court did not err when it denied the motion for mistrial. Finally, the criminal court properly barred defense counsel from referring to possible sentences under &sect; 35-42-5-1 and did not err when it instructed the jury regarding the general possible penalties for conviction under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Indiana sought review of three judgments from the Marion Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed its motions for new trial to determine the habitual criminal offender status of three separate defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was convicted of a crime and the State attempted to have them sentenced as habitual criminals. However, the jury advised the trial court that it was unable to reach a verdict at the sentencing hearings. The trial court declared a mistrial in each case and discharged the jury. The State's motions for a new trial were denied, and the habitual offender allegations were dismissed. One defendant was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and the other two were not sentenced for the underlying crimes. The State initiated interlocutory appeals to the appellate court which stayed the sentencing of defendants until their cases were decided. All three appeals were transferred to the instant court and were consolidated. Upon review, the court reversed and remanded the judgments of the trial court. A retrial on the habitual offender question could have been limited to an easily severed issue of fact. The fact that habitual criminal status was not a separate crime did not change that result. It was in the public interest that the State should have been given another opportunity to secure an enhanced penalty because the first attempt resulted in a deadlocked jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit a felony, possession of burglar tools by a convicted felon, and being a habitual criminal. He sought review of the convictions. The court reversed defendant's conviction on the state's conspiracy charge. The court held that the trial court erred when it refused to sever the conspiracy count from the possession count. The court noted that proof of defendant's prior felony conviction was admissible on the possession charge because the prior conviction was an element of that offense. However, the court said, a prior conviction was not only not an element of the conspiracy charge, it was highly prejudicial. Therefore, the court said, the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to sever the two charges. However, the court upheld defendant's conviction on the possession charge. First, the court said that the possession statute was constitutional. Second, the court found that the burglar tools and the testimony of defendant's co-conspirator were admissible. Third, the court said that certified documents pertaining to defendant's prior convictions were admissible because they tended to identify defendant as a felon.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of burglary and as a habitual offender. The court affirmed the judgment of convictions. The court held that only the witness had the right to invoke his right against self-incrimination and defendant had no right to assert that privilege. Moreover, because the witness stated that he did not want to testify due to personal reasons and such a reason was not grounds for invoking the privilege, the trial court did not err in compelling the witness to testify. There was also adequate evidence that defendant had knowledge that the witness was committing a burglary sufficient to convict defendant of burglary.

Defendant contended that he did not receive a fair and impartial trial in Putnam County because of the excitement and prejudice engendered therein. In affirming the judgment, the court held that defendant failed to show that the jurors were unable to set aside preconceived notions and render a verdict based upon the evidence. Furthermore, there was no showing that defendant exhausted his peremptory challenges in an effort to secure juror impartiality. Defendant also contended that the evidence of kidnapping was insufficient because he was not acting &quot;knowingly or intentionally&quot; because his accomplice was coercing him. The court found that the only evidence that defendant was not acting &quot;knowingly or intentionally&quot; came from defendant himself. The jury was not bound to accept this premise, given that the remainder of the evidence pertaining to defendant's culpability amply supported a finding that he and the accomplice were acting together.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the circuit court did not err when it permitted exhibits and testimony concerning an alleged robbery plan to be placed in evidence. This evidence drew a direct connection between appellant and the crimes with which he was charged in the case at bar. Therefore, the evidence was properly admitted. Further, the court found no abuse of discretion in the circuit court's handling of the form of cross-examination. Because the jury was not exposed to prejudicial publicity or information, the circuit court did not err in denying appellant's motion to sequester the jury. However, the court agreed with appellant that the circuit court erred in not holding the death penalty portion of the murder statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-1-29-1 and 35-13-4-1(b)(6)(ii), unconstitutional. Subsequent to this trial, the court had held the death penalty portion of the murder statute unconstitutional. The court therefore affirmed appellant's conviction but vacated the death sentence and remanded the cause with instructions to enter a sentence of life imprisonment on each count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that the lower court erred in allowing the class action to proceed, in denying the state's motion to dismiss for failure to name the real parties in interest, and in declaring the act unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment because the taxpayers personally satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of the class action statute by exhausting their administrative remedies before bringing their action. The claim itself was constitutional in nature and sought to void the taxing statute because it discriminated against a class to which the taxpayers belonged, namely, non-residents. The claim provided a basis for class-wide relief in the absence of certification. Therefore, the certification of the action as class action did not vitiate or evade the jurisdictional requirements of the statute. The court further found that the taxpayers sought refunds of all of the monies collected under the act. Therefore, the state's department of revenue was a proper party in the action. The court also found that the act impermissibly discriminated against the non-resident taxpayers in violation of their rights, privileges, and immunities under the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court found the testimony of the victims and the other witness and the identification evidence sufficient to support the jury's verdict. The instructions clearly defined the presumption of innocence and the State's burden in overcoming that presumption. The testimony about the gun was detailed and more than sufficient to uphold the jury's finding that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon. The &quot;single larceny&quot; doctrine did not apply to the situation here where defendant took the individual property of separate individuals. The habitual offender procedures did not unconstitutionally subject defendant to two trials. The double jeopardy provisions did not apply to the habitual offender statute because there was no new prosecution. The habitual offender statute did not impose punishment for a separate crime, but provided a more severe penalty for the crime charged. It was not a separate felony and the statutes of limitations for felonies did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although the requirement was restrictive, it did not violate the patients' rights to the courts. Further, the court found that the requirement was consistent with the Act's purpose of preserving health care services for the community. The patients also claimed that the Act was void for vagueness because it did not specified in detail the procedures and practices to be followed before the medical review board. The court rejected this argument, finding that the Act contemplated that the medical review board would function in an informal and reasonable manner and that the proceedings would be guided by a trained attorney allowing both sides to present evidence.

The court found that the State's right to appeal was limited to the instances provided in Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-47-2 (1979) and required defendant to have been acquitted. The trial court's decision to discharge the habitual offender count with prejudice, however, was not an acquittal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Jay Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted him of burglary, theft, and being an habitual offender pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8 (1979). He was sentenced to terms of five years, two years, and 30 years respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was previously tried on an unrelated rape charge, publicity was generated concerning controversial rulings by the trial court, and the charges were dismissed. After defendant was charged in the instant case, his motion for a change of venue was denied, and he was convicted of burglary, theft, and being an habitual offender. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the venue motion in light of the length of time between the trials, the fact that the cases involved different charges, and the fact that the judge was the subject of the articles. The mandatory 30-year sentence for the habitual offender conviction did not violate defendant's constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment. Because the purpose of &sect; 35-50-2-8 was to punish recidivism, it could not be said that the sentence was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. Finally, the trial court's refusal to advise the jury of the penalty was proper because the trial court judge determined the sentence and the jury only had to be instructed on matters necessary for their information in giving the verdict.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of kidnapping, first degree murder, aggravated assault, battery, and killing a human being while perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a kidnapping. The death penalty was imposed for the charge of killing while perpetrating a kidnapping. The court remanded the action with directions to vacate the death penalty because &sect; 35-13-4-1(b) had been declared unconstitutional due to the failure to include procedural safeguards. In addition, defendant was entitled to credit for time served prior to his conviction. In all other respects, the conviction was affirmed. Defendant's cross-section challenge to the jury failed because he did not show that any particular groups were excluded the use of property tax roles to obtain jurors. Gruesome photos of the victim were properly admitted as being relevant. Evidence that defendant raped the wife was properly admitted under the theory of res gestae.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder during the commission of a felony, Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-1, and robbery, Ind.

A change of venue was not mandatory under Ind. R. Crim. P. 12 because defendant's crime was not punishable by the death penalty, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to try defendant on the robbery charge. Defendant's waiver of jurisdiction on the felony murder charge had equal applicability to the lesser-included offense subsequently charged. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting a heavy metal &quot;T&quot; bar into evidence because the slight and irrelevant differences between the exhibit and the &quot;T&quot; bar actually used did not render the exhibit irrelevant or unfairly prejudice defendant in any way. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in amending defendant's tendered instruction number one. Under Ind. R. App. P. 8.3(A) defendant had waived this issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a plea of guilty, defendant was sentenced on May 16, 1977 to a determinate term pursuant to Ind.

The deficiency in the statute was stated to be its prohibition against the suspension of the determinate sentence to be meted out upon conviction for committing or attempting to commit a felony while armed. On appeal, the court remanded with instructions, holding that because the non-suspendibility provision of &sect; 35-12-1-1 was not constitutionally deficient, the trial court should not have suspended defendant's sentence and the trial court was limited to sentence defendant under the provisions of &sect; 35-12-1-1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Marion Superior Court, Criminal Division (Indiana) convicting defendant of theft, following a jury trial, and sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment for theft and 30 years under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State established that defendant had previously been convicted of theft and was fined, and that he was previously convicted of entering with intent to commit a felony. Defendant argued, inter alia, that sentencing under &sect; 35-50-2-8 constituted double jeopardy in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-4-3 (1979) and Ind. Const. art. 1 &sect; 14, and that the 30-year sentence for habitual offenders violated Ind. Const. art. 1 &sect;&sect; 16 and 18 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII. In addition, he argued that one of the two prior felonies forming the basis for defendant's sentencing as a habitual offender was in fact a misdemeanor, and that the sentencing procedure under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8 (1979) violated defendant's right to trial by a fair and impartial jury. The court held that: (1) because the habitual offender sentencing was neither a separate criminal charge nor an additional penalty for earlier crimes, defendant was not placed in double jeopardy; (2) the 30-year sentence under &sect; 35-50-2-8, which was not grossly or unquestionably excessive or vindictive, was constitutional; and (3) the admission of evidence of prior crimes in the one-stage recidivist trial did not unnecessarily prejudice the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped a truck for displaying a paper registration in the window and an expired license plate, and the truck had just been purchased from defendant's business.

The officer went to defendant's business and told a salesman that he wanted to inspect all of the dealer's titles as authorized by Ind. Code &sect; 9-1-2-3(b) (1973). After examining the titles, the officer found that nine additional titles were open and that four were to vehicles that had been junked. Defendant was charged for these violations, and he filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his business. The trial court sustained the motion, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the search was not an unconstitutional invasion of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights because it was authorized by &sect; 9-1-2-3(b) to which defendant had to comply when he was licensed to deal in motor vehicles. The motion to suppress was an appealable order because it was tantamount to a dismissal of the case.

Defendant was convicted of theft, automobile banditry, and possession of burglary tools and also adjudicated a habitual offender. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that (1) in view of the long history of substitutions and continuances in the record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for a continuance so that defendant might again substitute counsel on the morning of trial; (2) defendant's motion announcing his reliance on an alibi defense was not timely and, therefore, the trial court was justified in striking the notice and excluding alibi evidence; (3) the prosecutor's cross-examination concerning defendant's prior crimes was proper since defendant had brought the subject up; and (4) evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended the trial court erred in dismissing its information requesting the death penalty, based on defendant's murder of another person for which he had not been convicted at the time of his sentencing for the first, unrelated murder. Defendant claimed Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(b)(8) was unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that: (1) the sentencing hearing in the present case would amount to nothing short of a full trial on the aggravating circumstance issue because the state would have to prove the existence of the aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, &sect; 35-50-2-9(a), a complete prima facie case; (2) defendant would then be permitted to offer, as mitigating circumstances, evidence of any other circumstances appropriate for consideration, &sect; 35-50-2-9(c)(7), (d); (3) this would involve the same witnesses, evidence, and testimony that would appear in a normal criminal trial; (4) the result of applying &sect; 35-50-2-9(b)(8) to this case would be two trials; thus, (5) defendant would be tried for the subsequent murder at the sentencing phase of his first murder trial, in violation of his due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of judgments of several Indiana superior courts declaring Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-1 unconstitutional. All the cases on appeal involved the same conduct, nude dancing or appearances in bars, which was a punishable offense of public indecency under &sect; 35-45-1. Appellees were owners and operators of bars and taverns offering nude dancing in their establishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of judgments declaring an indecency statute unconstitutional, the court found no merit in the contention of the owners and operators that &sect; 35-45-4-1 was vague because the word &quot;public&quot; was undefined. The court held that the activities of appearing nude in bars and dancing in bars were not entitled to First Amendment protection, and therefore &sect; 35-45-4-1 was not entitled to consideration under the overbreadth doctrine. In so holding, the court noted that the owners and operators complained that they made less money when dancers appeared scantily clad than when they appeared nude. This was a claim for some kind of right to appear nude in public and, in this context, to appear nude in public for money. This activity was conduct, not speech, and as such, it did not rise to the level of a First Amendment claim. The court then determined that case law restricted and defined public nudity under public indecency statutes, and state statutes provided for procedures and standards to determine obscenity. Accordingly, the argument that &sect; 35-45-4-1 was overbroad failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the superior courts' judgments and declared the indecency statute to be constitutional as a valid exercise of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) while there was no right to appeal from a denial of parole, due process required that judicial review be available to insure due process had been met by the Parole Board; (2) the Indiana parole release statute created no expectancy of release by the prisoner because the Parole Board was vested with almost total discretion in the matter; (3) the Parole Board gave the prisoner adequate and sufficient reason for the denial of his parole; (4) the prisoner was not entitled to access to his institutional file absent a request to access the information; and (5) Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue from the judge because he failed to satisfy the requirements of Ind.

His application did not disclose when or how the alleged bias was first discovered, the facts warranting a change, or why it was not discovered earlier to justify an exception from the requirement that his motion had to be filed within 10 days of his plea. Defendant also failed to establish that the trial court abused its discretion in denying him a separate trial where his co-defendant took the stand and was available for cross-examination on his oral statement to police. The court found that defendant's life sentence was within constitutional limits and that his argument that the trial court erred in sentencing him to life imprisonment for inflicting physical injury while attempting to commit robbery rather than to 10 years for committing armed robbery was not supported by authority. The court determined that defendant was sufficiently identified by name and by witnesses indicating that he was sitting to the prosecutor's left.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the first defendant committed an armed bank robbery. During the course of the robbery, the first defendant ordered four tellers to fill a pillow case with money. The first defendant then fled to a get-away car, driven by the second defendant. An assistant bank manager chased the first defendant. When the first defendant noticed his pursuer, he fired his gun, and then jumped into the trunk of the get-away car. Defendants raised numerous issues on appeal, which the court rejected as meritless. However, the court agreed with the argument that the first defendant's conduct consisted only of one offense of armed robbery, not four. Likewise, the court found that the second defendant's conduct consisted only of one offense of theft, not four. The court reasoned that only one bank was robbed, even though four tellers were involved. Accordingly, the court affirmed the first defendant's convictions for one count of armed robbery and one count of attempted involuntary manslaughter, and affirmed the second defendant's conviction for one count of theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Rush Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted him of theft in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-17-5-3 (1975) and being a habitual criminal in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-8-8-1 (1975). Defendant was given an indeterminate sentence of 1 to 10 years on the theft count and a life sentence on the habitual criminal count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-2-2 (1975), psychiatrists were appointed by the trial court to examine defendant and to testify at trial; thus, the trial court's refusal to allow defendant to retain his own expert did not, per se, force defendant to withdraw his temporary insanity defense. The addition of a habitual criminal charge to the original information was proper because defendant had adequate time to prepare his defense and his substantial rights were not harmed. Defendant waived the issues raised in his oral motion to dismiss the habitual criminal count because the issues were not raised in his earlier written motion to dismiss, which contained the memorandum describing the alleged defects as required under Ind. R. Crim. P. 3. The taking of defendant's fingerprints without counsel present violated none of his constitutional rights. Defendant's life sentence under the habitual criminal statute did not run afoul of either U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16. The prosecutor's use of the habitual criminal statute to allegedly coerce defendant into pleading guilty to theft was a justifiable exploitation of bargaining leverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court but remanded with instructions to vacate the 1 to 10 year sentence imposed on the theft conviction and to correct the sentence. Defendant should have been sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of theft, having been found to be a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>

In his pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, he stated that he was being illegally restrained because he was denied due process in the denial of his parole and because there was no appeal from a denial of parole. On appeal, petitioner also argued that Ind. Code &sect; 11-1-1-9 (amended 1978) was unconstitutional because it gave the Indiana Parole Board unfettered discretion in arriving at a parole determination. The court held that because the record showed on its face that petitioner was not entitled to release, the habeas corpus petition was properly denied without a hearing. The court then, under its discretionary authority, examined the record on its merits, noted that petitioner had appeared before the parole board on three occasions when he was given hearings at which he was present and given an opportunity to speak, and that he had received a written statement of reasons for denial of parole. Thus, petitioner was afforded his constitutional right to due process of law and the denial of his parole was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Madison County Circuit Court (Indiana), which denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The appellate court treated and decided defendant's request as a petition for post-conviction relief. At issue was whether defendant was entitled to good time credit on a 20-year term that defendant was serving concurrently with a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of inflicting injury while attempting robbery and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Eight years later he was sentenced to a determinate 20-year term for armed robbery. Defendant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that he was entitled to good time credit on his 20-year term. The circuit court treated the petition as a motion for post-conviction relief and denied it. Defendant appealed, arguing that denial of good time credit on the 20 year sentence constituted an ex post facto application of Ind. Code &sect; 11-7-6.1-2 (1977). The court reversed. The court acknowledged that at the time defendant's life sentence was imposed, Ind. Code &sect; 11-7-6-1 (1973) did not permit an inmate to receive good time credit on a life sentence. The court noted, however, that &sect; 11-7-6-1 did not preclude a person serving a determinate sentence from receiving good time credit if he were concurrently serving a life sentence. Noting that Ind. Code &sect; 11-7-6-2 defined &quot;inmate&quot; as one who was within the walls of a state correctional institution, the court concluded that defendant was entitled to good time credit on his determinate sentence from the date of the life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that denied defendant's petition for post-conviction relief. The court remanded to the trial court with instructions to refer the matter to the department of correction for classification of defendant for diminution of time from his determinate sentence as of the date that defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The claimant's request for benefits was originally denied when the board ruled that he voluntarily left his employment without &quot;good cause in connection with the work,&quot; as required by Ind.

He claimed that his religion prevented him from working there. The intermediate appellate court held that Ind. Code &sect; 22-4-15-1 (1974) was unconstitutional because it cast an impermissible burden upon the claimant's First Amendment guarantee to the free exercise of his religion. On appeal, the court disagreed, granted transfer, and affirmed the board's denial of unemployment benefits to the claimant. The court explained that in the area of unemployment compensation, Indiana distinguished between statutory &quot;good cause&quot; for quitting work and some valid personal reason. Neutral objective standards had to be met to qualify for compensation. The board's finding and conclusion that the claimant voluntarily left his employment without good cause in connection with the work was held to be correct. The statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 22-4-15-1 (1974), imposed only an indirect burden, if any, on claimant's free exercise of his religion. It did not make any religious practice unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elected member sought review of a decision of the Tippecanoe Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted judgment in favor of appellees, township trustee, Advisory Board, and the attorney general, in an action filed by the elected member for her commission on the ground that a freehold requirement constituted an arbitrary denial of due process and equal protection under the U.S. Const. amend. 14th and Ind. Const. art. I &sect;&sect; 12 and 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The elected member filed a petition to transfer under the emergency provisions of Ind. R. App. P. 4(A)(10). After the elected member to the advisory board was elected, her attempt to assume office was refused on the ground that she did not own real estate in the township. On appeal, due to an error in the handling of the case, the case became moot as the term of office the elected member was elected to expired. The court held that since the questions raised were likely to recur, and since the delay was the fault of the court, it would decide the issues on their merits. The court found that since non-freeholders paid no property taxes, there was little if any incentive for them to treat tax-paying freeholders with equity and fairness in the imposition of property tax rates. The court held that to hold Ind. Code &sect; 17-4-28-1 (1974) unconstitutional would be to create a perverse situation where those who paid taxes to support the township government would be at the mercy of those who did not. The court concluded that the restriction of property ownership was not arbitrary or capricious, but bore a rational relation to the legitimate purpose for which the statute was enacted.</SPAN></P>

As such, the court treated his petition as a petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate argued that it was unlawful and unconstitutional to deny good time credits to those inmates serving life sentences and to deny certain rehabilitative services to those inmates serving life sentences. Specifically, the inmate asserted and the evidence demonstrated that &quot;lifers&quot; did not receive an initial evaluation and rehabilitation plan, that their behavior was not evaluated periodically, and they were the last to be considered for educational and vocational programs. The court affirmed the judgment, explaining that the disparate treatment of &quot;lifers&quot; verses &quot;non-lifers&quot; in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 11-7-6.1-2 (1977) (repealed 1977) was supported by a legitimate state interest and, therefore, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Ind.

The court found that the &sect; 35-8-8-1, which allowed the trial court to sentence defendant as an habitual offender, was constitutional. The court further determined that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of a hat, knife, billfold, and driver's license because the items were all hard physical evidence whose characteristics were capable of eyewitness identification.

The court found that defendant's argument that a sentence of one to five years' imprisonment was the maximum allowable for the crime of entering to commit a felony whenever first or second-degree burglary was originally charged was erroneous.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the trial court read the indictment to appellant, which contained the allegation that she had administered arsenic poison to her husband and that he died as a direct result of such poisoning. The trial court then asked appellant if she was pleading guilty because she had purposely and maliciously taken her husband's life and she answered, &quot;yes, I did.&quot; A police officer testified that appellant had admitted that she attempted to kill her husband with ant poison on two previous occasions and admitted that she had checked a book out of the library entitled &quot;To Kill With Kindness.&quot; She told the officer that that she had read that book prior to giving her husband ant poison. The court ruled that the evidence constituted a sufficient factual basis for the trial court's acceptance of appellant's plea of guilty. In addition, the court held that the prosecutor's comment at sentencing that there was little difference between a sentence of 15 to 25 years and life imprisonment, did not, as claimed by appellant, place her in a position of grave peril because there was no indication that the sentencing judge was influenced by the prosecutor's remark.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant two's motion to suppress because he had no standing to assert Fourth Amendment protection in a car owned by another in which he had no expectation of privacy. The court also held that the trial court properly denied defendant one's motion to suppress because, although he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a car owned by his wife, the police officers' actions in impounding and searching the car were reasonable under the circumstances. The police had probable cause to suspect that the vehicle was the one used in the commission of the murders and the kidnapping. Defendants further objected to the trial court's admission of hearsay testimony by the kidnapping victim. In rejecting that argument, the court found that the testimony added nothing of substance that was not already before the jury. Cumulative evidence was not grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state appealed an order of the Delaware Superior Court (Indiana) that granted summary judgment to plaintiff marriage applicant in her action challenging the constitutionality of a portion of Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-3-3 (Supp. 1978) that restricted the issuance of marriage licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was engaged to be married to a man who was divorced and who had been ordered to pay child support. The couple's application for a marriage license was denied because the man was in arrears on his support payments. The applicant challenged the constitutionality of a portion of Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-3-3 (Supp. 1978), which provided that a marriage license could not be issued to any person who had dependent children unless that person proved he was supporting or contributing to the support of each dependent child in compliance with any court orders for support. The trial court granted summary judgment to the applicant, finding that portion of the statute unconstitutional. The state argued that the statute was not an absolute prohibition against the freedom to marry because members of the affected class could seek modifications of their support orders or support agreements and then proceed to marry. The court affirmed the trial court's order and held that the statute significantly interfered with the exercise of a fundamental right. The challenged provision, being both underinclusive and overinclusive, was not narrowly drawn to effectuate the interests it purported to uphold.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment of the Elkhart Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted defendant of first-degree burglary, but determined that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-7-1-1 (1975) was unconstitutional and sentenced defendant to probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 35-7-1-1 mandated that when a trial court was sentencing a defendant for first-degree burglary, the trial court was not allowed to impose probation as a sentence. The trial court determined that this statute was unconstitutional as it constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that it had jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of &sect; 35-7-1-1. The court determined that the trial court erred in holding the challenged statute unconstitutional. The legislature had the authority to provide which acts should have been crimes and to provide for their penalties therefor. Thus, the trial court had no authority to enter an order suspending defendant's sentence and was limited to sentencing defendant to a term of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for modification of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
