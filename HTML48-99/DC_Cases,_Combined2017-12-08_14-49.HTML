Code &sect; 22-2801 (repealed 1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant repeatedly molested and raped his cousin over a two-year period, beginning when she was fifteen. He was convicted of carnal knowledge of a child under sixteen and rape, both in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-2801 (repealed 1995). Defendant appealed, contending the indictment was unconstitutionally vague and that the prosecution's evidence constructively amended the allegedly defective indictment. In affirming, the court noted that the particularity of time was not essential to the indictment as the young victim could not be expected to recall exact dates and times, especially where she was afraid to report the abuse contemporaneously. As the indictment provided a time frame with a distinct beginning and a clear end within which the crimes were committed, it satisfied constitutional requirements. The court rejected defendant's argument of constructive amendment as it construed the indictment of alleging a series of incidents and not as one such incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed as the indictment against him was not unconstitutionally vague where it provided a precise time frame during which defendant was alleged to have committed the crimes even though it did not contain exact dates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were demonstrating on the sidewalk below the Supreme Court plaza. They moved inside the plaza area to the top of the steps leading to the Court's main entrance and unfurled a large banner that read &quot;stop executions.&quot; Appellants were arrested and later convicted of violating 40 U.S.C.S. &sect; 13k, which provided that it was unlawful to assemble or to display such a banner in the Supreme Court Building or grounds. Appellants challenged the conviction, contending that the plaza was a government-designated public forum and that the statute violated their First Amendment rights of free speech. Appellants also claimed that the statute was an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech. The government claimed that the plaza was a nonpublic forum and that the statute was constitutional because it was reasonable and did not constitute viewpoint discrimination. The court found that the plaza was a nonpublic forum, that the statute was a constitutional regulation of the forum because it reasonably supported the purpose of the Supreme Court plaza, and that exclusion of appellants' demonstration was not viewpoint-based.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother was convicted of violating the Compulsory School Attendance Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-402 (1995), in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Appellant challenged the statute as unconstitutional for vagueness and asserted that the lower court abused its discretion by refusing to authorize defense counsel to hire an expert child psychologist at government expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected appellant mother's constitutional argument, but remanded for entry of an order authorizing the services of a child psychologist. It held that the lower court judge correctly construed the Compulsory School Attendance Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 31-402 (1995), to require reasonable efforts on the part of a parent, establishing that the statute was not vague. Further, it gave reasonable notice as to proscribed conduct and provided ample warning that criminal liability could result. Yet, the court was persuaded that a reasonable attorney would have pursued a defense involving school phobia. Accordingly, denial of the request for authorization to hire a psychologist was error. The defense adequately showed need for expert psychological testimony to explain the intensity of the child's resistance to attending school and the nature of the child's reaction to separation from her mother. The court remanded the case with instructions to authorize appellant mother's counsel to hire a child psychologist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the Compulsory School Attendance Act was not constitutionally vague because it established a reasonable efforts standard, gave notice of proscribed conduct, and provided warning as to criminal liability. However, where a reasonable attorney would have defended on a school phobia theory, the court found error in refusing to authorize the hiring of a child psychologist and remanded for an order to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant government official appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, favoring plaintiff union and enjoining, as violative of free speech, the enforcement of certain noise limits under the District of Columbia Noise Control Act, D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 3001.1 and 3011.1 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After it received a cease and desist order to refrain from using bullhorns and loudspeakers at picketing sites, plaintiff union sued defendant government official, claiming that certain noise limits under the District of Columbia Noise Control Act, D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 3001.1 and 3011.1 (1984), violated their free speech rights, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. I. Summary judgment was entered for plaintiff and an injunction against the law was issued. Defendant appealed. While the appeal was pending, the District of Columbia City Council amended the law, D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 20, &sect; 2700 et seq. (1997), to exempt loudspeakers and otherwise make the law constitutional. Conceding that the appeal was thus moot, plaintiff argued that the underlying judgment should stand under the rule that a party cannot circumvent appellate review and avoid the consequence of a judgment by causing mootness and then seeking the equitable remedy of vacatur. In overruling such objections, vacating the judgment, and dismissing the complaint, the court determined that the rule should not apply here because the law was amended not to overturn precedent, but to repair a constitutionally defective law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated and the complaint dismissed because the challenged noise regulations were amended while the appeal was pending to eliminate any unconstitutionality, thereby mooting the appeal, and because the equitable remedy of vacatur was not improper, since the government action in mooting the appeal was undertaken to correct a defective law and not to simply avoid the precedential consequence of the judgment against it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which held that D.C. Code &sect; 47-1803.3(a)(14) was not applicable to unincorporated businesses because of limiting references in the subsection to the federal tax code. Appellant, a limited partnership, had previously attempted to claim a forward rolling deduction pursuant to the statute that was disallowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a limited partnership, attempted to claim a forward rolling deduction of its prior losses against positive income it earned pursuant to its reading of D.C. Code &sect; 47-1803.3(a)(14). The deduction was disallowed by the District of Columbia's taxing authority. The tax division of the trial court later granted summary judgment to appellee, the District of Columbia, finding that &sect; 47-1803.3(a)(14) was not applicable to unincorporated businesses like appellant due to what was read as limiting references in the subsection to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). On appeal, the court dealt with both parties' interpretation of &sect; 47-1803.3(a)(14) and how it interacted with the IRC. The court found that the statute, on its face and in accord with the natural reading of its language, appeared to provide the deduction consistently across the board to all organizations taxed at the entity level, in accord with appellee's decision to treat not only corporations but unincorporated businesses as separate tax entities. Appellant's reading of the statute also appeared to reflect the legislative intent, insofar as it could be divined from the record. The order below was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother filed a wrongful death and survival action against appellant government. Appellee alleged medical malpractice and other negligence caused the death of her son while at a juvenile correctional facility operated by appellant. The jury returned a verdict for appellee. The trial court denied appellant's motion to set aside the verdict. Appellant sought review. In order to prove her claim, appellee had the burden of proving the applicable standard of care, a deviation from that standard by appellant, and a causal relationship between the deviation and the appellee's injury. To prove breach of the standard of care, appellee had to establish through expert testimony the course of action that a reasonably prudent doctor with the appellant's specialty would have taken under the same or similar circumstances. The court affirmed because the testimony of appellee's expert was sufficient to establish a standard of care, a breach of that standard, and proximate cause. The court found sufficient evidence to establish a proximate cause between the alleged negligence and the death of appellee's son because if her son would have received adequate care, he would not have died.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 22-2723 (1996), claiming a violation of the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was convicted of soliciting a supposed prostitute, who was actually an undercover police officer. After the trial court declared a forfeiture and condemnation of his truck under the Act, the owner appealed. The court reversed. The forfeiture was deemed a constitutionally excessive fine. The forfeiture was, at least in part, punishment for his solicitation of the undercover officer and was therefore a fine subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny. Solicitation for prostitution, particularly for a first conviction, was treated as a minor crime in the District of Columbia. The owner was a first time offender. Forfeiting the truck inflicted a penalty of 50 times the fine authorized by the statute and 100 the fine actually imposed. Those ratios were consistent with excessiveness determinations of other federal courts. The court did not agree with appellee city's argument that the Act had solely a remedial purpose. The Act sought to form part of the arsenal of steps aimed at the problem of prostitution. The Act had at least some punitive aspect and, as such, came within the protection of the Excessive Fines Clause.</SPAN></P>

The church argued that the board should have granted its requested continuance so that it would have more time to prepare and should not have struck its exhibits. The court affirmed, and held that a court must be extremely deferential to the board's decision to grant or deny a continuance or otherwise accommodate an interested party's demand for additional time in quasi-legislative matters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the District of Columbia (District), appealed an order of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which held that &sect; 803(d) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, codified at 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;1997e(d), did not apply to limit the attorney's fees available to an attorney for plaintiffs, a certified class of juveniles confined in juvenile institutions, who had brought a civil rights action against the District.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class had entered into a consent decree with the District, settling a suit alleging that the District had subjected class members to unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful conditions of confinement. The District allegedly failed to comply with the consent decree, and litigation ensued. An attorney for the class submitted a bill for services on behalf of the class, and the District objected to the amount claimed, arguing that the PLRA limited the amount of fees available. The trial court disagreed with the District, but the court agreed. In analyzing the meaning of the relevant provisions of the PLRA, the court noted that the plain meaning was not clear. Thus, according to the court, it was to decide whether the interpretation given the statute by the class or by the District was more in keeping with the legislative purpose in enacting the statute. The court concluded that, viewing the statute as a whole, Congress must have intended the fee limitation to apply to the claims of attorneys representing juveniles confined in juvenile institutions. The court further concluded that the PLRA was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged a decision from the Superior Court of District of Columbia that denied his motion to suppress a firearm found in a body search. Appellant entered a conditional plea of guilty to carrying a pistol without a license, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3204 (1996); possession of an unregistered firearm, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2311 (a) (1995); and possession of unregistered ammunition, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2361.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was seen walking after curfew with two other juveniles. One juvenile was sandwiched between the other two. Appellant appeared to the arresting officer to be holding his ribs. Appellant and the others were stopped on suspicion of violating the Juvenile Curfew Act (Act), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2183 et seq. Appellant was frisked, placed against a car, and handcuffed. Thereafter, a gun was found in his clothing. The trial court denied his motion to suppress the gun, and he entered a conditional guilty plea to carrying a pistol without a license, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3204 (1996); possession of an unregistered firearm, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2311 (a) (1995); and possession of unregistered ammunition, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2361. Appellant sought review of the suppression ruling, and the court reversed. The court held that the initial stop was lawful but that frisking and handcuffing appellant violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. Walking very close to other people, displaying nervousness, and clutching one's side were insufficient factors to demonstrate an articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot (beyond the curfew violation) and that appellant was armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>

The officer had no report of criminal activity in which appellant might have been involved and saw no bulge on appellant's person indicating the possibility of a weapon.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the search was unreasonable under the circumstances. The particular facts surrounding the search and seizure did not provide the level of suspicion necessary to support the investigatory stop and search for an object inside defendant's closed fist under Terry. After the initial stop, the police tried to force open defendant's closed fist without specific and articulable facts that defendant was armed and presently dangerous.

The court affirmed the holding that appellee proved he was subjected to unwelcome harassment based on his age, and that it was so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of his employment. The court found that he was subjected to repetitive age-based slurs and the questioning of his sexual prowess and his ability to perform his job in front of both customers and subordinates.

The court found that defendant preserved his challenge to the trial court's instruction and that in the unique situation presented by the case, where the trial court was faced with a new statute, the fact that defendant did not present his own instruction to the trial court did not undermine his constitutional due process challenge to the instruction given to the jury on first degree sexual abuse. The court also found that the record indicated that defendant did not invite the constitutionally erroneous instruction and that plain error review was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative opponents challenged the Board's acceptance of the proposed prayer initiative. The proponents intervened on the side of the Board. The initiative provided, inter alia, for non-sectarian, student-initiated, voluntary prayer at school-related events. The trial court determined that the proposed measure was not a proper subject for initiative because it was patently unconstitutional. Affirming the decision, the court held that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in identifying the case as suitable for a pre-election constitutional review because the initiative raised constitutional issues on its face; and (2) the initiative violated the establishment and free exercise of religion clauses of the First Amendment. The court reasoned that the initiative had the clear purpose of fostering prayer in the public schools. The court concluded that the initiative would have placed public school teachers and principals, as agents of the District of Columbia, in the position of endorsing legislation which had the purpose of fostering prayer in the public schools, and whose primary effect was to advance the religious views of those students who lead school prayers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted him of several weapons offenses. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, because the stop of the vehicle in which he was riding, based on a violation of the Motor Vehicle Tinted Window Amendment Act of 1994, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-718.1 (Supp. 1997), was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A weapon and ammunition in appellant's possession were seized after the automobile in which appellant was a passenger was stopped for having tinted windows in violation of the Motor Vehicle Tinted Window Amendment Act of 1994 (TWA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-718.1 (Supp. 1997). Appellant contended that the TWA unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis of wealth by permitting tinting on limousines and other posh vehicles, but not on more modest vehicles. In rejecting this contention and upholding the legality of the stop, the court held that the TWA was subject only to rational basis review under U.S. Const. amend V, because wealth or the lack thereof did not create a suspect classification. The court held that it was quite easy to conceive of a rational basis for excepting limousines from the TWA, because such vehicles were often used to ferry diplomats and important government officials about the District of Columbia, and their privacy was in need of protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court held that the Motor Vehicle Tinted Window Amendment Act of 1994 was not unconstitutional, that the stop of the vehicle in which appellant was riding was therefore legal, and the evidence seized in the stop was not subject to suppression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury charged defendant with one count of carnal knowledge and one count of sodomy for his conduct with a minor. The government requested pretrial detention. The trial court ordered defendant detained based on the charges in conjunction with his prior convictions. The government contended that the appeal was moot because defendant subsequently pled guilty. The court concluded that it should consider and decide the appeal. The court held that defendant's hearing, at which he was ordered detained, did not satisfy the requirements of D.C. Code &sect; 23-1322(d) and (e). The court held that defendant was not permitted, pursuant to his proffer, to present witnesses that would have explored the nature of the offense charged and challenged the weight of the evidence. As defendant's pretrial detention hearing did not comport with statutory requirements, the trial court's detention order was not supported by the required proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, finding that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury instructions prevented consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence, thus violating defendant's due process rights. The court held that while no written requests to charge were submitted, defendant put the court on notice of his objections, thus strict plain error review was not warranted. The court held that the court was required to instruct the jury that even if it found that defendant had not shown consent by a preponderance of the evidence, the jury could consider the evidence of consent on the issue of whether the government had proven force beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 11-723 (1995) by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The issue was whether plaintiff minor's claims for negligence against defendant District of Columbia (District) and two of its employees were barred because of her failure to give the requisite notice to the District under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-309 (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor filed suit against the District alleging that she had been injured as a result of the District's failure to investigate her case and protect her from abuse and neglect. The minor suffered severe burns while in her godmother's care. The police interviewed the godmother who admitted that she did not obtain medical treatment for the minor. The minor was placed in a shelter and was hospitalized for five months. Her attorney sent a letter to the mayor describing the minor's injuries and that the District failed to investigate and protect the minor. The minor contended that the police reports filed in the wake of her physical injuries provided the District with adequate notice, under &sect; 12-309, of her claims against the District. The court disagreed finding that the police reports failed to suggest any failure by the District to intervene and take the minor out of a neglectful home environment and, therefore, did not meet the notice requirements of &sect;12-309. Further, the minor argued that the letter from her counsel tolled the statute of limitations. However, the court held that the statute did not permit equitable tolling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indictment returned against defendant charged him with possession with intent to distribute heroin. However, the actual controlled substance proven at trial was cocaine. The court reversed defendant's conviction because the difference between the indicted crime and proof at trial violated defendant's Fifth Amendment right to have been tried only for the indicted crime. In reaching that conclusion, the court determined that the difference was not a mere non-prejudicial variance, but amounted to a constructive amendment to the indictment which impermissibly broadened its scope and removed the grand jury's protection from defendant. The court reasoned that a constructive amendment occurred because an element of the indictment had been changed, from heroin to cocaine, and this allowed for a conviction based upon either a broadened factual or theoretical basis not set forth in the indictment. The court felt that a grand jury may not have had indicted defendant for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, given its different properties, schedules, and punishments from that for heroin.</SPAN></P>

The indictment set out that the controlled substance distributed by defendant was heroin. A chemical analysis performed on the substance later revealed that it was, in fact, cocaine.

Defendant's attorney opposed the motion, contending that, although the government did not have to identify the substance in the indictment, the government had in fact identified the substance and was bound by that statement. The trial court granted the motion and struck the identity of the substance. After defendant was convicted, he appealed, contending that the trial court had constructively amended his indictment. The court disagreed, finding that no amendment occurred, but nonetheless the court reversed and remanded because, on the date the opinion was issued, another case not readily distinguishable from the instant case was also decided, and in the two cases, four of the six judges in the two divisions of the court had voted for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the suspect's claims. The court held that the officers had probable cause to believe that the suspect was violating D.C.

The court also held that its conclusion regarding probable cause applied to the suspect's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim alleging that the arrest was unconstitutional, which was properly dismissed. The court agreed that the suspect failed to establish any claim of excessive force or negligence by the officers in handcuffing him because the suspect offered no evidence of regulations governing the use of handcuffs, and no expert testimony demonstrating that the officers conduct had been so excessive that it amounted to a common law tort or a violation of &sect; 1983. The court held that the suspect's claims of excessive force pursuant to &sect; 1983 and D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-176 (1994 Repl.) were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute permitting her to be detained prior to trial violated her rights under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV. The court ruled that the lack of a specified time limit in the statute did not violate defendant's due process rights so long as her detention was for legitimate regulatory purposes rather than for punitive purposes.

The court affirmed the judgment but remanded the case to vacate to felony murder conviction, finding that defendant could not have been convicted of both felony murder and the underlying offense. The court explained that the proper test for determining whether the same act or transaction constituted a violation of two different statutory provisions was whether each provision required proof of a fact that the other did not. The court reviewed the statutory definitions of murder and kidnapping, and concluded that each offense required proof of different facts and as such, merger was not appropriate. The court found the finding that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel sufficient to have supported the sentence, explaining that defendant stalked the victim before kidnapping her and murdering her.</SPAN></P>

The university students sought to vote in local Advisory Neighborhood Commission elections, and the community residents sought to stop them from doing so. The residents claimed that (1) the voter registration form did not comport with the law; it effectively permitted transients to register; (2) the Board of Elections and Ethics had an affirmative duty to scrutinize student applicants in order to ferret out those who in fact permanently resided elsewhere; and (3) the board arbitrarily refused to accept challenges to student voters at the polls, which the election statute permitted. The court rejected the residents' first two contentions, but agreed that the residents proffered enough evidence of irregularities that, depending on the results of some preliminary fact-finding, they may be entitled to evidentiary hearings on their challenges. The court referred the case to the Superior Court for hearing and fact-finding so that they would be in a position to decide, after the Superior Court reported its findings and conclusions, whether residents were entitled to any relief.</SPAN></P>

The workers' wives filed a lawsuit for lost of consortium. The trial court awarded damages to the workers and their wives. On appeal, the court determined that the manufacturer waived its objection to jury selection because it objected to the workers' peremptory challenges after the jurors were sworn. The court held that the workers were entitled to demonstrate that experts in the field were aware of the hazards of asbestos, regardless of whether the manufacturer was aware of the hazards. The court found that the trial court acted within its discretion when its admitted &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; evidence over the manufacturer's objections. Additionally, the court held that the workers' claims were not barred by the statute of limitations even though another statute of limitations was enacted after a three-year period provided by D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-301(8) began to run. Since the new statute of limitations did not specially repeal the older statute, the older statute controlled. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Public censure, however, is a less severe disposition than suspension from practice. Under the unusual circumstances here presented, and solely in order to enable the court to dispose of the case, the four judges who believe that Abrams should be suspended from practice have agreed that the sanction proposed by Judge King should be imposed. In conformity with D.C. Code &sect; 11-2502 (1995), Elliott Abrams, Esq. is publicly censured for professional misconduct.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board on Professional Responsibility (Board) recommended that respondent attorney be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. The Board concluded that the attorney engaged in dishonesty, deceit, or misrepresentation by giving false testimony to Congress. The matter was before the court on the attorney's petition for rehearing en banc after a division of the court heard the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the attorney's conviction of criminal charges arising out of his Congressional testimony, the President granted him a full and unconditional pardon. Because of that pardon, the attorney contended that his convictions and the underlying conduct were blotted out, and that the Board's charges had to be dismissed. After review, this court concluded that although the presidential pardon set aside the attorney's convictions, as well as the consequences that the law attached to those convictions, it did not require the court to close its eyes to the fact that the attorney did what he did. The pardon did not reinvest the attorney with those qualities that were essential for an attorney at law to possess or rehabilitate him in the trust and confidence of the court. The court held that its authority to impose professional discipline was not nullified by the presidential pardon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee trustee filed a lawsuit for a refund of income taxes paid to appellee District of Columbia (District) on behalf of a testamentary trust for four tax years alleging a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The trustee and the District filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted the trustee's motion as to all but one of the years in question. The District appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee and the trust's assets were located outside of the District. Neither the beneficiaries of the trust nor any of the potential remainder-persons resided in the District during the period of time at issue. The trustee paid taxes to the District on the income earned during each year in question and unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a refund. The court reversed the order of the lower court and remanded the case for an order granting summary judgment in favor of the District. The testamentary trust was a resident trust under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1890 and subject to taxation because the decedent was domiciled within the District at the time of death. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment did not prohibit taxation of the entire net income of the trust. The District's continuing, principal jurisdiction over the trust reflected a sufficient nexus between the District and the trust to justify the decision to treat the trust as a &quot;resident&quot; for tax purposes. The District established the trust when the decedent's will was probated, maintained principal supervisory jurisdiction over it, and provided access to its courts to all parties with an interest therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, and the convictions were reversed because the trial court erred in admitting into evidence police testimony regarding certain hearsay statements that defendant's mother had made to police officers.

Defendant challenged his convictions from the second trial, and the court affirmed. The court held that defendant contended that he decided to testify at the first trial as a result of the erroneous admission by the trial court of the hearsay evidence, but he could not claim that the testimony he gave at the first trial was impelled by the introduction of unlawfully procured evidence. As there was no reason to extend the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine to testimony induced by a mere evidentiary error, as distinct from unconstitutional police practices, the trial court did not err in allowing the prosecution to introduce defendant's testimony.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder while armed for killing one of his &quot;sugar daddies,&quot; by bludgeoning his victim's skull and then cutting his scrotum and ankles to be sure the victim died after bleeding to death. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in finding that the EHAC aggravating circumstance applied where the victim was not tortured, and in failing to set forth the reasons supporting its finding. The court affirmed the trial court's imposition of sentence. The court held that absent a request, &sect; 22-2404.1(c) did not require the trial court to detail for the record the reasons for its finding that the aggravating circumstance existed. The court held that the EHAC finding was proper because it was not limited to cases involving torture or unnecessary pain to the victim, but also focused on the murderer's state of mind and to society's view of the murder as compared with other murders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipality terminated an employee from a fire department position as an emergency ambulance technician based on his use of marijuana while off-duty. OEA sustained the termination; however, on review, the trial court overturned the decision, concluding that the employee had not been insubordinate within the meaning of the adverse action section of the Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act (CMPA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-617.1(d) (1992 Repl.). On appeal, the court reversed. Specifically, the court held that &sect; 1-617.1(d) did not preclude termination for off-duty drug use, and that the definition of &quot;insubordination&quot; under 34 D.C. Reg. 1865 (1987) included both failure and refusal to comply with written instructions or a direct order. Accordingly, the court concluded that OEA had a rational basis for finding that the employee had been insubordinate when he failed to comply with D.C. Fire Dept. Gen. Order No. 14 and D.C. Fire Dept. Spec. Order No. 50, which prohibited the use of illegal drugs on and off duty.

Because the Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act (CMPA), D.C.

Code Ann. &sect; 22-504(b) and argued that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-504 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court ruled that part of &sect; 22-504 was unconstitutionally vague and permitted the government to proceed only on a limited stalking charge. The government filed an interlocutory appeal. The court reversed and found that the trial court's ruling with respect to the stalking counts was an appealable order pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-104(c). The court concluded that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-504 was not unconstitutionally vague because ordinary people understood what conduct was criminalized, and &sect; 22-504 sufficiently limited the discretion of those who were responsible for enforcing it. The court also found that the stalking statute was not substantially overbroad in light of its legitimate purpose because its application was limited to conduct that was not protected by the First Amendment. The court held &sect; 22-504 was not overbroad as applied to defendant because when defendant's activities were repeated and combined with the necessary criminal intent, they were not constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant's Fifth Amendment grand jury right was not violated because: (1) the prosecutor's proof and the court's instructions encompassed conduct prohibited under the former and later obstruction of justice statute; (2) thus, there was no prejudice that would warrant reversal; (3) the same facts that formed the basis for the indictment were presented at trial, and defendant had adequate notice to allow him to prepare a defense; (4) finally, defendant was tried on the same charges set forth in the indictment.

The court held that the trial court improperly failed to apply D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2552 of the Rental Housing Act, which created a statutory presumption that put the burden upon the landlord to show by clear and convincing evidence that the purpose of the eviction was not retaliation. The trial court also erred in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that there was no retaliatory motive in the eviction when it ought to have required clear and convincing evidence to make such a finding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his conviction should be reversed because the prosecution's peremptory strikes against young jurors violated the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (DCHRA), D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant partnership challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which dismissed its lawsuit against appellee corporation. In a cross-appeal, the corporation contended that it was entitled to summary judgment regarding the contract and quantum meruit counts of the partnership's complaint and the partnership's claim for damages based on subcontracts allegedly promised to the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute between the parties arose from another dispute between the corporation and a company over a government contract. The corporation sought to settle its dispute with the company by selling some of its assets to the company. The partnership claimed that the corporation retained it to mediate the dispute and that the corporation had breached their contract. The corporation alleged the partnership was barred from bringing its suit as it did not have a real estate broker's license. The court held that D.C. Code &sect; 45-1926(c) (1990) required a plaintiff who filed a claim for compensation for effecting the sale of a business or business assets to allege that it possessed a real estate broker's license at the time of the transaction. As the partnership was engaged in an effort to effect the sale of a business, D.C. Code &sect; 45-1926 applied, and the partnership had notice of its coverage under &sect; 45-1926. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the corporation had not waived the right to raise D.C. Code &sect; 45-1926(c). As the partnership did not allege licensure under the real estate licensure act, it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a homeless individual and two street musicians, appealed their convictions in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for violating &sect; 3(b) of the District of Columbia Panhandling Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-3311 et seq. (1989). The musicians argued that their conduct did not violate the statute. The musicians and the homeless individual argued that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeless individual asked passersby for spare change, but the musicians never asked for money while playing their instruments. The homeless individual argued that &sect; 3(b) interfered with his free speech rights and violated the Fifth Amendment because it did not sufficiently specify the locations where panhandling was prohibited. The musicians argued that their conduct did not violate &sect; 3(b) and that the act was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them. The court held that &sect; 3(b) was constitutional but that the evidence was insufficient to support the musicians' convictions. Section 3(b) did not unreasonably suppress the speech of beggars who wished to communicate their plight, as it was narrow in scope, did not cut off all rights to solicit or beg, and covered all persons seeking an immediate donation of money or value, and not just beggars. The act did not violate due process, as the prohibition against begging within 15 feet of &quot;a subway station or stop&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The musicians' conduct fell within the scope of &sect; 3(b), but the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that they solicited within the forbidden 15-foot area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeless individual's conviction for violating the statute that prohibited panhandling was affirmed. The musicians' panhandling convictions were reversed because the government did not prove that they violated the statute by engaging in illegal conduct within the statutorily prescribed 15-foot area. The matter was remanded with directions to enter judgments of acquittal for the musicians.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was erroneously denied a right to a jury trial. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction of possession of cocaine. The U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a jury trial attached to &quot;serious,&quot; not &quot;petty&quot; offenses, and defendant failed his burden of rebutting the presumption that possession of cocaine under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-541(d) (1995 Supp.) which carried a six month maximum prison term was a petty offense. The court held that there was no merit to defendant's claim that his offense was serious because he was eligible for recidivist penalties because mere eligibility did not rebut the presumption. The fact that another judge for a prior offense of possession of cocaine revoked defendant's probation based upon the conviction for the latter offense did not make that latter offense serious because revocation of probation was not an additional statutory penalty attributable to the latter offense. Even though defendant could have been exposed to a one year prison sentence under 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 844(a) (1994) if charged under federal law that was not relevant because what Congress thought serious did not apply to the local criminal offense.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly admitted into evidence the clothes worn by defendant at the time of arrest. When the police officer initially saw the clothes, they were in a clear bag below defendant on his hospital gurney. Defendant had worn them in public when he entered the hospital, and the clothes, which remained under his immediate control, were in plain view. Therefore defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the clothes. They were not protected under the Fourth Amendment search and seizure provisions, nor were they inadmissible as tainted fruits of an unlawful search. Further, the court concluded that the clothes were not unlawfully seized incident to defendant's arrest. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that the show-up was unnecessarily suggestive, because the identification was found to be reliable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the police were effecting a temporary detention, designed to last only until a preliminary investigation generated probable cause or resulted in his release. The court stated that the incremental intrusion on defendant's liberty effected by the handcuffs was minimal. Even if defendant had not been placed in handcuffs, he would not have been free to leave until after the complainant had an opportunity to identify him. The time that elapsed from the time he was handcuffed until the identification procedure was completed was a few minutes.

Defendant was charged with first degree murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed, carrying a pistol without a license, possession of an unregistered firearm, and unlawful possession of ammunition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly fired a gun at a group, killing one person. As a 13-year-old, defendant had stabbed a victim and had been committed to a juvenile treatment facility. Defendant violated the conditions of his release from the facility by leaving home without consent, and his whereabouts were unknown until the killing. The trial court granted the government's motion to transfer the case, holding that the transfer was in the best interest of the public welfare and the protection of public security and that there were no reasonable prospects for defendant's rehabilitation under D.C. Code &sect; 16-2307(d) (1995 Supp.). On appeal, the court affirmed because the two-criteria approach of &sect; 16-2307(d) was met. The rebuttable presumption of &sect; 16-2307(e-2) that a child aged 15 to 18 years who had been charged with a specified offense should be transferred for criminal prosecution was not overcome by defendant. Whether there was a reasonable chance of rehabilitation was determined by applying the factors listed in &sect; 16-2307(e) (1989 Repl.): (1) age; (2) nature of the offense and previous record; (3) mental condition; (4) past treatment efforts; and (5) available rehabilitation after transfer.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the employee failed to demonstrate the employer's liability under &sect; 1983 because he failed to establish a custom or policy to penalize First Amendment expression and the single unlawful act of the employee's immediate supervisor was not attributable to the employer because he did not have final policymaking authority. However, the court held that the employee's sex discrimination claim was saved by equitable tolling principles. Although the employee did not file his complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 300 days after a woman was selected for one of the full-time positions, the employee was not placed on reasonable notice of facts supporting a claim for sex discrimination until his immediate supervisor's reasons for selecting the woman were disclosed.</SPAN></P>

The class filed a class action lawsuit, claiming that the notices were violative of D.C. Code &sect; 3-205.55 (1994). The trial court declared D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In protest of presidential Central American policies, defendant and 14 other demonstrators gathered in the Rotunda area of the United States Capitol Building praying aloud and singing. They refused to leave the Capitol when ordered to do so and were placed under arrest. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the &quot;tourist standard.&quot; The court reversed defendant's convictions and held that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the &quot;tourist standard&quot; and that government failed to prove that defendant's conduct was more disruptive or more substantial than that normally engaged in by tourists. To ensure that defendant's conviction avoided unconstitutional overbreadth, the trial court was required to adequately instruct the jury so as to accurately describe the proscribed conduct. The limitations placed on D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 9-112(b)(7)(1989) required that the trial court instruct the jury on the &quot;tourist standard.&quot; The evidence failed to show that defendant was excessively noisy, violent, armed, or disorderly, or that he intended to interfere with the processes of the Congress or any employee, visitor, or tourist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A District of Columbia trial court convicted defendant of second degree murder while armed and voluntary manslaughter while armed for charges connected with a killing during a drug transaction. The trial judge set aside the voluntary manslaughter convictions, holding they were lesser included offenses to the murder convictions, and the government appealed. The defendants appealed from the convictions and denial of motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the government's appeal, the court found that the trial court had relied on faulty law in reaching its decision to set aside the manslaughter conviction. Although manslaughter was a lesser included offense of second degree murder, D.C. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 31(c) permitted a defendant to be found guilty on an offense that was necessarily included in the offense charged. In reversing the trial court, the court held that Rule 31(c) and the case law following it implicitly overruled Craig v. United States, 523 A.2d 567(D.C. 1987), the case the trial court relied on. On the defendants' appeals, the court concentrated on the claim that the prosecution's rebuttal argument falsely stated the evidence, arguably requiring reversal of the defendants' convictions. Although the court found that the rebuttal argument did misstate the evidence presented, it considered the misstatement in terms of the gravity of the improper argument, its relationship to the issue of guilt, the effect of any corrective action by the trial judge, and the strength of the government's case. Under this analysis, the court held the misstatement was not grave enough to require reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the government's appeal, the court reversed the order setting aside the defendant's convictions on the voluntary manslaughter charge and reinstated that conviction with the second degree murder conviction. The court denied the defendant's appeals and affirmed their convictions in full.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver sued the foreign national after being injured in a traffic accident. Service of process was attempted by certified mail at various addresses, but the foreign national had since returned to Germany. The foreign national appeared through counsel and filed multiple motions to quash service and dismiss for lack of valid service, but in none of these motions did he provide his current address, as required for pleadings by D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 10-I(b). The motion to quash was granted and the driver was given a deadline in which to effect service. The driver then requested assistance from authorities in Germany and hired a locator service, but mail sent to the foreign national in Germany was returned undelivered. Although the deadline was extended several times, the trial court eventually dismissed under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 4(j) for want of diligence in effecting service of process. In reversing, the appellate court ruled that the trial court had abused its discretion in dismissing the case where the record showed that the driver had persistently attempted service, but the foreign national had concealed himself and he suffered no prejudice from the delay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant district appealed an order of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which awarded attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 to plaintiff complainants who challenged the constitutionality of statutes providing for the forfeiture of property used in connection with drug activities. Complainants appealed the failure to award attorney fees on some claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that in the complainants' challenge to the district's forfeiture statutes, the trial court had held that the forfeiture provisions constitutionally lacked probable cause hearings. The district contended that a complainant who was unsuccessful at a subsequent probable cause hearing could not be a prevailing party. The complainants contended that there were other constitutional claims upon which they were the prevailing party. The court reversed the award based on the district's claims and remanded in part on the complainants' claims. The court found that the unsuccessful probable cause complainant had not received any benefit from the litigation and could not be a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Because the record was unclear whether the complainants had successfully settled other constitutional claims, the court determined that additional consideration of attorney fees for those claims was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant murderer was convicted of killing a woman with whom he owned real property as joint tenants. Appellees, the victim's children, sought a judgment declaring that they exclusively owned the real property. The trial court granted summary judgment to the victim's children and divested the murderer of all his interest in the property under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 19-320(a) (1990). The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. The court found that under both common and statutory law the murderer's interest in the real property became a tenancy in common with the victim's children. The court ruled that &sect; 19-320(a) applied only to the future interest of the murderer, and did not diverst him of his present interest in the property. Moreover, the court ruled that a common law interpretation of the right of survivorship was necessary because Congress did not cover the right of survivorship under the predecessor statute to &sect; 19-320, and thus, did not intent to replace common law on that issue. The court then created a new common law rule that the joint tenancy held by a murder with its victim was deemed severed and converted to a tenancy in common.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) the trial court erred in holding that evidence of an intimate relationship was not required under &sect; 16-1001(5), but subject matter jurisdiction existed because the record evidence proved the existence of an intimate relationship based on the couple's engagement to be married and family bonds while sharing the same residence, (2) the ex-fiance was properly served with the petition and affidavit for the civil protection order and had notice of the trial court's hearing, (3) the proscription on an &quot;intrafamily offense&quot; under &sect; 16-1001(5) was not unconstitutionally vague, nor was the statute void for overbreadth, and (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the permanent civil protection order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district inspector observed an accumulation of trash around a dumpster at the property owner's apartment building. The inspector issued a ticket for a violation of D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 21, &sect; 700.3, a regulation issued pursuant to the Litter Control Administration Act of 1985, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2901 et seq. (1995). The ticket specified a fine of $ 50. The board upheld the fine. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that due process did not require that the property owner be given notice of the violation and an opportunity to abate the nuisance before a civil fine could be imposed. The court held that a system of comparatively modest fines imposed for violations without affording the violator of an opportunity to abate reasonably furthered the objective of an anti-litter law. The court noted that a contrary procedure would undermine the deterrent effect of the statute and regulations by allowing a property owner to litter, or fail to control litter, with impunity until caught by one of the district's limited number of inspectors. The court also held that due process did not require the district to establish scienter on the part of the property owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile filed a notice of appeal of the decision of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which granted appellee government's transfer request to transfer the juvenile to the criminal division to be tried as an adult. The juvenile argued that the transfer statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2307, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile argued the statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him in that it created an irrebuttable presumption of guilt and violated his due process right to challenge the evidence against him. The juvenile asserted that the trial judge initiated improper ex parte communications about him in another proceeding by asking another juvenile delinquent various questions about the juvenile. The juvenile asserted that the trial judge considered the information in the course of making his decision on the transfer motion and that the judge violated his judicial conduct rules as he gained personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the juvenile's proceedings. The court found that the juvenile's assertions were not supported by the record as there was no evidence that the trial judge had personal knowledge of evidentiary facts that he failed to disclose in violation of his code of conduct. Further, the juvenile's counsel had the opportunity to challenge the information the trial judge learned, but chose not to pursue the issue. The court found that though the trial judge engaged in improper ex parte communications, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the trial court's factual findings were not clearly erroneous, and the evidence presented by the government was sufficient to support defendant's conviction; (2) kicking, jabbing, and cursing at pedestrians on a street fell within the prohibition of &sect; 22-1121(1) because they were offensive actions that would tend to disturb, annoy, and interfere with the pedestrians, and such conduct was of the type likely to provoke the pedestrians and cause a breach of the peace; (3) the officer was not required to await an outbreak of violence before attempting to control the situation by making a disorderly conduct arrest; and (4) defendant's epithets and words of personal abuse did not constitute communication of information safeguarded by the First Amendment, and the state was not precluded from subjecting defendant to punishment for his disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The limited partnership purchased the structure with the plan to demolish it and develop the site as luxury condominium apartment buildings. The district in which the structure resided was designated a historical district. The Mayor's Agent determined that the limited partnership had not met its burden of proving entitlement to a demolition permit on grounds of special merit or unreasonable economic hardship. The court affirmed the Mayor's Agent's decision. The limited partnership argued that the Mayor's Agent erred by failing to weigh the historical significance of the structure with the benefits that the limited partnership's project would confer. The court stated that balancing was only required if the Mayor's Agent found that the project had special merit. Next, the limited partnership challenged the determination that it would suffer no unreasonable economic hardship. The court reasoned that a determination of unreasonable economic hardship presupposes that denial of a permit would amount to a deprivation of property without due process, and that the limited partnership did not show that the value had declined since purchase or that no other economically viable use existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Virginia imposed discipline upon the attorney for passing a bad check, disregard of local procedural rules, and knowingly making a false statement to the court. The court of appeals temporarily suspended the attorney based on discipline imposed in Virginia, and referred this matter to the board for a recommendation as to whether reciprocal discipline should have been imposed. The board recommended the imposition of 18 months suspension and the requirement that the attorney prove fitness as a condition of reinstatement. The court adopted the board's recommendation. The court stated that its function was to determine whether any serious defects were present in the foreign proceedings such as a lack of proof, a due process violation, or some other legal defect such that it would have been wrong to impose reciprocal discipline. The court found no such defect. The court however, found that the sanction imposed by Virginia, which would have been equal to disbarment was too harsh, and that an 18-month suspension, with a requirement that the attorney prove fitness as a condition to reinstatement, was the appropriate sanction.</SPAN></P>

The court then affirmed the order of commitment, finding that it was undisputed that defendant was currently incompetent to stand trial. Thus, the court found that the trial court had been required by the mandatory language of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(a) to commit defendant to a hospital for the mentally ill. The court found that so long as defendant was only committed for a reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there was a substantial chance of his attaining the capacity to stand trial in the foreseeable future, that &sect; 24-301(a) was constitutional on the facts of the case and as applied to defendant.

The lease/purchase agreement was entered into after emergency legislation was passed, which limited the mayor's ability to enter into such agreements. The trial court ruled that the lease/purchase agreement was subject to the emergency law requiring compliance with competitive bidding requirements set forth in the district's procurement laws. The trial court further ruled that the question whether there had been substantial compliance with the requirements should be decided by the Contract Appeals Board, and the trial court sua sponte dismissed the remainder of the action, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed and noted that the legislation was in effect when the mayor signed the agreement, and, therefore, it was applicable.

The court held that: (1) neither the master lease struck between the university and the owners nor an option clause included in it constituted a &quot;sale&quot; within the meaning of the Sale Act; (2) the Clarification Act did not operate to compel a different result because the Clarification Act, as a retroactive and variant interpretation of the Sale Act, was entitled to less judicial deference in its explication of the meaning of the Sale Act; and (3) the use of a three-part constitutional Contracts Clause analysis showed that retroactive application of the Clarification Act to make the master lease subject to its statutory terms would result in an unconstitutional contractual impairment.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, the trial court rejected defendant's challenge to the jury panel. Thereafter, the trial court convicted defendant of unlawful possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of &sect; 33-541(a)(1). On review, defendant contended that the United States had peremptorily challenged potential jurors on the basis of age and sex in violation of his constitutional and statutory rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that (1) defendant's contentions that the United States had peremptorily challenged potential jurors on the basis of age and sex were subject to the plain error standard of review, as defendant had failed to raise the age and sex discrimination argument with the reasonable specificity to fairly appraise the trial court; and that (2) the trial court did not commit plain error by declining to hold that they jury had been unconstitutionally selected, as age-based preemptory strikes were constitutionally permissible and the issue of sex-based preemptory strikes had not been decided in the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge (ALJ) awarded the litigant $ 20,856. The administration modified the recommended award after concluding the litigant's $ 5,000 settlement should offset the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant sustained serious, permanent injuries when the van in which she was a passenger was involved in an accident caused solely by the negligence of the driver of the van, who was uninsured. The litigant was out of work for a year. The litigant entered into a settlement agreement, which arose out of an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy, whereby the driver agreed to pay the litigant $ 5,000 where the payment was designated solely for pain and suffering resulting from the accident. The litigant filed a claim with the administration for benefits from the fund for lost wages and medical rehabilitation. The ALJ decided the $ 5,000 would not be deducted from the amount awarded. The administration then modified the award. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the administration's determination was in accord with the fund's directive to benefit only victims who would not otherwise be compensated for his or her loss pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 35-2114(a); and (2) the administration properly determined the adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court was a collateral source that had to be deducted from any potential award from the fund pursuant to D.C.

Gross Receipts Tax Amendment Act of 1987.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Long distance carriers contended that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated the Origination Clause and the Commerce Clause of the U. S. Constitution. The Act required telecommunications companies previously exempt from a gross receipts tax to pay a percentage of gross receipts received from the sale of toll communications services that originated from or terminated on telecommunications equipment located in the District and billed to a telephone there. The court held that the Act, a bill to raise revenue for the District, did not violate the Origination Clause because it did not originate in the House of Representatives. The limited exceptions for long distance carriers within the District in the Act, however, did violate the Commerce Clause because they impermissibly discriminated against interstate commerce. The District could not enact a tax scheme whereby the only companies that could fully benefit from the available exemptions were those that sold in the District only what they produced there. The same benefits had to be afforded to companies outside the District that sold within it or to a District company that sold outside the District.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insurance administration company filed a bid protest with the Contract Appeals Board (CAB) that requested CAB to cancel the bid that was granted to appellant dental plan company by appellant District of Columbia. While appellee's bid protest was pending, appellee filed an action in the trial court for a temporary restraining order, and declaratory and injunctive relief. Appellants sought review of the trial court's order in favor of appellee that preliminarily enjoined appellant dental plan company from administering the benefits program and held appellant District of Columbia in contempt for failure to comply with the injunction. The court found that the trial court had the authority to order emergency relief forcing the rebidding of a public contract while the underlying bid protest was still pending before the CAB, but that it was an extraordinary power that could only be exercised in rare instances. The court found that the particular circumstances of this case did not warrant such extraordinary action.

After the secret service determined that the development endangered the safety of the vice president of the United States, the officials refused to issue the permit. To avoid having to issue the permit, the officials enacted emergency legislation. The builder filed suit and challenged the legislation as unconstitutional. On appeal, the builder claimed that any error in the trial court's failure to apply the legislation was an invited error and that DC was absolutely barred from complaining of it. The court held that the invited error doctrine was not unbending and there was no reasonable basis for the issuance of an affirmative injunction directing Washington, D.C., to issue the building permit.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. Ann.&sect; 33-541(d) (1988), and possession of drug paraphernalia under D.C. Code Ann. Ann. &sect; 33-603(a) (1988), and that denied his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-541(d) (1988) and of possession of drug paraphernalia under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-603(a) (1988). Defendant challenged his convictions on several grounds including that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the cocaine and the crack pipe that was taken from him when he was arrested. The court rejected this argument holding that defendant failed to demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in that stairwell where he was arrested. He was not a resident of the building, nor was he present at the invitation of any of its tenants. Thus, the normal expectations of privacy enjoyed by homeowners or renters, or even their overnight guests, were not implicated. Although defendant also challenged the composition of the jury, he failed to shoulder his burden of proof on that issue. Moreover, the court ruled that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-556 (1988), allowed the admission of a chemist's report in lieu of the live testimony of the chemist who analyzed the cocaine. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia because when viewing the totality of circumstances, no reasonable person could conclude that defendant had a subjective expectation of privacy in the stairwell where he was arrested. The motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer had lost his annuity eligibility when his earnings from employment rose above the statutory limitation. The Board denied his request for reinstatement because the officer failed to show that his earning capacity again fell below the limitation. The officer contended that the Board misconstrued the Act and that, if construed in that fashion, the Act violated equal protection laws. The officer argued that once he reached the age of 50, it did not matter whether his income had fallen below the threshold level. The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the Board's decision. The court held that the Act supported the Board's decision. The Act said that if an annuitant's earning capacity was restored before age 50, payment would cease; the Act only provided two reasons for reinstatement, neither of which was met by the officer. The Act did not afford any textual support for an automatic restoration at age 50. Also, although annuitants over the age of 50 no longer had to report income, the classification was constitutionally permissible because it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tenant challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia which granted plaintiff landlord's motion to strike defendant's pleadings for failure to make rental payment into the court registry in accordance with a protective order, and that entered judgment for plaintiff. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in not granting his motion to dismiss for plaintiff's failure to serve a valid notice to vacate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord filed a complaint for possession against defendant tenant, alleging that defendant failed to vacate the property after the notice to vacate expired. Plaintiff had sent the notice to cure or vacate because defendant had failed to carry all necessary insurance. The trial court granted plaintiff's request for a protective order requiring defendant to pay rent into the court registry. When defendant failed to make the rent payments, plaintiff filed a motion to strike defendant's pleading. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint because plaintiff had failed to serve a valid notice to quit, alleging that the notice to cure or vacate did not contain the information required by D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 4302.1 (1989). The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that defendant could raise the issue of defective notice, even after entry and violation of the protective order, and that the trial court was required to determine whether the notice to cure or vacate was valid prior to striking defendant's pleadings. The court remanded to the trial court for such determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court striking the pleadings of defendant tenant and granting judgment for possession in favor of plaintiff landlord because the trial court failed to act on defendant's motion to dismiss, based on invalid notice, before granting the motion to strike. The court found that the trial court could not strike defendant's pleadings until determining whether the notice to cure or vacate was valid.</SPAN></P>

Super. Ct. Crim. R. 11(a)(2) to the misdemeanor offense of carrying a pistol without a license. Defendant contended that the gun should have been suppressed because the police lacked reasonable grounds to stop him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers observed defendant engaging in what they thought was a drug transaction. One of the officers got out of their car and identified himself as a police officer, and defendant ran. As he chased defendant, the officer observed defendant throw what looked like a pistol into a bush. After defendant was handcuffed, his pistol was retrieved from the bush. The court overruled its prior caselaw to the extent that it conflicted with the recent Supreme Court decision holding that a person who flees from a police officer's &quot;show of authority&quot; is not &quot;seized&quot; for Fourth Amendment purposes until the person either submits to that authority or is caught. The court held that defendant was not seized until after he threw his pistol away, and the pistol was therefore abandoned property. The court further held that the police conduct in arresting defendant was not illegal. Even if the officer's pursuit of him was based on a mere hunch, it did not violate the common law rule, and clearly did not violate any constitutional right justifying exclusion of the pistol. Further, the police had not committed an assault in arresting defendant.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to the maximum possible term for each count, with all but four counts running consecutively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the motions judge erred in denying his motion to reduce sentence because the sentence was so grossly disproportionate that it violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and a similarly situated defendant had received a much lighter sentence from the same judge. The court affirmed, holding that under the facts, defendant's sentence, which fell within the statutory maximum, was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of his crimes. Defendant was serving a sentence for 10 counts of offenses constituting sexual exploitation of a minor. Defendant was a junior high school teacher, who abused a position of respect and power. Moreover, he had previously been convicted of taking indecent liberties with an eight-year-old when he was a teacher in Michigan. The fact that defendant was able to point to a different sentence imposed by the same judge on a different person in similar circumstances did not change the proportionality analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government sought review of the order by the Superior Court of the District Court of Columbia, which suppressed physical evidence and a statement of defendants who were charged with carrying a pistol without a license, possessing an unregistered firearm, and unlawfully possessing ammunition. The superior court held that the police unlawfully stopped a car in which defendants were riding in when the police seized a pistol and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that the stop was not impermissibly intrusive, the physical evidence and a defendant's statement were lawfully obtained, the police had grounds for a brief investigative detention due to threatening and intimidating conduct of a defendant, and a defendant's conduct gave the officers an objective basis to have suspected there was a gun in the car. Defendants contended that the police did not have reasonable articulable suspicion of wrongdoing sufficient to stop them, and if there was a permissible Terry stop it, became an arrest without probable cause when seven officers, some with guns drawn, surrounded the car, ordered defendants out, and placed two on the ground and two against the car. The court affirmed, finding that the police had neither prior knowledge of people inside of the car, nor subsequent knowledge of defendants as a result of information obtained from a computer check before the car was stopped. The court held that a defendant did not give police suspicion he had a gun or intended to use one and the time and area of city and officer's experience were not dispositive nor in combination to have supported reasonable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 22-3102 (1989), upon which his conviction on two counts of unlawful entry was based.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Capitol Police Board Order 91.1 upon which his conviction on two counts of unlawful entry was based. Defendant had conducted demonstrations at the United States Capitol grounds for many years to protest the government's refusal to award him veterans' benefits. Defendant virtually lived under the steps of the Capitol as part of his continued protest. The court affirmed the conviction and found unpersuasive defendant's claim that Order 91.1 was constitutionality infirm facially or as applied. Given the government's substantial interest in monitoring for dangerous activities and in keeping evacuation routes clear, Order 91.1 was a reasonable time, place or manner regulation. Finally, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the defense of a bona fide belief in defendant's right to remain in the restricted area where he was arrested.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and argued that the trial court violated the spousal privilege when it permitted the prosecution to introduce confidential communication between defendant and his common-law wife, that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress statements given by defendant to the police, and erroneously permitted the constructive amendment of the indictment. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the exception to the marital privilege contained in D.C. Code Ann. &sect;14.306 for proceedings involving neglected children applied to a criminal case where the parent was accused of killing his child. The court held that because defendant, who was taken to the police station in a police car and kept there for five hours, was told he was not under arrest, the Miranda warnings were not required before questioning. The court held that the prosecution's shift from death caused by a beating with a belt to death caused by blunt head trauma did not amount to proof of facts different than those alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered a second appeal filed by the appellant individual and the appellant opponents regarding the proposed Taxpayers' Right to Know Act (Act). The appeal concerned the lower court's decision that the proposed initiative which would allow any taxpayer to appeal specific assessments of property was impermissible under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1320 (b)(1) because, if enacted, it would result in a denial of equal protection of the laws. The court reversed the portion of the lower court's order that held that the Act violated the opponents' constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. The court held that the proposed initiative was supported by a legitimate governmental interest to ensure that owners of property in the two classes pay their fair share of taxes, which could be used for the delivery of social and municipal services. Additionally, the court held that by opening the assessment appeal process to more taxpayers it would serve the important goal of citizen involvement in government. The court affirmed all other aspects of the lower court's order but it remanded the opponents' challenges, which were not addressed in the lower court's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for a felony. Although defendant was never convicted of the felony because he pled guilty to a misdemeanor, his license was automatically suspended under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 301.1, because he failed to request a hearing within five days. On appeal, defendant urged the court to reverse his conviction on the ground that the regulation on which the suspension was based violated the Fifth Amendment right of the licensee to due process of law, or because his subsequent prosecution for driving was improper as the reason advanced for suspension had turned out to be groundless. The court held that any regulation authorizing suspension had to have a direct relationship to traffic control rules designed to promote the safety of persons or property in order to justify suspension or revocation of an operator's permit. The court found that the regulation upon which the suspension was predicated was beyond the statutory power of the executive agency of the District of Columbia to issue.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that based on the record, no rational jury could have not have found that the writing in question was or purported to be of a value in excess of the statutory amount because each check was introduced into evidence. The court, after analyzing the per se rule for instructional error on the elements of the crime in both Supreme Court and federal circuit decisions, concluded that where no objection was raised at trial to the instructions as given, any such error would not be a cause for reversal where the relevant facts were so closely related that no rational jury, shown by its verdict to have found the facts necessary to convict defendant under the instructions as given, could have failed, if fully instructed on each element, to have found in addition the facts necessary to comprise the missing element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The court held that disciplinary restitution was limited to ensuring that an attorney who violated the disciplinary rules was not unjustly enriched by retaining client funds, and did not extend to compensatory damages.

The trial court imposed a sentence of 86 years to life. Defendant filed motions for reduction of sentences and for relief from illegal sentences and sentences illegally imposed. The motions judge denied the motions, noting that as to D.C. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 35(a) the sentences were not illegal, and that as to D.C. Super. Ct. Crim.

Consequently, the motions judge had no basis on which to rule that defendant's sentences were illegal under Rule 35(a).Further, the motions judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35(b) because defendant offered almost no new rationale to justify a lighter sentence. The issues raised in defendant's motion were identical to those resolved in his direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for carnal knowledge, taking indecent liberties with a minor, and enticing a minor and affirmed defendant's sentence of 86 years to life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords leased property to a commercial tenant. The tenant had difficulty paying rent and also did not pay taxes. After serving a notice of levy, the District of Columbia seized personal property in the store, changed the locks, and posted notice of an auction pursuant to the distraint statutes. The landlords argued that the District of Columbia's action cost lost rent. The superior court found that the District of Columbia violated the lease and that its acts constituted a taking. The appellate court reversed. The governmental right to authorize levy, distraint, and seizure was long recognized as a manner of collecting taxes. The District of Columbia's interpretation of its statutes was given deference and the policy of restraining property and holding auctions without a landlord's approval was a followed policy. The key was that the District of Columbia took action against the tenant, not against the landlords. It was the tenant who was obligated to pay rent and any nonpayment could not have been an unconstitutional taking imputed to the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia did not invade the private property of the landlords.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the landlords in their suit contending that a distraint for the nonpayment of taxes by a tenant was an unconstitutional taking was reversed and remanded, and the subsequent order awarding damages was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted defendant of distribution of a controlled substance, a violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-541(a)(1) (1988), after a jury trial. Defendant contended that the trial judge committed reversible error by improperly instructing the jury as to the meaning of the terms &quot;usable amount&quot; and &quot;distribute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold crack cocaine to an undercover police officer, who paid defendant with a pre-recorded $ 20 bill. Defendant was convicted of the charge. The court affirmed, holding that defense counsel had agreed to the &quot;usable amount&quot; instruction and had made no objection to the instruction defining &quot;distribute,&quot; and there was no plain error. The trial court's instruction defining &quot;usable amount&quot; was proper, as was its refusal to require the jury to find that the amount was sufficient to produce a narcotic effect. The evidence established that the substance consisted of 140 milligrams of crack cocaine, the amount of which constituted a usable amount. The $ 20 portion of crack cocaine distributed by defendant was the standard size in which crack cocaine was sold. Therefore, the amount of cocaine distributed by defendant was not so minute that proof of narcotic effect was required. Second, the term &quot;distribute&quot; meant the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another other than by administering or dispensing of a controlled substance. Thus, the trial court's instruction to the jury properly included attempted transfer within the meaning of distribution.</SPAN></P>

As part of the plea agreement, the government agreed to dismiss one original count of robbery as well as an unrelated charge. The trial judge, after denying a motion by defendant to vacate the attempted robbery charge on double jeopardy grounds, imposed consecutive sentences for the two offenses. On appeal, defendant argued that the sentence imposed by the trial court unconstitutionally subjected him to double jeopardy. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court noted that the constitutionality of defendant's consecutive sentences for conspiracy and for attempted robbery turned entirely on whether the legislature intended to authorize multiple punishments. The court held that defendant's single act constituted a violation of two different statutory provisions, therefor the offenses were not deemed the same for double jeopardy purposes as each provision required proof of a fact which the other did not. The court noted that to establish a conspiracy, the government had to prove an unlawful agreement among two or more persons. No such proof was required for attempted robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's conviction for first-degree murder was reversed and his case was remanded for a new trial, the trial court ordered him detained without bond. The court first held that its prior rejection of defendant's motion for summary reversal of the detention order did not preclude it from hearing an appeal from the detention order because the prior decision was merely an earlier motion in the same case. Collateral estoppel did not apply because the case did not involve a prior verdict and because defendant raised questions of law rather than of fact. The law of the case doctrine did not preclude the appeal because the applicability of the clear and convincing evidence standard to the assessment of flight risk was not aired and resolved on the earlier motion. The detention order was vacated because the trial court did not use the clear and convincing evidence standard in determining that defendant posed a risk of flight. To satisfy due process, and because the statute equated the detention criteria of &quot;flee or pose a danger&quot; and &quot;risk of flight or danger,&quot; risk of flight cases were governed by the same clear and convincing evidence standard that governed rulings on danger.</SPAN></P>

The government's neglect petition against the mother alleged, pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2301(9)(A), (B) (1989 Repl.), that her two children were abused and neglected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government's neglect petition was filed on evidence that the mother's children were frequently beaten with belts and extension cords that left permanent scars and that the mother had given her tacit approval to the beatings. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the cause for new proceedings before a different trial judge because the trial judge's conduct, which was clearly demonstrative of a significant level of bias, left an impermissible taint on the proceedings. The court found that there was evidence in the record to support the trial court's conclusion that the children were neglected and abused. However, the court concluded that the undue inquiry into the mother's sex life and the other statements on the record indicating a significant level of bias could not be deemed harmless. The court found that the trial judge's conduct clearly demonstrated a significant level of bias reflecting personal distaste towards the mother, which fatally tainted the trial. Finally, the court held that D.C.

The court stated that claims of selective prosecution were to be judged according to equal protection standards. The court held that appellants had made a prima facie showing of a government policy that, by its own terms, more severely punished those who exercised protected constitutional rights than those who did not.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To eliminate financial losses, the hospital planned to eliminate acute inpatient services and convert its facility to offer long-term care and short-term psychiatric services. Knowing that SHPDA had determined that the hospital's termination of services was excepted from the certificate requirement because the termination would not require capital expenditures, the association obtained an injunction from the trial court requiring the hospital to obtain a certificate before terminating services. In Case I the court held that the statute, which required administrative agreement that a proposed termination of services was excepted from the certificate requirement, established administrative procedures for reconsideration of an SHPDA decision by an administrative board of appeal. The court, not the trial court, then had jurisdiction to review a decision of the administrative board. Accordingly, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue the injunction. The court itself could not review the SHPDA decision because the association had not exhausted its administrative remedies. Accordingly, the court vacated the trial court injunction and affirmed the denial of an injunction in Case II.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary injunction order in Case I, which mandated that SHPDA require the hospital to obtain a certificate, was vacated for lack of trial court jurisdiction. The order in Case II, which denied the hospital's motion for a preliminary injunction restraining SHPDA from enforcing the certificate requirement, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants entered a restricted hallway, unfurled a banner, and began to chant a slogan, at which time they were arrested. The trial court held that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 9-112 (b)(7) (1981), which, inter alia, made it unlawful for persons to demonstrate within any of the capitol buildings, did not violate the First Amendment. The court affirmed. The court held that because the restricted area was not then open to the general public it was a nonpublic forum over which the government had the right to limit usage to its intended purposes. The express terms of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 9-112 (b)(7) imposed an absolute ban on all types of demonstrations in the capitol buildings, and the statute was therefore content neutral. The statute was reasonable because the ability of members of Congress to function efficiently in light of the nature of their work was a legitimate and identifiable goal. Defendants' activity was properly classified as a demonstration, a type of activity the statute expressly forbidden by the statute. Because the term &quot;demonstration&quot; did not include such things as conversation conducted in ordinary tones, the statute was not substantially broader than necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was ordered to pay child support for his child. The trial court ordered him to pay the guideline amount for the support. After entry of the order this court held, in a separate action, that the Superior Court of the District of Columbia had exceeded its authority in creating the guidelines by its rulemaking authority. Thereafter the Council of the District of Columbia enacted child support guidelines that were the equivalent to the earlier guidelines. D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-916.1(r) of those new guidelines provided that no child support issued under the old guidelines should be deemed invalid on the sole basis that the order was issued before the new guidelines became effective. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment affirming a hearing commissioner's award of child support to be paid by the father. The court ruled that &sect; 16-916.1(r) validated any order issued pursuant to the old guidelines and created a presumption that such orders were valid unless the order lacked a rational basis. Because the commissioner's award was not an abuse of discretion, the trial court properly affirmed it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant based his motion to dismiss the indictment on the theory that a Bureau of Traffic Adjudication (BTA) hearing on traffic citations arising from the same incident had placed him in jeopardy, so that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment shielded him from prosecution on the indictment. The trial court ruled, however, that there had been no prior jeopardy. The court affirmed the trial court's order, ruling that defendant had not yet been prosecuted for any crime arising out of the incident. The court used a two-part analysis and determined that the BTA offenses with which defendant had been charged were civil and jeopardy did not attach in the BTA proceedings. Therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar defendant's prosecution for negligent homicide. The BTA had no jurisdiction over violations of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-726, so that, assuming defendant was charged with such a violation (which was unclear), he was never placed in jeopardy with respect to it.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile was charged in a shooting death. Intervenor newspaper opposed the motion, relying upon the judicial discretion found under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2316(e) (1989) and D.C. Super. Ct. R. Governing Juvenile Proc. 53.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because the juvenile waived his right to a public trial, the protections of an accused that were at the heart of the concept of a public trial had no application, and the arguments for access by the press were significantly attenuated. The court found that the juvenile's right to anonymity trumped the media's interest in attending the proceedings. The court held that the superior court had implicitly placed the burden on the juvenile to show that the admission of the press was likely to harm him. The court found that the newspaper did not present any facts showing that, in the event of further coverage, persons would not recall or learn his identity. The court found that it was not confident that the juvenile would escape unharmed if the press was admitted. The court held that the proscription against disclosure of the juvenile's identity represented a legislative intention to authorize admission of the press only if there was reasonable assurance that the primary goal of protecting the child's anonymity could be achieved. The court held that there was no such assurance in the present case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the trial court's finding that the mother had no sexual relations with any other man during the period of conception was supported by the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.

The court also found that the alleged father waived any objection to a doctor's qualifications because his counsel said he had no objections to certification of him as an expert. The court concluded that if there was any error in the trial court's failure to admit the paternity test report of the mother's other boyfriend, it was harmless based on the determination that the other boyfriend and the mother did not have contact during the time in which the child was conceived.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the legislative history made clear that the republication requirement was designed to keep the public apprised of changes that were made to the listings of controlled substances in the schedules; (2) under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-523, the mayor was required to republish a schedule of controlled substances whenever he or she revised it by adding or subtracting a controlled substance; (3) since defendants' convictions involved controlled substances in Schedule II, which was published in 1981 and in 1985 when it was revised, their convictions were not invalidated pursuant to the republication requirement; and (4) defendants' vagueness contention was meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's principal ground on appeal was that she was denied her constitutional right to testify. Specifically, defendant asserted that she was denied her constitutional right to testify, a fundamental right that she did not waive, having told her attorney that she wanted to testify. She maintained that this was clear from the record, and that, therefore, her conviction should be reversed. The government argued that the court did not need to decide whether an attorney might waive the client's right to testify because the record revealed that defendant waived her right by not affirmatively attempting to assert her right to testify until after the jury had returned its verdict. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, and held that defendant's right to testify in a criminal trial was a fundamental and personal right which could only be waived by defendant. The trial court's failure to hold a hearing to determine whether defendant had waived her right to testify could not be deemed harmless error. The court, therefore, concluded that a remand was necessary for a hearing to determine whether defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of her right to testify.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 29-911 was constitutional and did not violate the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. The court ruled that the statute did not place a substantial burden on the observation of any central religious belief or practice. The court further found that the statute was a neutral principle of property law, grounded in ancient common law as applicable to many types of institutions. Thus, the court found that the statute was not specifically developed to subject religious institutions to discriminatory treatment. The court also held that adjudicating the suit would not impermissibly entangle the trial court in matters of religious governance because no doctrinal disputes would be involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant taxpayers failed to pay real estate taxes on an apartment building they owned, the property was sold at a tax sale. The taxpayers filed suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to set aside the sale, alleging that there had been a number of constitutional and other short-comings in the proceedings. Appellee District filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the motions judge. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged, inter alia, the constitutionality of the statutory scheme governing tax sales of real property, D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-1301, -1319 (1990), and claimed that the sale of their property was unconstitutional because the holders of mortgages on the property did not receive adequate notice. The court held that the taxpayers lacked standing to assert that claim. The court disagreed with the claim that the sale was defective because D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1301 (1990) and D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 316.2 (1984) (amended) should have been construed to require two publications in each of the two newspapers in which notice of the tax sale was published. The taxpayers failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality which attached to the publication requirements of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1301 and D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 316.2. Assuming arguendo that equal protection analysis could properly be applied to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1307 (1990), which required the District to file a report of property sold at a tax sale with the Recorder of Deeds, except in the case of property sold to the District, the District had a rational basis for the procedural distinction which it drew.</SPAN></P>

Notice of the closure was posted at least 24 hours in advance of the march and barricades were placed at the top of the stairs leading to the Supreme Court plaza.

The court disagreed and affirmed their convictions. The court held that &sect; 13k was limited to protection of the Supreme Court building and that Regulation Two contained similar limitations.

The court agreed and concluded that, as a matter of law, the father could not be said to have abandoned his &quot;opportunity interest&quot; and that, under the circumstances, the trial court should have awarded custody to the father, unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrated that such custody would have been detrimental to the &quot;best interest&quot; of his son. Because the trial court incorrectly applied a more traditional &quot;best interest&quot; test that did not begin with a presumption of custody for the father, and because the court could not properly apply the correct test on the record presented to it, the court vacated the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded with instructions to vacate the order to pay restitution imposed as a condition of probation. The action of the second judge violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, which prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.

The court concluded that defendant's motion challenging his transfer failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because D.C.

The court concluded that defendant's Eighth Amendment claims should have been dismissed on grounds of mootness because he had been transferred back to the original prison, for failure to join necessary parties such as the state or local officials responsible for the conditions at the prison, and for failure to allege the deprivation of his constitutional rights with the specificity required to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner psychiatrist sought judicial review of a decision of respondent, the District of Columbia Board of Medicine (board), which denied her application for a license to practice medicine under statutory provisions for endorsement and reciprocity. The board concluded that the requirements for licensure in Michigan at the time the psychiatrist sat for the qualifying examination were not &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to the district's standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Like the district, Michigan gave a standard qualifying exam and required a passing score of 75 percent. However, Michigan adjusted upwards the scores of some applicants, like that of the psychiatrist, who sat for the exam during the first year the state administered it. The court rejected the psychiatrist's argument that the board's reliance solely upon her unadjusted test score and refusal to consider her current qualifications violated her due process rights by creating an irrebuttable presumption of incompetence. Because the psychiatrist had never practiced without restriction in the district, she had no vested interest in a local practice. Moreover, the board's requirement of strict conformity with the district's minimum passing grade of 75 was within the board's discretion in determining substantial equivalency under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3305.7 (1988). However, the court remanded the matter to the board, finding that concerns of basic evenhanded treatment required a further explanation of how, at the time of the psychiatrist's application, the board treated applications for a license by endorsement, reciprocity, or waiver by persons from states that did not administer the exam.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrest was predicated on defendant's possession of an open can of beer on the sidewalk in the vicinity of a social club. On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued that &sect; 25-128(a) did not apply to open cans of beer on sidewalks, only on streets. After review, the court concluded that case law pertaining to and the legislative history of the &quot;open container&quot; statute revealed that it was designed to apply to all public areas, including streets. Defendant next argued that his arrest was pretextual, and that the government's evidence was obtained as a result of an arrest for a minor and unrelated misdemeanor. The court noted that the evidence indicated defendant was committing, in the officer's presence, a misdemeanor for which he could serve time in jail. The court further noted that the statute provided a legitimate basis for making the arrest, and that there was no contrary testimony. The court affirmed the conviction since it agreed with the trial judge that the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant was committing a misdemeanor in his presence, and was therefore authorized to arrest him.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 22-505(a) (1986) for assault on three supervisory employees at a juvenile facility. The trial court applied the doctrine of &quot;transferred intent&quot; to a fight between defendant and other juveniles and rejected a claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was confined in a juvenile facility and joined in a fight between two other juveniles. He kept swinging at another juvenile as facility supervisors attempted to end the fight and hit three of them in the process. The trial court applied the doctrine of transferred intent. On appeal, the court held that D.C. Code &sect; 22-505(a) (1989 Repl.) required proof of the elements of an assault together with a showing that defendant knew or should have known that the victim was a District employee charged with the supervision of juveniles. The court held that the doctrine of transferred intent applied under these facts because defendant was aware of the presence of the three juvenile supervisors and, despite that knowledge, he swung his arms and legs without caring whom he hit. The court also held that the statute was in the disjunctive, so evidence that he interfered with the employees was sufficient to convict. The court tested the constitutionality of the statute by giving it a narrow interpretation and construed its plain language to apply only to physical opposition so that it did not implicate free speech and assembly concerns.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants contended that the trial court should have instructed the jury that the &quot;tourist standard&quot; was an element of the offense charged. The court found that an explanation of the &quot;tourist standard&quot; was properly omitted from the jury instructions because it was not an element of any offense. Rather, the standard was a means of determining if a statute, as applied in a particular case, was constitutional. The government was not required to establish the constitutionality of the statute because it was not raised as a defense. The trial court did not err in denying defendants the opportunity to inform the jury about the power of jury nullification because the court did not encourage jurors to engage in such practice. Finally, the trial court properly denied defendants the opportunity to assert the defense of necessity because they could have made their views known to Congress in many ways which did not violate the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entry of judgment, the citizens sought an extension of time to submit a motion for reconsideration. The trial court granted the motion 29 days after docketing the judgment. The citizens' counsel was not advised of the order extending time until at least 30 days after the judgment was docketed. Nevertheless, counsel did not file a notice of appeal. The citizens' motion for reconsideration was denied. The citizens thereafter filed notice of appeal. The court dismissed the case, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction under D.C. App. R. 4(a)(1). The court treated the motion for reconsideration as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 59(e), which motion was not filed within 10 days as required by the rule. The court reasoned that the untimely postjudgment motion did not toll the time for appeal. The notice of appeal, which was filed 76 days after entry of judgment, was therefore untimely. The citizens were not entitled to invoke the equitable doctrine of &quot;unique circumstances&quot; to toll the appeal period because they did not fail to file notice of appeal in reliance on any action of the trial court indicating that the postjudgment motion was timely.</SPAN></P>

While the decisions of federal courts on issues of state law were not binding per se, they were persuasive authority and were entitled to great respect, particularly decisional law handed down in the same geographic area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contended that the trial court erred when it applied the standards found in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2353(b) (1989). The mother also contended that the trial court erred in failing to accord adequate weight to her visits with the child beginning 19 months after the child's birth and in placing too much emphasis on her failure to comply with a case plan. However, the court affirmed the decree of adoption because the trial judge had carefully considered all relevant factors, including those set out in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-309(b). The trial judge's use of standards relating to termination of parental rights as an analogy was not erroneous. There was clear and convincing evidence to support the conclusion that the mother's belated visits with the child did not result in a relationship so strong as to alone warrant denial of the adoption. The visits were weighed against the mother's failure to secure a stable home environment or to meet any of the child's needs. The adoptive parent, with whom the child had lived for a year, was highly qualified as an adoptive parent. There was also no error in the trial judge's consideration of the mother's noncompliance under the case plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government filed a petition for rehearing on defendant's appeal from a decision of a trial court (D.C.), which re-sentenced defendant to consecutive sentences of five to 25 years on each count of assault with intent to kill while armed, violations of D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-501, 22-3202 (1989). The trial court also stipulated that the sentences were subject to the mandatory minimum provision but not subject to good time credits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially convicted of two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and one count of assault with a dangerous weapon. On the first appeal, the court vacated the assault with a dangerous weapon conviction. The trial court re-sentenced defendant, and defendant appealed. The court held that it was error for the trial judge to rule that good time credits should not be applied to the sentence. That opinion was vacated, and the court issued another opinion. Defendant sought to have good time credit applied to his minimum sentence. He argued that unless the Council of the District of Columbia had impermissibly overruled 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4161, he was entitled to good time credits under the federal law. The court found that since the District of Columbia Good Time Credits Act of 1986 (GTCA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-428 et seq. (1989), applied only to D.C. Code offenders housed in D.C. facilities, the law was appropriately within the purview of the Council and did not conflict with the federal statute. Also, the GTCA did not conflict with 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4161 because the federal law applied good time credits only to the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the mother suffered from organic brain syndrome and could not care for her child. Therefore, the trial court found that the child was neglected under D.C. Code &sect; 16-2301 and had the child placed in shelter care. The mother appealed, but the court affirmed. D.C. Code &sect; 16-2317(c)(2) and other relevant statutory provisions did not violate the mother's due process rights by requiring the district only to prove neglect on a preponderance of the evidence. The district was not obliged to meet a higher standard because its statutory scheme for child neglect involved only temporary or supervised placement of a child, not permanent removal of the child. The medical disclosures by the two doctors who examined the mother did not violate her constitutional right to privacy. The district's interest in assuring that the mother was mentally competent to raise her child was sufficiently strong to limit the mother's privacy rights. The district did not conspire to deny the mother custody of her child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for a weapons offense, and was granted pretrial release.

Defendant sought review, arguing that the trial court erred in applying &sect; 23-1328 because he had not been convicted of the first charge. On review, the panel affirmed the trial court, and the en banc court vacated the decision of the panel. The court affirmed the findings of the panel. The court held that there was no requirement under &sect; 23-1328 that the person be guilty of the first offense or that the procedures leading to the pretrial release were free of constitutional imperfection. The court held that it was the fact of pretrial release that triggered the enhancement provision. The court held that &sect; 23-1328 did not create a separate offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants, resident alien attorneys, were denied admission without examination to the District of Columbia's bar. The court held that admission into an LL.M. program or educational training that allowed a non-ABA-approved school's candidate to take the examination did not satisfy Rule 46(c)(3)(ii). Such training or education did not mean the applicants had the requisite educational qualifications of an equivalent legal degree from an American Bar Association (ABA) approved school. The court determined that D.C. Ct. App. R. 46 did not violate the Constitution because (1) full faith and credit did not need to be extended as the admission to a bar was a matter of local policy and not a judgment on the merits of a case or controversy; (2) there existed a rational connection between the requirements for admission without examination and the substantial interest in establishing standards for the licensing of attorneys; and (3) the rule applied equally to residents and non-residents.

Defendant urged this court to overrule a case law decision in which the court rejected the contention that a specific intent to extort is a necessary element of a violation of the felony threats statute.

The court affirmed. The courts of the asylum state had no discretion under the compact to refuse rendition simply because the juvenile may have been subject to penalties in the demanding state which were not available in the asylum state. Even the possibility of capital punishment did not alter the court's holding. It was not up to appellee city to determine what constitutionally permissible penalty Alabama could impose for crimes committed within its borders. That was for Alabama's citizens to decide. The city was a party to the compact. The compact contained no exception for cases in which a reviewing state elected to exercise its right to retain the ultimate penalty in its jurisprudence. The compact contained no provision which would have permitted unilateral noncompliance by a signatory state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district contended on appeal that it had sovereign or municipal immunity from the running of the statute of limitations and from the statute of repose contained in D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-301 and 12-310 (1981) and accordingly, its claims should not have been barred. The court reversed the summary judgment, holding that the district had a common-law municipal immunity from the effects of the statutes of limitations and repose when suing in its municipal capacity to vindicate public rights. The doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi was applicable and provided the district with limited immunity in its municipal capacity in the present action because it was acting for a public right, rather than a proprietary right. The buildings affected were all public and posed a substantial threat to public health and the district was performing a governmental function by removing and abating the contamination of those affected public buildings. Accordingly, the district's action was remanded for further proceedings on all claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorists, both non-residents of the District of Columbia, were injured in separate accidents in the District caused by drivers who were without available insurance coverage. The department denied the motorists' claim for PIP benefits according to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 35-2106 (e)(2), which provided that no victim was entitled to personal injury protection benefits if, at the time of the accident resulting in injury that victim was not a resident of the District. The motorists then sought review of the department's decision contending that the exclusion of non-residents from benefits deprived them of an assortment of rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Moreover, the motorists argued that the discrimination against them on account of non-residency was inconsistent with the overall beneficial purposes of the statute. The court held that &sect; 35-2106(e)(2)'s residency requirement was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court further held that the benefits enumerated under &sect; 35-2106(e)(2) did not create a fundamental right under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the department's decision which denied the motorists' claim for PIP benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, District of Columbia (district) and officials, sought review of a declaratory judgment entered by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Tax Division that the Gross Receipts Tax Amendment Act of 1987 and the Gross Receipts Tax Amendment Emergency Act of 1987 were unconstitutional. On cross-appeal, appellee carriers requested reversal of the decision insofar as it rejected their claims of unconstitutionality on other grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a substantial reduction in taxable revenues that resulted from the new relationships which evolved among the carriers following the divestiture of a carrier, the district enacted legislation that imposed a retroactive and prospective tax on the sale of telecommunications services originating from or terminating on equipment located in the district. The court reversed the declaratory judgment that the Gross Receipts Tax Amendment Act of 1987 and the Gross Receipts Tax Amendment Emergency Act of 1987 were unconstitutional. The court held that it was barred from reaching the constitutional issues under the so-called anti-injunction statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-3307 (1987), which applied with equal force to bar suits for injunctive and declaratory relief before payment of the challenged assessment. The carriers did not meet the first prong of the test for determining whether equitable relief could be obtained against the collection of a tax because the carriers' claims of unconstitutionality were sufficiently debatable to foreclose any notion that under no circumstances could the district ultimately prevail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for assault with intent to kill while armed, in violation of D.C.

He also appealed the trial court's ruling that good time credits, under the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of &sect; 22-3202, would not apply to his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was previously remanded because the trial court's original sentence did not comply with D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3202. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 22-3202 and asserted that the trial court's imposition of a greater sentence on remand constituted double jeopardy. The court said that it had previously rejected the argument that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of &sect; 22-3202 were unconstitutional. It found that defendant's greater sentence did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because it was not imposed out of vindictiveness for defendant's successful first appeal, but to comply with the law. It did find error in the trial judge's ruling that good time credits would not apply to defendant's sentence. It said that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-434, which provided that good time credits would not apply to the minimum terms of persons sentenced under D.C. Code &sect; 22-3202, was not enacted until after defendant's crime was committed. The application of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-434 to defendant, because it increased his prison time over the law in effect at the time of his offense, was an unconstitutional ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and codefendant appealed from the judgments of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted both defendant and codefendant in a joint trial of one count of robbery in violation of D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose from three robberies by stealthy seizure or snatching in the same area on the same day. Codefendant gave a confession that the prosecution redacted for trial by eliminating defendant's name. On appeal, the court held that (1) codefendant's detention for a few minutes in a police car to obtain a speedy identification was a lawful seizure, not an arrest; (2) the confession was inadmissible as to defendant; (3) without an identification, the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of senior citizen robbery; (4) the failure of defendant to file motions for severance of the charges or parties resulted in a review limited to plain error; (5) any misjoinder of the offenses was not so prejudicial as to be plain error; (6) a redacted statement might be admitted at a joint trial when coupled with proper limiting instructions, unless a substantial risk existed that the jury would consider the statement in deciding the guilt of defendant; (7) the mere use of blanks left a substantial risk that the jury would fill in the blanks with defendant's name and violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation; and, (8) severance would have avoided the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners of a 203-unit apartment complex challenged the constitutionality of the district's Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act.

The court upheld that validity of the tenant consent requirement and rejected the contention that it constituted an improper delegation of legislative authority. Although, there was little basis for the owners' contention that the district's rent control laws constituted an unconstitutional uncompensated taking, the court remanded the case to ensure that the owners did not forfeit a constitutional claim as a result of a procedural focus by both sides on other matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a petition under the District of Columbia's URESA to collect child support payment arrearages owed by the father. She obtained proper certification from an Ohio court as to the arrearage amount and the father's obligation to provide the support, but the superior court dismissed her petition. The superior court held that the Amendment Act, which added child support arrearages to the &quot;duty to support&quot; enforceable under URESA, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 30-302(5)(A) (1988), operated prospectively only and therefore the mother could not use URESA to collect arrearages that had accumulated prior to the filing of her URESA petition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court noted that civil laws that retroactively added to the means of enforcing existing obligations were valid as long as substantive rights were not affected. The court held that the father's support obligation was a pre-existing duty that existed regardless of the Amendment Act and that &sect; 30-302(5)(A) merely provided an additional remedy under URESA for enforcing that obligation. The court found that &sect; 30-302(5)(A) could be retroactively applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the second time of the paternity case through the system, the trial court ordered a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) test on its own motion over the putative father's objection.

On the District's appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings, including the father's right to file written objections. The court determined that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2343.1(b) (1988) required a party disputing the results to file the objections in writing within 45 days of when the court mailed the results to the party and to object no less than 5 days prior to trial. The results were not received until the day of the trial, but the irregularities did not require a dismissal where 16 years had already elapsed since the birth. Certified documentation established chain of custody of the results pursuant to D.C.

The Capitol Police were previously notified about the demonstration and closed the Rotunda early in anticipation of making arrests. Defendants were arrested and convicted of unlawful entry of the Rotunda, and they appealed. The court held that the necessary factual showing of the government's need for security was not made, and thus, the invocation of the early closing regulation was not sustained, and defendants' convictions had to be reversed. The court found that there was no special event planned in the Rotunda for that day, and there was no evidence that defendants' presence disrupted either the legislative or tourism activities of the Rotunda. The court determined that the evidence did not show that a less stringent restriction on the exercise of defendants' First Amendment rights would not have achieved the same security goals as effectively, and such anticipatory security concerns did not provide the premise for curtailment of defendants' rights. The court concluded that as the security claim for closing the Rotunda was pretextual, defendants' arrests were unlawful.</SPAN></P>

The landlord had filed a claim of exemption as a small landlord.

The examiner ruled that the tenant was entitled to recover damages. After various responses and miscommunications, the RHC automatically rejected the landlord's petition for reconsideration as untimely. On review, the court affirmed the decision, dismissed the appeal, and held that the RHC's regulations required that it either grant or deny motions for reconsideration within 15 days of their receipt. If the RHC failed to act within the prescribed time limit, the motion was deemed automatically denied. Because the landlord's motion was received by the RHC on November 15, 1985, it was automatically denied on December 9, 1985, 15 business days after its receipt. Even according an additional five days for mailing, the landlord's petition was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Against the property owner's direct orders to only sell his property, the lessor rented property to a tenant. Many basic services were not provided, such as a working stove, refrigerator, and heat. When the owner discovered the tenant, he began improving the property. The tenant initiated an action for reduction in services. The RACD awarded treble damages against the lessor. The lessor appealed, arguing D.C. Code &sect; 45-1591(a) (1981) was unconstitutional as there were no clear standards in assessing treble damages and the RACD was vested with absolute discretion in making an award. The court found &sect; 45-1591(a) was previously upheld to constitutional attack and was a valid exercise of police power. Moreover, a willfulness finding was required before treble damages could be assessed. Also, under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 3410.2 (1985), where the surrounding circumstances indicated the landlord acted in good faith, treble damages were not awarded. The RACD had made such a finding in absolving the owner of treble damages, but no such finding was made as to the lessor.

Section 22-3901 allowed imposition of an enhanced penalty on a defendant who was convicted of committing certain crimes against a person 60 years of age or older. The court affirmed the sentence, finding that the senior citizen penalty enhancement statute did not violate due process because the application of &sect; 22-3901 was not dependent on the appearance of the victim, but was available to the trial judge whenever the victim was over a certain age. The court held that the age of the victim was an element of the offense that had to be alleged in the indictment and was thus a matter of proof at trial. The court held that the trial judge erred in denying defendant an opportunity to present his affirmative defense under &sect; 22-3901(c) at the time of sentencing, but the error was harmless. There was nothing in the record that the defendant's sentence would have differed had the trial judge found that defendant had reasonably believed the victim was not 60 years old when he robbed her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant and two companions, who were dressed in jogging suits, walking hurriedly from a poorly lit block that contained only condominiums and a nightclub that had a strict dress code. A number of street robberies had occurred in the area. Defendant and his companions got into a car and sped away. In response to the officer's call for backup, another officer in a marked car pulled alongside the suspect car and observed one of defendant's companions slide under the driver's seat an object that proved to be a pistol. The officer stopped the car, discovered the gun, and arrested the car's occupants. The trial court convicted defendant of carrying a pistol without a license, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court did not err either in refusing to suppress the physical evidence obtained during the investigatory stop or in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. The evidence of proximity of the pistol to defendant was sufficient to permit the jury to infer convenient access, and the location of the weapon in plain view was sufficient to infer that defendant knew of the pistol's presence.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was whether, under the Act, a general contractor that did not itself obtain compensation for an injured worker was immune from tort liability when the subcontractor that directly employed the worker did meet its statutory obligation to have provided workers compensation. The court affirmed the summary judgment. The court held that the injured District of Columbia employee could not have brought an action against the general contractor unless both the subcontractor and the general contractor had defaulted on their statutory obligations to have provided workers compensation, and the subcontractor did not default on its obligation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first contended that the trial court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by denying his request that the government produce at trial the technician who tested him to determine his blood alcohol content. Defendant wished to challenge the accuracy of the breathalyzer machine's calibration because of the difference in two test results. The trial court ruled that the technician was unqualified to interpret the test results or to testify about oxidation of alcohol in the blood stream. The court agreed that the trial court's exercise of its broad discretion to admit or exclude expert testimony was not manifestly erroneous. The court also held that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-716(b)(1) (1986) acted as a &quot;pro se&quot; statutory provision whereby defendant was guilty because his blood alcohol content was in excess of 0.10 percent. Thus, it was irrelevant whether defendant drove erratically, whether a defect in the automobile caused it to weave, or whether defendant's comprehension was clear at the time he drove. Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to consider evidence that contradicted the test results.</SPAN></P>

Almost 23 months after she reached the age of 21, the daughter filed a paternity action against the putative father. The trial court granted the putative father's motion to dismiss the complaint as time barred under &sect; 16-2342. The daughter appealed, arguing that &sect; 16-2342 was inapplicable because it did not become effective until after her 21st birthday, thereby leaving her no opportunity to sue. The daughter argued that she had a vested right in the predecessor of &sect; 16-2342, which was in effect when she reached age 18 and attained the legal capacity to sue. The court rejected that argument, noting that the Parentage and Support Proceedings Reform Act, of which &sect; 16-2342 was a part, clearly provided that its limitations period was applicable to all actions filed after the effective date of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted defendant of distribution of cocaine and enhanced his sentence, pursuant to D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for distributing cocaine while on release for a weapons offense. Although the indictment for the weapons offense was dismissed, defendant was convicted of the drug offense and his sentence was enhanced under &sect; 23-1328(a)(1). However, defendant claimed that the enhancement violated his due process rights because it imposed an additional punishment based on the weapons offense without requiring prosecution to show that there was a reasonable basis to that offense. The court first held that, for purposes of &sect; 23-1321(a), defendant had been &quot;charged&quot; with the weapons offense at the time he was arrested for distributing cocaine because the term &quot;charged&quot; simply meant a formal accusation of defendant. The court then affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the sentence enhancement did not violate defendant's rights. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that it was bound by controlling case law establishing that &sect; 23-1328 pertained only to the question of punishment and did not create a separate offense. However, the court criticized the controlling case law and noted that, if writing on a clean slate, the court's result would have been different.</SPAN></P>

On review, appellant argued that the evidence was insufficient and that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2701 (1985 Supp.) was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed the judgment, holding that there was insufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction. In support, the court found that appellant's conduct, as established at trial, was not that which was prohibited by &sect; 22-2701. The court reasoned that beckoning alone did not permit the trier of fact to find the necessary purpose beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court held that the conviction could not be sustained when the beckoning was taken together with appellant's attire and the area where he was observed. The court held that before appellant could be convicted the government had to present evidence from which a reasonable trier-of-fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had engaged in the prohibited activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner foreign government appealed from an order of respondent board of zoning adjustment denying its application to construct an antenna tower at the site of its chancery. The foreign government argued that although its application for a special exception was made under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 3108 (1982), the zoning regulations, as applied, unconstitutionally trespassed upon the field of foreign affairs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign government submitted an application to the board to construct an antenna tower at the site of its chancery for the purpose of operating a diplomatic radio station. The board denied the application on the ground that the chancery was not allowed to expand under the local zoning regulations. The foreign government appealed, arguing that although its application for a special exception was made under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 3108 (1982), the zoning regulations, as applied, unconstitutionally trespassed upon the field of foreign affairs, which was reserved exclusively to the federal government. The reviewing court concluded that the application was subject to the procedures established by the Foreign Missions Act (FMA), 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4301 et seq. (1987); D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1201 et seq. (1987), and that the board was not free to treat the application as it would the application of any other property owner. The court noted that &sect; 4301(a) stated that the permissible scope of foreign missions' activities and the location and size of their facilities were properly subject to federal jurisdiction. Thus, the board was without jurisdiction to review the application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court reversed the board's decision because it lacked jurisdiction to review the foreign government's application. The court ruled that because decisions concerning the property might have international repercussions that would directly affect United States interests abroad, the application was only subject to the provisions of the Foreign Missions Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a show-up identification without first holding an evidentiary hearing. Defendant claimed in his motion that the procedure used by the police was unduly suggestive and therefore unreliable. The government's opposition to defendant's motion revealed that an undercover officer purchased PCP-laced marijuana from defendant with a pre-recorded $ 20 bill before leaving the scene and broadcasting defendant's description and location to an awaiting arrest team. Approximately two minutes later, the arrest team located defendant and escorted him to a corner where the undercover officer identified him by a radio transmission. Defendant did not challenge the facts as stated by the government, and the trial court denied defendant's request for a suppression hearing due to the lack of a material fact dispute. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the trial court did not err in summarily denying defendant's motion to suppress because there was no material fact in dispute which, if decided in his favor, would have formed a basis for suppression of the identification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the District of Columbia, the Human Rights Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-2501, prohibited an educational institution from discriminating against any individual on the basis of his or her sexual orientation. Two student gay rights groups contended that the university violated the statutory command by refusing to grant them &quot;University Recognition&quot; together with equal access to the additional facilities and services that that status entailed. The university responded that the Free Exercise Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I protected it from official compulsion to &quot;endorse&quot; an organization that challenged its religious tenets. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the university. The student groups appealed. On rehearing, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court articulated that the Human Rights Act did not require a grant of &quot;University Recognition&quot; because, in the particular scheme at the university, that status included a religiously based &quot;endorsement&quot; of the recipient student group. However, the court found that the Human Rights Act mandated that the university make its &quot;facilities and services&quot; equally available without regard to sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A pregnant woman was terminally ill. The hospital sought an order of the court to permit it to override the decision of her medical caregivers and perform a Caesarean section. The medical caregivers requested a stay and the trial court denied their request. The court reviewed the decision and affirmed. The court held that with a viable fetus, a balancing of interests had to replace the single interest of the mother. The court found that the state's interest in preserving life usually would not override an adult's right to refuse medical treatment but the state's interest in protecting innocent third parties from an adult's decision to refuse medical treatment could override the interest in bodily integrity. The court found that the Caesarean section would not significantly have affected the mother's condition because she had, at best, two days left of sedated life; the child, on the other hand, had a chance of surviving delivery. Accordingly, the court concluded that the trial judge had not erred in subordinating the mother's right against bodily intrusion to the interests of the unborn child and the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On separate occasions, police officers saw defendants and co-defendant waving and calling out to adult male occupants of automobiles and male pedestrians in an area known for a high incidence of prostitution and prostitution-related activities. Each was arrested, tried, and convicted under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2701 (Supp. 1985). On appeal, defendants and co-defendant sought reversal of their convictions on the ground that the state presented insufficient evidence to convict them. In addition, co-defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of an expert at her trial. The court reversed all the convictions. The court held that the evidence in each trial was insufficient because it did not include a crucial element of the offense, namely, that defendants and co-defendant offered or agreed to engage in a sexual act in return for a fee. Moreover, an expert's testimony was erroneously admitted in co-defendant's trial because the testimony was not probative of any material fact that had not already been established by other evidence. The trial court was instructed to enter judgments of acquittal on remand because the Double Jeopardy Clause barred a retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant applied for a renewal of a retailer's liquor license. The Board denied the application under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 25-111(a) (1987) and found that the restaurant was not &quot;appropriate&quot; for the neighborhood. The restaurant sought review and contended that the Board's findings were motivated by unconstitutional considerations of race. The restaurant also contended that the finding of appropriateness was inapplicable to license renewals. The court held that a finding of appropriateness was required for applicants for issuance, transfer, or renewal of a license, under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 25-115(b)(1) (1987). The court determined that the previous statute and the current statute applied to license renewal as well as to issuance. The court found that, when a statute was ambiguous, it was permitted to look at its legislative history to determine whether Congress intended its criteria to apply to license renewals.

The district issued a notice of filing, but subsequently revoked the notice because the titleholders failed to meet the requirements of the Condominium and Cooperative Stabilization Act of 1979 (1979 Act). The district then passed the Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act of 1980 (1980 Act), which placed greater restrictions on condominium conversions. The titleholders filed suit to challenge the Act and the district's rejection of its application. The trial court granted summary judgment to the district. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding (1) the district's revocation of the notice of filing was not improper, (2) the provision of the 1980 Act that vested authority in the tenants to veto any proposed conversion was unconstitutional because it improperly delegated to private citizens a power granted by Congress to the District Council, and (3) there were issues of fact as to whether the 1980 Act effected a taking of the titleholders' property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the trial court (District of Columbia), which denied his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty to kidnapping under the provisions of D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to a kidnapping charge; however, a few days later and prior to sentencing, he moved to withdraw the plea under D.C. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(e) based on a &quot;fair and just&quot; standard. Defendant asserted that his participation in the kidnapping was in fact coerced by his violent codefendant. The trial judge denied the request to withdraw the plea, and the court reversed. The court noted that defendant moved to withdraw the plea almost immediately after its entry, and the trial court abused its discretion in denying the request for a withdrawal. The court balanced such convincing factors as defendant's repeated assertions of his innocence and the insistence of a coercion defense. Moreover, the court noted defense counsel's uncontradicted testimony on the question of whether the guilty plea was voluntary given the coercion circumstances. Finally, the court determined that the government could not show that undue delay either cast doubt on defendant's reasons for his failure to raise the coercion defense earlier, and that the government was not prejudiced in any way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Defendant was allowed the opportunity to present his asserted coercion defense before a jury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment on each count, and sought review on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient, the marijuana convictions merged, and that the paraphernalia conviction was illegal because the trial court never entered a finding of guilt on the drug paraphernalia charge. The court held that: (1) the sentence on the drug paraphernalia charge was void ab initio; (2) the two marijuana charges were violations of the same statute, D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court invalidated the warrant after concluding that under D.C.

The trial court further concluded that the &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the suppression of unlawfully seized evidence was inapplicable. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order suppressing the evidence to the extent that it concluded that the park police lacked statutory authority to be issued the search warrant because the plain language of &sect; 33-565(e) did not authorize the issuance of narcotics search warrants to the park police. However, the court vacated the order of suppression because the good faith exception had not been clearly decided where it was uncertain whether the trial court concluded that the park police's reliance on the warrant was not objectively reasonable. The court found that substantial questions about the reasonableness of the park police's assertion of authority remained because the record did not indicate whether a challenge to the authority came prior to the issuance of the warrant or from what source the challenge emanated.</SPAN></P>

After a suppression hearing, the trial court ruled that defendant had been lawfully arrested for a misdemeanor and that the search was a proper one, incidental to the arrest. On appeal, the court found that, pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-627, it was reasonable for the officers to stop defendant, discover his name, and issue a ticket for the civil infraction. However, the court agreed with defendant that it was not reasonable, under the statute, or within the strictures of the Fourth Amendment, for the officers to effect a full custody arrest accompanied by a body search.</SPAN></P>

A codefendant was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to simple assault in violation of &sect; 22-106 for attempting to help the first defendant conceal the actual events behind the crime. The first defendant challenged a number of pretrial rulings by the lower court, including the lower court's denial of defendant's motions to suppress oral and written statements, as well as physical evidence, allegedly obtained in violation of defendant's fourth and fifth amendment rights. The appellate court found that although defendant's rights were violated, the evidence adduced in the case was so overwhelmingly in support of defendant's guilt, that the constitutional violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and it affirmed that conviction. The appellate court vacated the mayhem conviction because defendant's conviction for mayhem should have merged into his conviction for second-degree murder.

Code Ann. &sect; 22-2701.1(1) (1986 Supp.) rendered the statute under which he was convicted unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the term &quot;fee&quot; as used in &sect; 22-2701.1(1) (1986 Supp.) was not limited to require &quot;payment for professional services&quot; in the form of money. The court further found that the definition of prostitution in &sect; 22-2701.1(1) encompassed defendant's offer to exchange his gold necklace to an undercover police officer for sexual acts. The court determined that sufficient evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the gold necklace had some value. The court concluded that defendant did not have standing to raise an overbreadth claim and that his vagueness claim failed because D.C.

Defendant petitioned for rehearing en banc. The court affirmed. At defendant's first trial, defendant was convicted of first degree murder but found not guilty on the second degree murder charges. In defendant's second and third trials, he was retired only on those counts of the original indictment on which the jury had returned guilty verdicts. At defendant's third trial, the jury was instructed to consider the lesser-included offense of second degree murder while armed. Defendant's conviction for second degree murder could be upheld because defendant had waived his right to raise the issue of double jeopardy. Defendant could not have been surprised by the government's request for the lesser-included instruction at his third trial because the government had made the same request at his second trial. Giving this instruction over defendant's objection was not error; it was reasonable under the circumstances to invoke the common law rule that malice, required for the second degree murder conviction, was an essential element in a felony murder.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1-205(b) (1981), which authorized voter initiatives, did not provide for presentment to the President for signature, the mandatory minimum sentence statute was invalid. The court affirmed the sentence. Although the congressional oversight provisions of &sect; 1-205(b) were unconstitutional, they were severable from the charter amendment powers conferred upon the District of Columbia Council and the electorate by &sect; 1-205(a). Legislative history revealed little discussion of, and no particular emphasis on, the two-house approval requirement, and it was certainly not evident that the approval requirement of charter amendments was so important that the amendment powers would not otherwise have been granted. Severing the unconstitutional charter amendment oversight provisions from &sect; 1-205 was consistent with congressional intent to provide effective home rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child contracted gonorrhea at the age of 4 1/2, she was committed to Department of Human Services' custody upon her mother's stipulation that she was neglected. After her first 3 1/2 year placement, she was placed with a new foster parent with a plan that this placement would be a permanent adoptive home. In its ruling, the trial court first focused on the child and her current condition, then made detailed findings about the mother and her relationship with her daughter. The mother still needed therapy and did not understand her child's problems. The foster home was then considered, along with the fact that continuation of the mother's rights would require a new placement. On appeal, the court held that the statute did not facially violate due process. The &quot;best interests of the child&quot; standard did not offend the constitutional rights of natural parents. Under the statute, a finding of parental unfitness was not required by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Because the trial court had applied the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; test without making a direct comparison of the natural parent and the foster home, the statute was not unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a cocaine addict, pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute heroin. The trial court, pursuant to the mandatory minimum sentencing provision under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-541(c)(1) (1986 Supp.), sentenced him to a prison term of 4 to 12 years. Upon review the court affirmed the sentence. The court held that defendant was ineligible for a waiver of the mandatory minimum sentencing requirement under the addict exception, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-541(c)(2) (1986 Supp.). The court found that &quot;addict&quot; as defined in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-501(24) (1986 Supp.) did not include cocaine addicts, and in fact, cocaine addicts were specifically excluded from the definition pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-501(15) (1986 Supp.). The court determined that thus, the trial court was not empowered to invoke the addict exception to the mandatory minimum sentencing requirement. The court held that the distinction between cocaine addicts and narcotic drug addicts did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because at the time the addict exception was enacted, cocaine was not considered to be pharmacologically addictive. Hence, there was a rational basis for excluding cocaine users.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was criminally indicted for shooting an individual while working off-duty. The officer's union initially agreed to pay for an attorney to defend him in the criminal action.

The officer brought an action against the union. The board concluded that the union had violated standards of conduct for labor organizations when it rescinded its decision to pay for legal counsel. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the board. The court held that in view of the unambiguously expressed intent of D.C.

Defendants were convicted of &quot;inviting for purposes of prostitution&quot; under &sect; 22-2701. On appeal, the court reversed with instructions to enter judgments of acquittal. The court held that the trial court erred as a matter of law in permitting the government to introduce defendants' prior convictions of commercial sexual solicitation in the government's case-in-chief. The court then found that when other crimes evidence was eliminated, the government failed to prove the fourth element, &quot;in return for a fee,&quot; as to either defendant.

The court noted that the arresting officers testified that at the time they arrested defendant they could see her buttocks and back, the sides of her body, including the sides of her breasts, but that they could not see her genitalia or the front of her breasts. They also testified that defendant did not make any lewd or obscene gestures. The prosecution did not call any other witnesses.

The president was scheduled to give his state of the union address that evening, however, so the building's closing time was moved up to allow for security sweeps. When the building closed, 158 people refused to leave and were arrested. By a prior agreement with the prosecutor, most agreed to post and forfeit $ 10 collateral on a charge of unlawful assembly. Five of the activists, including defendants, chose to stand trial, and they were charged with and convicted of unlawful entry. In affirming, the appellate court ruled that the early closing of the Capitol for security purposes was a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction and did not violate defendants' First Amendment rights. Moreover, the First Amendment issue was not a question for the jury, but was a question of law for the court to decide. The defenses of necessity and good faith belief were not applicable and prosecutorial vindictiveness was not shown by the decision to charge defendants with the more serious offense of unlawful entry when they chose not to accept the unlawful assembly charge.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court reversed. The court held defendant's motion to withdraw his plea was improperly denied where he gave cryptic responses to the trial judge's questions regarding his guilt during the hearing conducted pursuant to D.C.

The court found during the plea entering proceeding, defendant indicated he unwillingly engaged in the kidnapping and the trial court had a duty to investigate further. In addition, the court concluded the motion to withdraw the guilty plea should have been granted on the ground that withdrawal was fair and just under the circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence. Police officers obtained a search warrant for a two-story townhouse. When they executed the warrant, they searched defendant, who was one of the five persons in the house. He had five bags of heroin on him. An officer testified that when the police knocked and announced themselves at the front door, the backdoor immediately flew open, and defendant was standing in the doorway. Upon review, the court found that the fact that defendant was one of five persons in the house at the time of the search was not sufficient to give the police probable cause that he was committing an crime or concealing property that they were entitled to seize. However, the court found that there was testimony in the record that would have supported a finding that defendant was attempting to flee when the police knocked and announced their purpose, which might have given the police probable cause to search defendant. The court concluded that the trial court had to resolve the conflicts in the testimony, including the question of whether defendant attempted to flee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant again sought review, asserting error at the second sentencing proceeding. At issue was whether defendant was the same person as the one earlier convicted of the enhancing offenses. Defendant claimed that the trial judge violated his Fifth Amendment rights by using as evidence against him his refusal to testify under oath at the sentencing hearing. He argued that the government failed to prove his identity, and that double jeopardy barred another resentencing in his case. On appeal, the court accepted his first two contentions, but rejected his third and again remanded for resentencing. The court held that when the trial judge imposed the enhanced sentence based on a certified copy of prior convictions and defendant's refusal to be sworn to deny the felony convictions, he committed an error of constitutional dimensions, and the sentence imposed could not stand. The court ruled that the prosecution did not meet its burden of proving the identity of defendant in the felony conviction records produced. The court found that while the trial judge's actions had the effect an erroneous ruling excluding evidence, the illegal sentence imposed on defendant could be corrected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate defendant's sentence previously imposed, and instead to impose a sentence no greater than the maximum authorized by statute. The court determined that if defendant proved by a preponderance of the evidence constitutional infirmities in the previous convictions, the sentences for the present offenses could not be enhanced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which denied his D.C.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-3202, to -3812 (1981 &amp; 1985 Supp.) and unauthorized use of a vehicle pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3815 (1985 Supp.) and given a consecutive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of grand larceny while armed and of unauthorized use of a vehicle. Defendant appealed and a division of the court rejected defendant's contention of merger of the sentences and affirmed his convictions in an unpublished opinion. Subsequently, another division reached the opposite conclusion on indistinguishable facts and held that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibited separate convictions for grand larceny and unauthorized use of a vehicle arising out of the same transaction. Defendant returned to the trial court and unsuccessfully argued that his unauthorized use conviction should have been vacated. Defendant appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that because the subsequent contrary decision was fully retroactive, the trial court should have granted defendant's D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-110 motion to vacate an unconstitutional conviction and sentence. The court also held that its prior rejection of the same argument on direct appeal did not bar the present division from affording defendant his requested relief in light of the intervening caselaw.</SPAN></P>

The bar filed a petition appealing the denial of the reissuance application by the board. After review, the court affirmed the board's order. The court held that &sect; 25-115(a)(6) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the bar's application. The statute provided criteria for the issuance of the license and the regulatory context gave concreteness to the general terms of the statute. The regulatory context and judicial and administrative interpretations of &sect; 25-115(a)(6) gave the bar fair warning of what was proscribed under the statutory standard. The language of &sect; 25-115(a)(6) provided ample statutory support for the board's consideration of problems emanating from the bar and traceable to its patrons outside the establishment in determining whether it was appropriate for reissuance of a license.

The trial court found that the fire originated in the heating system, the repair firm's employees' negligence was the proximate cause of the fire, and the failure of a component of the heating system to operate as designed was a contributing cause. The trial court granted the manufacturer's motion to dismiss the repair firm's complaint. The repair firm claimed that the trial court erroneously afforded the protection of D.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted her, after a bench trial, of sexual solicitation in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-2701 (1984 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction for sexual solicitation, and that D.C. Code &sect; 22-2701 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence adduced was sufficient for conviction, and that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The government proffered evidence sufficient for a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Having reviewed the record, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge's finding that the government's proof of defendant's purpose was adequate. The statute did not encourage arbitrary enforcement because the specific listing of conduct and the purpose requirement provided more than &quot;minimal guidelines&quot; to law enforcement officers. Because the District of Columbia solicitation statute required that conduct be for the purpose of prostitution and because it provided that objective criteria had to be present in order to support a conviction, it was not void for vagueness. The court found no error, therefore, in the trial court's denial of defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss the information by reason of the asserted vagueness of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for sexual solicitation contending that &sect; 22-2701 violated the First Amendment by prohibiting speech which proposed entirely lawful conduct and, alternatively, that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence. The court rejected both contentions and affirmed the conviction. The court concluded that the speech, soliciting for the purpose of prostitution, concerned unlawful activity, and any sexual act which could have been performed by a prostitute was proscribed by &sect;&sect; 22-301, 22-1002, and 22-3502. The court held that soliciting for the purpose of prostitution was not entitled to First Amendment protection. The court concluded that &sect; 22-2701 was nevertheless constitutional because it directly advanced a substantial governmental interest and was narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The court found that the arresting officer had probable cause to believe defendant had committed a crime having made more than 100 arrests for sexual solicitation and having observed defendant for 45 minutes prior to arresting her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife brought an action for false arrest, negligence, and a violation of civil rights. The court reversed a portion of the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment on the false arrest claims. The officer did not have probable cause as a matter of law to arrest the husband because there were material questions of fact as to whether the assault was justified. The District was potentially liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Second, the court held that the trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment on the wife's negligence claim because there was no special relationship between the wife and the police, so there was no duty owed to the wife. Third, the court held that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. Summary judgment for the officer was improper because there was no probable cause as a matter of law for the arrest. Regarding the District, there was a material question of fact as to whether its policy deprived the husband of a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was sitting in a marked police car in a high crime area when he observed defendant and his companion acting suspicious in from of a male clothing store. Defendant stayed outside the store while his companion appeared to be casing the store. The officer approached defendant and asked him to remove his hands from his pockets. Defendant informed the officer that he was just wasting time and that he had previously been arrested for armed robbery. The officer testified that he observed a bulge in the stomach area of defendant's windbreaker that looked unusual. The officer touched the bulge and though it felt like a gun. The officer then removed a revolver from defendant's jacket. The trial court concluded that the facts did not justify a suspicion to stop defendant and conduct a search. The court determined that defendant's presence outside of the store in a high crime area was insufficient to justify an investigative seizure. However, the court found that such activities, coupled with the fact that defendant had previously been armed, justified a Terry stop. Accordingly, the trial court erred by suppressing the gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the putative father of respondent mother's son, challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that, in the mother's suit to establish paternity and to compel the father to provide support, denied the father's demand for a jury trial. The mother cross-appealed the trial court's refusal to admit the results of a human leukocyte antigen test into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that, as amended, the statute's applicable to paternity proceedings, D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-1101 (11), 16-2341-2348 (1981), omitted the prior references to a defendant's right to a jury trial. In affirming the trial court's order that struck the father's demand for a jury trial, the court rejected the father's claim that, notwithstanding the statutory silence on the question, it was still possible to interpret the relevant sections as providing for a right to jury trial because a contrary interpretation rendered the statute unconstitutional as violative of the Seventh Amendment. The court ruled that the amended statutes treated paternity proceedings as purely civil proceedings, rather than as quasi-criminal actions under the old statutes, and thus the right to a jury trial, and other criminal due process safeguards, were no longer required and were thus omitted. Moreover, the court ruled, because paternity actions were equitable in nature and because a jury trial was not available in actions at equity, the Seventh Amendment was not violated. In light of the mother's success on the merits of the case, the court did not rule on the mother's cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that denied the father's request for a jury trial in the mother's paternity action.
