</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of causing a homicide and causing great bodily injury by the negligent use of a motor vehicle. Defendant caused a multiple-car accident, killing two people, and was found slumped over the steering wheel. A factual issue at trial was whether defendant had fallen asleep while driving or had looked away from the road while changing the radio station. Defendant contended that he had no warnings and that his conduct was ordinary negligence, not criminal behavior. On appeal, the court held that an objective standard for criminal negligence was applicable, and the fact that defendant went left of center was sufficient for the jury to conclude defendant was criminally negligent. In addition, the jury did not need to unanimously agree about why the defendant committed the negligent act, as sleep was not a legal defense. The criminally negligent act, and also the critical issue, was the jury's conclusion that defendant crossed the highway's centerline. Therefore, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions because the evidence was sufficient as an objective, not subjective, standard for criminal negligence was applicable, and the fact that defendant went left of center was sufficient for the jury to conclude defendant was criminally negligent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) after a jury convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. The defendant also appealed an order finding that he improperly refused to provide a breath sample under Wisconsin's Implied Consent Law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. At the police station, a breath test was administered to the defendant, but the report showed a deficient sample because the defendant did not blow enough air into the machine. A refusal hearing was held, and the trial court found the defendant improperly refused the breath test. The case proceeded and a jury found the defendant guilty. On appeal, the court rejected the defendant's claim that he was entitled to a twelve-person jury because he did not object to the six-person jury during trial. Although the arrest occurred in city limits, the court determined that the county sheriff had legal authority to arrest the defendant because the city was located in the county where the sheriff had jurisdiction. The court also held that the trial court did not erroneously exercise its discretion in ruling there was a sufficient foundation to qualify the officer who administered the breath test as a expert witness. Finally, the court held that the deficient sample of the breath test was admissible because it was not a test result or hearsay. The trial court's judgment and order were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment entered after a jury convicted the defendant was affirmed because the defendant did not object to the six-person jury at trial, and the county sheriff had jurisdiction to make the arrest. The trial court's order finding that the defendant improperly refused to provide a breath sample was also affirmed because the trial court did not erroneously abuse its discretion in making its finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases consolidated for review, appellants sought review of Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin) convictions of violating Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.63(1), 346.65(2)(c), and 346.65(f). These statutes prohibited, as a felony, the operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated and the operation of a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration, as a third offense and with a minor passenger under the age of sixteen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, appellants were convicted of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and with a prohibited alcohol concentration, as third offenders and with a passenger under the age of sixteen, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.63, 346.65(2)(c), and 346.65(2)(f). Appellate court affirmed. These two statutes, when applied in concert, were not ambiguous because the plain language clearly defined the elements of the felony. The elements listed were the only ones that the prosecution had to prove, thus the statutory scheme did not shift the burden of persuasion of an element of the crime to the offender. In addition, the argument that appellants were deprived of equal protection failed because, under the rational relationship test, Wisconsin had an interest in protecting children that provided a basis for the additional penalty. Furthermore, appellants were not actively misled by police's &quot;Informing the Accused&quot; form merely because it did not include the felony they were convicted of in its list of penalties. Lastly, reasonable suspicion existed for the investigatory stop of the first appellant's vehicle and officer justifiably permitted to conduct field sobriety tests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Felony convictions of the operation of a vehicle while intoxicated and with a prohibited alcohol concentration, as a third offense, with a passenger under the age of sixteen affirmed. Appellants were not denied procedural due process, nor were they deprived of unequal protection of the law. They were not actively misled by police and after investigatory stop of first appellant's vehicle, officer justified in conducting sobriety tests.</SPAN></P>

The jury answered the question whether defendant hospital's negligence was the cause of plaintiff husband's injuries in the negative, with two different jurors dissenting. The lower court thereafter dismissed plaintiffs' action, finding that the jury's verdict satisfied the five-sixths rule of Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.09(2). The appellate court affirmed the lower court decision. The court found that the five-sixths rule applied not only to claims, but also to defenses. Thus, when 10 of 12 jurors agreed to a question that disposed of plaintiff's claim, the rule was satisfied. The court held that plaintiffs' claim could not stand, because 10 of 12 jurors agreed that defendant hospital's negligence was not causal, and absent causation, plaintiffs did not have a claim for negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent appealed from a ch. 980 commitment order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment, based upon a jury verdict, finding him to be a sexually violent person and committed him to a secured facility for treatment. Initially, the state of Wisconsin had filed a petition alleging that respondent was a sexually violent person eligible for commitment under ch. 980.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition alleging that respondent was a sexually violent person eligible for commitment under ch. 980. During a jury trial, expert witnesses gave testimony that defined the substantial probability standard as being &quot;more likely than not&quot; that respondent would engage in acts of sexual violence. The jury found that respondent was a sexually violent person, and the trial court entered the ch. 980 commitment order. On appeal, respondent claimed that ch. 980 was unconstitutionally applied to him on several grounds, all of which the court rejected. Respondent argued that the trial court failed to properly define the substantial probability standard as it should have been defined to mean &quot;extremely likely.&quot; Instead, the court found that the trial court's failure to define the term was not error as standard jury instructions were given and the jury was free to disregard the lower standard of that definition as asserted by the expert witnesses. Respondent also waived his right to review the issue because his counsel had used the experts' definition in his case and the court also found that there was sufficient evidence to support the commitment. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which adjudicated him delinquent for committing first-degree sexual assault of a child, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(1), arguing that his motion requesting the suppression of two inculpatory statements should have been granted and that he was denied his constitutional due process right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile's motion to suppress his first confession to police in regards to a charge of sexual assault on a minor should have been granted. Appellant was awakened in the middle of the night and questioned in the back of a police car and was not advised of his Miranda rights before appellant admitted the assault. The trial court erred in failing to apply the correct legal test of whether a reasonable person of appellant's age in appellant's circumstances would have believed he was in custody. However, admission of appellant's second statement to police made later at the police station was proper because he voluntarily repeated his confession after being fully informed of and waiving his Miranda rights. Following the denial of appellant's suppression motion, trial was to the court based on stipulated facts. Appellant asserted that he should have been accorded a jury trial. However, juveniles involved in delinquency proceedings were not entitled to a jury where the juvenile adjudicated delinquent was not subject to placement in an adult prison. Other issues raised for the first time on appeal the court declined to review and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for sexual assault on a minor was upheld because the denial of appellant's suppression motion as to his confession after receiving Miranda warnings was proper even though appellant's motion as to suppression of his first statement should have been granted for lack of Miranda warnings. Appellant was not entitled to a jury trial where a delinquency adjudication would not subject him to placement in an adult prison.</SPAN></P>

The appellant commission's appeal focused its argument on the court's property-right conclusion. The reviewing court held that any consideration of whether respondent had a constitutionally protected interest was premature and should not have been reached by the circuit court. The circuit court's ruling, with respect to respondent's constitutional argument, constituted obiter dicta and did not have legal or procedural effect. Therefore, the reviewing court affirmed the order insofar as it remanded the case to the commission for further hearings on the waiver/consent issue but reversed as to the premature ruling on the property interest claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to aggravated battery with intent to cause substantial bodily harm as a gang-related offense and was convicted and placed on probation for ten years. The court imposed as a condition of probation a prohibition on defendant's having contact with gang members. Defendant challenged the probation condition, asserting that it was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed the probation condition because the definition of gang members set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 939.22(9), (9g), and 941.38(1)(b) were sufficiently specific to provide defendant with fair and adequate notice as to his expected course of conduct. The court held that the statutes provided an ascertainable standard for enforcement because the statutory definitions would not permit a violation to be found on individualized or arbitrary standards as to what constituted a gang member. The court found that the probation condition was not overbroad because it applied only to current gang members and to persons the defendant reasonably could be expected to know were members of a gang.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a). At trial, defendant moved to suppress the chemical test result obtained under Wisconsin's Implied Consent Law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305, claiming that the test result violated his constitutional due process right to make an informed choice to either take or refuse the chemical test. His motion was denied. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. A prior decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which was binding on the court, held that the right to refuse a blood alcohol test was simply a matter of statutory privilege and that the information required to be given drivers by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) satisfied due process requirements. Further, a Wisconsin driver had no choice with respect to granting his consent to take the chemical test. He was deemed by law to have already consented to submit to a test upon applying for and accepting a driver's license. Informing a Wisconsin driver that he might lose his driving privileges by refusing a chemical test was sufficient to satisfy due process under the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lobbyist was investigated by defendants for possible violations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 13.625(1)(c), which prohibited lobbyists from making contributions to incumbents and candidates for partisan elective state office, except during a specified period preceding general elections. Plaintiff lobbyist's wife was not a lobbyist, but made several contributions to incumbents. Defendants issued subpoenas to plaintiffs requiring them to appear for a deposition and bring with them copies of checks issued for political contributions and check registers. Plaintiffs filed this action, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the board erred in interpretation of &sect; 13.625(1)(c), asserting that the statute did not restrict plaintiff wife's contributions, and the investigation of plaintiff wife violated her constitutional rights. The lower court granted relief to plaintiffs, and defendants appealed. This court affirmed, holding that the lower court properly interpreted the statute to not apply to a political contribution made by a plaintiff wife from marital funds because the statute only prohibited activities by plaintiff lobbyist, not his wife.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, however, properly questioned the equivocal feelings of the venirepersons, who determined that they would be able to serve without prejudice. He also waived any objection to the venirepersons against whom he exercised preemptory challenges by not specifically naming them for review of impartiality. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting expert witness testimony based in part upon an improperly viewed presentence investigation report because the trial court's retroactive release of the report cured any error. Nor did the trial court err in admitting expert testimony based upon certain scientific conclusions because the validity of the expert's opinion did not affect its admissibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer was charged with violation of six general orders of the police department related to investigation of a crime. It was undisputed that plaintiff made false statements during a department's interview regarding the incident.

Plaintiff alleged that defendant did not have just cause under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.13(5)(em) for the imposed discipline and that defendant's decision to terminate his employment was unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by evidence. He also argued that defendant erred when it denied his motion to suppress based on the department's failure to provide him with warnings during his interview, pursuant to Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 17 L. Ed. 2d 562, 87 S. Ct. 616 (1967).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which adjudged respondent a sexually violent person and committed him to a secured facility for treatment, on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to support the commitment and that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 was unconstitutionally applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that the testimony of two doctors was sufficient evidence to sustain the commitment order and that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 was not constitutionally infirm, the court affirmed the order. The court held that in order to commit respondent, the state had to prove under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.02(2) that respondent had been convicted of a sexually violent offense, suffered from a mental disorder that predisposed him to engage in acts of sexual violence, and was dangerous to others because he had a mental disorder which created a substantial probability that he would engage in acts of sexual violence. The court noted the testimony of respondent's sexual sadism and antisocial personality disorder, and held that credibility determinations were for the trial court. The court held that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 did not violate double jeopardy or ex post facto safeguards because it was a civil, not criminal, proceeding imposing no punishment. The court also held that it, therefore, did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court further held that the fact that respondent entered an Alford plea to the underlying sex charge was sufficient to establish a conviction for ch. 980.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed respondent's civil commitment as a sexually violent person because the psychiatrists' testimony, if believed, established that respondent was a mentally disturbed sexual sadist predisposed to committing further sexual assaults, and the credibility of the doctors was for the trial court. The court confirmed the constitutionality of the commitment laws in the face of respondent's ex post facto and double jeopardy challenges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, following a court trial, was committed to a secure mental health facility as a sexually violent person under Wis. Stat. ch. 980. He appealed his commitment along with an order denying his motion for postcommitment relief. The reviewing court affirmed and held that the lower court properly admitted expert testimony, even though the expert was not a licensed psychologist. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.35(1) did not bar the use of delinquency adjudications as evidence in the ch. 980 proceeding. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to allow the assumption that a sexually violent person with &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot; would engage in sexual violence in the future. This fact adequately satisfied the mental disorder criterion of the definition of &quot;sexually violent person&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.01(7). Moreover, the court held that &sect; 980.01(7) was constitutional because &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot; was not a vague or ambiguous term. Finally, the court held that plaintiff state's evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was &quot;substantially probable&quot; that defendant would engage in acts of sexual violence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's commitment to a mental health facility because of his history of sexual violence, his diagnosis of &quot;antisocial personality disorder,&quot; and the likelihood that he would commit further acts of sexual violence in the future.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought post-commitment relief, which was denied, and he then sought review. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to commit appellant as a sexually violent person; that Wis.

Defendant contended, among other claims, that the complaint was vague and duplicitous and that the trial court erred by admitting other acts evidence and imposing an unduly severe sentence. The appellate court held that the two-month time period in the complaint was sufficiently specific. Defendant was not denied his right to a unanimous verdict because the evidence described a pattern of conduct, and the jurors did not have to decide which act constituted the crime charged. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that other crimes evidence regarding additional assaults on the victim was relevant to show motive, intent, and plan under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.04(2), and that the probative value was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claims for a violation of plaintiffs' procedural and substantive due process rights and a violation of the equal protection clause was affirmed in part. In affirming the decision, the appeals court found that there was no procedural due process violation because plaintiffs had state remedies available to them. According to the appeals court, when a deprivation of property or liberty resulted from the random and unauthorized act of an official, procedural due process was satisfied if the state made available adequate post-deprivation remedies. The appeals court also held that substantive due process could not be read to include equal protection claims. In partially reversing the judgment, the appeals court found that plaintiffs did state a claim for relief under the equal protection clause. The appeals court held that if there was no suspect class or fundamental interest at stake, an ordinance violated the equal protection clause if the classifications were not rationally related to the asserted purpose of the ordinance. The appeals court found that plaintiffs' factual allegations were sufficient to state a claim for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate brought an action for declaratory relief and monetary damages against defendant prison officials under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging violations of his procedural due process rights at a prison disciplinary hearing. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiff's claim, and plaintiff appealed. On appeal, defendants contended that plaintiff's claim was not cognizable under &sect; 1983 because a judgment in his favor would require recalculation of his good time credits. The court agreed and affirmed the trial court's order on this basis. The court explained that when a state prisoner sought damages in a &sect; 1983 suit, the court was required to consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence. If it would, the complaint was to be dismissed unless the plaintiff could demonstrate that the conviction or sentence had already been invalidated. Plaintiff's claim for damages based on allegations of deceit and bias on the part of defendants necessarily implied the invalidity of the punishment imposed. Thus, the claim was not cognizable under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorcyclist was severely injured in an accident, declared incompetent, and placed in a conservatorship. Plaintiff conservator brought suit against defendant manufacturer, a Japanese corporation, claiming that the accident happened because of a defective tire. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. Plaintiff failed to achieve proper service on defendant, and thus the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant. Plaintiff had not served defendant within the sixty-day period required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.02. Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, Hague Convention art. 15 did not provide a six-month time limit, or any time limit, for service of process. Because the Hague Convention did not expressly state a time period for service of process to be completed, it did not conflict with Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.02. Thus, the trial court properly applied Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.02. Further, plaintiff's service of process on the secretary of state pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.847(4) was improper because defendant lacked sufficient contacts with the state and thus was not a foreign corporation transacting business in the state.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 971.14(4)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally required proof of incompetence by clear and convincing evidence when an accused claimed to be competent, evidence did not support conviction, venue was improper, certain jury instructions denied him a fair trial, he was denied effective assistance of counsel, he was denied counsel of his choice, and he paid the amount owed. The court concluded that no appealable error was committed, and it affirmed the convictions. The facial challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 971.14(4)(b) failed to show there were no possible statutory interpretations that would be constitutional. The evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant made false statements on his tax returns and concealed property to evade levy for taxes due.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with receiving stolen property under Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.34(1)(a), and habitual criminality under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62. The evidence showed that a security officer stopped defendant, who was walking through an apartment parking lot with a bundle on his shoulder, and asked him where he was going and what the bundle contained. Defendant said that he had been in an apartment, but he could not give the names of any residents, and said that he was carrying laundry. The officer, feeling objects in the bundle, searched and found home entertainment equipment. Defendant then attempted to escape. The trial court convicted defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction as defendant's evasiveness and escape attempt supported a conclusion that defendant knew the property was stolen. Defendant failed to prove that &sect; 943.34(1)(a) established a presumption that one carrying concealing property knew that the property was stolen; the statute was thus constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant provided no support for his claim that the right to a 12-person jury was a fundamental right that needed to be personally waived by defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Dane County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of using a dangerous weapon and extortion, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 939.63 and 943.30(1), for brandishing a rifle before two electric company workers, who were disconnecting his service for non-payment, and telling them they should reconnect the service, following a verdict in his favor in involuntary mental commitment proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When two electric company workers came out to his house to disconnect his service for non-payment, defendant carried his rifle over to them and said, &quot;If I were you, I would hook that back up.&quot; The workers then left immediately. Soon thereafter, proceedings were commenced to involuntarily commit defendant for mental illness. When a verdict was entered for defendant, criminal proceedings were commenced. Defendant was charged with using a dangerous weapon and extortion, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 939.63 and 943.30(1), but his first trial ended in a hung jury. When he was convicted on re-trial, he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled, inter alia, that the prosecution was not barred by double jeopardy because the commitment proceedings were civil in nature. Claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness were waived because defendant did not raise these issues prior to trial. Moreover, his actions and statements were sufficient to sustain the charges and convictions, even though his threat was implied, and it was no defense, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.14, that the workers may have been trespassing. Issues raised by defendant for the first time in a pro se reply brief were not considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed because double jeopardy did not preclude prosecution following civil commitment proceedings; claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness were waived since they were not raised before trial; defendant's actions were sufficient to support conviction, even though his threat was subtle; the workers' trespass on his property was not a defense; and issues raised for first time in his pro se reply brief would not be considered.</SPAN></P>

He claimed: (1) the state improperly used expert testimony as a conduit to adduce inadmissible hearsay; (2) the evidence was insufficient to support a &sect; 980 commitment; (3) the trial court denied him the right to the least restrictive setting for serving the commitment; and (4) &sect; 980 was unconstitutionally applied to him. The appellate court affirmed and held that expert testimony was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Testimony was admissible for a limited purpose and not for its substantive value. There was sufficient evidence to support the commitment, and determining respondent's proper placement under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.06 involved a discretionary act. The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Because he was a danger to his community, his equal protection argument failed. Due process only required his commitment to bear a reasonable relationship to the purpose for which he was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured was involved in an automobile accident and he entered into a settlement with the other driver. Plaintiff demanded underinsured motorist benefits from defendant insurer. Defendant denied plaintiff's demand and claimed that plaintiff did not meet the definition of underinsured motorist under the current policy, although plaintiff did meet the definition of underinsured motorist under a prior policy. The court held that Wis.

Because defendant's right to cancel notice did not provide this information, it was insufficient and defendant was required to continue the policy for an additional period of time equivalent to the expiring policy. Grant of summary judgment that declared plaintiff an underinsured motorist was affirmed.

The court reversed the judgment that awarded damages to plaintiffs, patient's estate, husband, and child, and remanded the case for a new trial on the issue of liability and damages because the trial court's decision contained several factual inaccuracies and the trial court failed to address the material issue of contributory negligence even though there were facts suggesting that the patient had not taken responsibility for her own well-being. The court held that plaintiffs' action was timely filed under Wis.

When the misdiagnosis and the development of metastatic cancer was first discovered it was reasonably clear that the misdiagnosis would result in future expenses. At that time plaintiff patient suffered injury for which he had a claim. Accordingly, the action was time barred under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55(1)(b) because it was not brought within one year of the date when injury was discovered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school districts, parents, students, and taxpayers, and intervening plaintiffs, education counsel, teachers, and administrators, challenged the constitutionality of Wisconsin's public school funding system, arguing that the state's equalization formula failed to adequately address the substantial disparity in resource levels for various districts, and that it failed to take into account the differing needs of certain children, who were disproportionately located in lower property value districts. Defendants, state treasurer, state superintendent, and department of revenue, and plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. The circuit court granted defendants' motion on the basis that plaintiffs failed to provide the statistical evidence to prove that the current system created greater disparities among lower and higher property value districts than existed when an earlier case was decided by the supreme court. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, finding that plaintiff failed to objectively establish that the disparities were greater than the disparities in the earlier decided case and that certain children were being denied a basic education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his judgment of conviction for second degree sexual assault of a child. Defendant argued that his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because his trial counsel did not properly impeach the state's primary witness. In analyzing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the first element of the Strickland test required defendant to show that counsel's performance was deficient, that counsel made such serious errors he or she was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed defendant by the Sixth Amendment. The child testified that defendant assaulted her in the morning on Easter Sunday. At trial, however, the child did not explicitly specify the day of the assault as Easter Sunday and defendant's trial counsel did not ask the exact date or attempt to impeach her less precise trial testimony with that of the preliminary hearing. Defendant's conviction was affirmed because assistance of counsel did not fall below the conduct of a reasonably competent attorney where such an attempt to impeach the child may have resulted in the district attorney rehabilitating her by highlighting the large number of assaults that occurred over the years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Patient challenged his involuntary commitment, arguing that: (1) the trial court erroneously instructed the jury and made erroneous evidentiary rulings; (2) newly discovered evidence required a new trial; (3) the prosecutor made improper argument; (4) he should not have been committed but granted supervised release; (5) he was denied due process by operation of Wis.

The appeals court agreed with the first contention and remanded on that issue. Subsequent to trial, the court published the Kienitz case and concluded that &quot;substantially probable,&quot; as used in Wis. Jury Instructions Crim. 2502, meant considerably more likely to occur than not to occur. Because the trial court's instruction was incomplete in light of Kienitz, it was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff provider instituted an action for breach of contract against defendant customer.

The court held that when the verdict was reinstated, interest under Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.04(4), accrued from the date of the original verdict regardless of whether the trial court had set aside the verdict by granting a motion for a new trial or one for JNOV. Therefore, the court held that, under the circumstances, it was not inappropriate for the customer to bear the cost of the delay in the provider's receipt of the damages to which it was entitled by virtue of the jury's verdict. The court also held that although it may well have been within the trial court's discretion to award costs on the customer's counterclaim, the trial court did not do so. The court concluded that the trial court's award of costs under the mistaken belief that it was bound by the earlier assessment of costs for the retrial of punitive damages, was erroneous. Therefore, the court reversed the offset allowed in the judgment for costs and interest in favor of the customer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farm wished to maintain a bird hunting area. The farm argued, inter alia, that the trial court had erred by granting summary judgment because: (1) game farm regulation was within the exclusive province of the department of natural resources (DNR) and, therefore, not subject to the town and county's regulation; and (2) immunity did not apply because the town and county were engaged in ministerial acts, not discretionary acts. The court of appeals held that the trial court had not erred because: (1) for the farm to operate a game bird farm in the county, it needed to obtain both the necessary permit from the DNR and the necessary zoning approval from the county board, and it failed to obtain the latter; and (2) the DNR's authority to issue a permit for the operation of a game farm was separate from the town and county's authority to create and enforce zoning ordinances, therefore, the town and county did not exceed their authority, nor were they acting ministerially when they elected to enforce the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court accepted the State's experts' definition of &quot;substantially probable&quot; as &quot;more likely than not,&quot; and concluded that defendant suffered from the mental disorder of pedophilia and was dangerous to others because he presented a substantial probability of committing future acts of sexual violence. After the trial court's decision in this case, the court rejected an argument that &quot;substantially probable&quot; meant &quot;extreme likelihood&quot; and concluded that &quot;substantially probable&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.01(7), meant &quot;considerably more likely to occur than not to occur.&quot; Accordingly, the court reversed and remanded the action to the trial court for its determination under the new standard.The court also held that the trial court erroneously concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.03(6), allowed the presentence investigation reports (PSI) to be admitted in toto because the presentence investigation reports contained statements by declarants who were not part of the, the organization that prepared the record. Therefore, the court held that the trial court should consider whether to waive the confidentiality of the PSI reports.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court reversed and remanded this case to the trial court for its determination whether it was substantially probable that defendant would engage in sexual violence and to consider whether to waive the confidentiality of the PSI reports.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior action, the court concluded that the city's channelization of a creek violated &sect; 30.12 and that &sect; 30.055, which purported to exempt the creek from the requirements of &sect; 30.12 was unconstitutional. However, after that decision the legislature re-enacted the exemption through &sect; 30.056. The state, through its attorney general, brought an action against the city and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 30.056. The trial court found in favor of the state and the city appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court found that the attorney general qualified as &quot;any person&quot; under &sect; 30.294. However, the attorney general could not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 30.056 because it was his job to defend the statute.&nbsp;Wis. Const. art.

The attorney general was not authorized to make the constitutional challenge because it was not one of his official duties.

Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. Defendant contended that he was unable to submit to the breath test because he was missing several lower teeth. A physical inability to take a breath test was the only proper basis on which a driver could refuse to take the test. The trial court's determination that defendant did not meet his burden of establishing that he was physically unable, due to a disease or disability, of providing a breath sample could not be disturbed on appeal unless that finding was clearly erroneous. The trial court's finding here was not clearly erroneous because defendant did prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the absence of lower teeth prevented him from giving a breath sample.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building operator was the operator of two residential buildings. The city filed two complaints against him for building code violations at those two buildings. The complaints summoned him to appear before the municipal court and answer the complaints. He failed to appear. The municipal court entered default judgments for the city. The building owner moved to vacate the default judgments. He appeared before the municipal court and asserted both that he was not liable for the violations because he was not the owner of the buildings and that he was never served with the complaints. The municipal court concluded no common law nor statutory authority existed for holding a building operator liable for building code violations and that city ordinances purporting to be the basis for liability were invalid because they conflicted with a state statute. After the trial court affirmed, the appellate court found the state statute did not apply to the city, and thus, the city ordinances could be used to impose liability on the building operator. The case was sent back to the municipal court to determine whether the building owner was properly served.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), after a jury trial, committed defendant to a secure mental health facility as a sexually violent person. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved the trial court in limine to preclude reference to his assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege to remain silent in regard to a psychologist who did an examination that relied on reports of others, without a personal interview. Defendant also sought to be allowed to challenge the examination precisely because the doctor failed to interview him. The appellate court held because defendant challenged the doctor and his examination for the failure to interview, the trial court correctly allowed the State to elicit the doctor's testimony about the refusal so as to rebut the implication that the doctor's examination was thus improper. Diagnosis of &quot;antisocial personality disorder,&quot; uncoupled with any other diagnosis but coupled with sufficient evidence establishing that defendant was a &quot;sexually violent person,&quot; could constitute a mental disorder that made it substantially probable that the person would engage in acts of sexual violence, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.01(7). In allowing &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot; to meet the &quot;mental disorder&quot; criterion, &sect; 980.01(7) was sufficiently precise to satisfy due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney entered into a contract to have trees removed from his property, and misled the loggers as to a property line, so that they caused substantial damage to the neighbor's property. The court noted that after an order denying the attorney's motion to dismiss the neighbor's complaint, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.06(1) he then had ten days after that date in which to file an answer, which he failed to do. His &quot;answer,&quot; and the documents with which he inundated the trial court, not only fail the test of timeliness, but were equally lacking in both form and substance and failed to comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.02(2). The neighbor alleged that the attorney's acts were undertaken in wanton and reckless disregard of her rights and interests, and the court ruled the allegations were sufficient, under Wisconsin's notice-pleading rules, to state a punitive damage claim. The record indicated that the neighbor not only suffered the loss of the trees, but the improper cutting of the logging road through her property caused ecological damage, erosion problems, and changes to the watershed, so there was no error in the trial court's award of compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion. The court reversed and remanded. The notice of claim requirement in &sect; 893.82(3) did not apply because the agency was not a state officer, employee, or agent within the meaning of &sect; 893.82(3). A state &quot;agent&quot; in &sect; 893.82(3) meant an individual and did not mean a state &quot;agency.&quot; Even if the complaints had been amended to name an officer, employee or agent of the agency as a defendant, &sect; 893.82(3) still would have been inapplicable because the agency was not a state agency, but was rather a governmental subdivision or agency thereof within the meaning of Wis.

Stat. &sect; 347.39, violated due process and Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.303 required probable cause to arrest before an officer requested a breath sample for a preliminary breath test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while under the influence of an intoxicant after an officer stopped him because of a loud sound of exhaust emitting from defendant's vehicle. Based on a subsequent blood test, defendant was also charged with driving with a prohibited alcohol concentration. In reversing the trial court's judgment of conviction, the court concluded that the muffler statute was not unconstitutionally vague and therefore the officer's detention of defendant for a violation of that statute was proper. Also, the court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.303 required probable cause to arrest before administration of the preliminary breath test. The officer, however, did not have probable cause to arrest defendant before asking him to provide a breath sample because instances of unsteadiness during field sobriety tests, when considered in the context of all the evidence, were minimal and did not demonstrate that there was more than a possibility that defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant to the degree that made him incapable of driving safely. Thus, the results of the test were not admissible at the hearing on defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress the results of a preliminary breath test and reversed defendant's judgment of conviction for driving while under the influence of an intoxicant and with a prohibited alcohol concentration.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments because ch. 980 was constitutional. In addition, the appellate court found that trial counsel was not ineffective as: (1) the evidence was sufficient, and a reasonable jury could have found there was a substantial probability that the sex offender would reoffend; (2) trial counsel adequately addressed the &quot;mental disorder&quot; element; and (3) &quot;substantially probable&quot; was not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insureds appealed a grant of summary judgment for defendant insurer from the Circuit Court for Washington County (Wisconsin), dismissing a claim for underinsured motorist benefits under automobile liability policies. The issue was whether the insurer was obligated by Wis. Stat. &sect; 631.36(5), its policies, or both to notify the insureds of a limitation in coverage occasioned by the enactment of Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(j).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 631.36(5), which required automobile liability insurers to provide notice when a policy was renewed on less favorable terms, did not apply where a reduction of coverage was triggered by the legislature's action of the legislature. The trial court also ruled that the language of the policies did not obligate the insurer to provide notice. As a result, the &quot;drive other car&quot; exclusions in the policies were enforceable even though the insurer had not given the notice that the legislature had validated such exclusions following a judicial decision which had invalidated them. In affirming the grant of summary judgment to the insurer, the court held that the insurer was not required by statute, the terms of its policy, or a combination of both to notify the insureds of changes in coverage due to legislative action. The enactment of Wis. Stat. &sect; 632.32(5)(j) did not unconstitutionally deprive the insureds of their right to contract. Finally, the trial court's ruling did not violate the public policy reflected by Wis. Stat. &sect; 631.36(5).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of OWI in February 1988, and received a first offense civil forfeiture. In June 1996, defendant was convicted of OWI a second time. Defendant did not retain counsel for either of those civil forfeiture convictions. In May 1997, defendant was cited for OWI a third time. It was defendant's third OWI offense within the 10-year statutory period and the trial court counted his two prior OWI forfeiture convictions to convict and sentence defendant as a third-time offender. Defendant contended that the trial court erred by relying upon two prior uncounseled civil forfeiture OWI convictions to subject him to prosecution and punishment as a third-time OWI offender as it violated his due process and equal protection rights under the Wisconsin and United States Constitutions. The appellate court concluded that uncounseled civil forfeiture OWI convictions were valid for all purposes including providing a basis for incarcerating defendant. Therefore, defendant's due process challenges failed. In addition, the appellate court held that defendant's equal protection argument failed.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty of, inter alia, first degree murder, but determined that he was not responsible for the homicides because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Defendant was committed to a state hospital. Over the years, defendant successfully completed WMHI treatment programs. Defendant filed a petition for re-examination and conditional release. A jury found that defendant was still dangerous and the trial court recommitted him. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in framing a dangerousness instruction because Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.17 (1987-88) specified no particular dangerousness level. Further, the instructions, taken in context, made clear that defendant could be released with the imposition of certain court-imposed conditions. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of dangerousness. Finally, an individual showing that confinement was necessary to address a particular medical treatment was not required. Thus, defendant was not denied substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 948.02(1) was unconstitutional; and (7) he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel. The trial court properly admitted the social worker's statement. The trial court found the child to be a verbal and bright six-year-old who was able to differentiate between truth and falsity. The trial court was entitled to conclude that inconsistencies among the child's various statements were not so great as to outweigh other factors bearing on reliability. The record reflected a reasonable exercise of discretion by the trial court in denying defendant's request to permit the jury to take notes. Because defendant must have realized that touching a child's vaginal area constituted sexual assault, &sect; 948.02(1) was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant was not denied the right to effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 157.067(2), 445.12(6), which prohibited certain connections between cemeteries and funeral homes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The funeral home corporation and the cemetery corporation were established as separate state corporations under a larger umbrella funeral home corporation in order for the larger funeral home corporation to operate funeral homes and cemeteries within the State of Wisconsin, because Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 157.067(2), 445.12(6), prohibited one corporation from owning and operating both cemeteries and funeral homes. The funeral home corporation and cemetery corporation filed a complaint against the Department, and summary judgment was granted to the department. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the status of the funeral home corporation and the cemetery corporation as subsidiaries of a larger corporation created impermissible financial connections that violated Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 157.067(2), 445.12(6) on its face. The court further held that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 157.067(2), 445.12(6) were not void for vagueness because the statute gave fair notice that funeral establishments and cemeteries were not to have financial connections to each other. The court finally dismissed the remaining constitutional arguments for failure to properly brief the issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with felony false swearing for giving inconsistent testimony in depositions in civil lawsuits under Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 946.32(1). He sought a dismissal, contending the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court denied his motion, finding that the statute of limitations was tolled, under Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 939.74(3), while defendant was incarcerated out of state, which ruling was affirmed on appeal. Defendant then pled guilty to misdemeanor false swearing as a habitual offender under Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 946.32(2), 939.62(1)(b), and the complaint was amended. Defendant claimed that the amended complaint was time barred, but the court affirmed the conviction because it was clear from the record that defendant had waived the objection through an informed guilty plea. However, the court vacated the fine because the fine in the oral pronouncement, which was controlling, was less than that in the judgment of conviction. The state argued that the difference was the costs imposed, but could not verify that from the record. The court directed the state on remand to provide the trial court with documentation of the costs.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying defendant's motion to exclude the testimony of certain witnesses based on the State's failure to comply with a discovery order because the trial court considered the relevant facts, applied the proper standard of law, and used a rational process to reach a reasonable conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmer received a building permit for a pole barn to store hay to feed his bison. Instead of using the barn for storage, however, he opened a retail store for the sale of bison meat. On appeal, the court rejected his challenges to the ordinance. The court held that the definition of &quot;farming&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.04(3), which permitted direct distribution to consumers, was not synonymous with &quot;agribusiness&quot; as used in the ordinance. The ordinance clearly did not authorize agribusiness as a separate land use. Further, the farmer showed no evidence of intentional, systematic, or arbitrary discrimination by the town's enforcement of the ordinance. Finally, the town's amendment of the ordinance allowing the sale of certain items but not the sale of meat did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. There was a distinction with a difference surrounding the sale of meat and other farm-produced items. Given the purpose of the ordinance to provide for, maintain, preserve, and enhance agricultural lands historically utilized for crop production, regulating the nature of any commercial use of the property was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment in favor of respondent ex-wife on her petition for divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife brought suit against the ex-husband seeking divorce. The circuit entered judgment in favor of the ex-wife and issued various orders in connection with the divorce. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the circuit court did not err in basing the ex-husband's child support obligations on his earning capacity rather than his actual earnings. Despite the ex-husband' argument to the contrary, the court held that the circuit court was not required to accept the expert testimony on the ex-husband's earnings even though it was uncontradicted. The court further held that the circuit court did not err in denying the ex-husband's request to leave maintenance open for him indefinitely because he did not offer a reason or basis for his request. The court noted that awarding maintenance was discretionary with the circuit court. The court also determined that the circuit court decision permitting the ex-husband to claim his son as an exemption on his income tax only if he was current in his child support did not constitute a &quot;per se abuse&quot; of discretion. The court reasoned that Wis. Admin Code &sect; HSS 80.03(6) sanctioned a conditional order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since 1963, defendant was convicted of sex crimes against children three times and had probations revoked for similar offenses. After the supreme court upheld Wis. Stat. ch. 980's constitutionality, the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), on remand and trial to the court, ordered defendant to be committed to a secure mental health facility as a sexually violent person, and denied postconviction relief. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that defendant had been convicted of a sexually violent offense and was dangerous because he suffered from a mental disorder, pedophilia, which made it substantially probable that he would commit sexual violence. The trial court thoroughly summarized each of the three presented experts' opinions and found defendant's expert to be more persuasive than the State's, whose methods were not validated by any scientific testing and because they used clinical judgment, a poor predictor of recidivism. The decision leaned heavily on those opinions and the history of deliberate violations. The appellate court found that &quot;substantially probable&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.01(7) meant: considerably more likely to occur than not. The dictionary definition sufficed. The phrase was not unconstitutionally vague. &quot;Substantial evidence&quot; review for criminal cases applied. The trial court did not have to rely on experts to find sexual violence to be probable and was free to weigh their testimony. The expert testimony on recidivism did not have to be based on actuarial methodology. Legal and medical definitions had to be kept separate in the context of ch. 980.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal of the order of the Circuit Court for Vernon County (Wisconsin) requiring him to give the prosecutor a summary of his expert witness's findings and the subject matter of his testimony under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.23(2m)(am). Defendant, charged with causing death by the intoxicated use of a vehicle, argued that the statute was unconstitutional and that disclosure would violate his right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to produce a summary of his expert witness's findings and testimony. On interlocutory appeal, the court affirmed the order, finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.23(2m) was procedural rather than substantive and, thus, was not subject to challenge as being void for vagueness. The court ruled that the statute was not overbroad and that disclosure of the expert's opinion would not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination because it did not compel testimony, but merely accelerated the timing of the disclosure. The court found that the self-incrimination privilege was personal, adhering to the person not to information that may incriminate him, and that information compiled by the expert was not personal to defendant. The court ruled that the order did not infringe on defendant's right to counsel or the attorney-client privilege because he could seek a protective order or in camera review to resolve these claims. The court found that defendant had to disclose a summary of the expert's findings or testimony and any test results to be offered at trial, and that his initial response that the expert would present the results of his examination was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's interlocutory order requiring defendant to provide the prosecutor with a summary of his expert witness's findings and the subject matter of the witness's testimony and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred when it refused to strike for cause jurors who earlier rejected the identical theory of defense to be employed by defendant. The court ruled that a determination by a trial court that a prospective juror could be impartial was overturned only where the prospective juror's bias was manifest. Further, the court held that a prospective juror's bias was manifest whenever a review of the record did not support a finding that the prospective juror was a reasonable person who was sincerely willing to put aside an opinion or prior knowledge or did not support a finding that a reasonable person in the juror's position could set aside the opinion or prior knowledge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for violating a city ordinance against knowingly resisting or obstructing an officer while he was doing any act in an official capacity and with lawful authority. When an officer found marijuana in his pocket, he was charged with drug possession, but not the ordinance violation. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, ruling that the officer had probable cause to arrest. Defendant pled guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the officers acted lawfully in approaching a group of men and asking questions while investigating drug activity in the area. The court ruled that the officers had the right to chase and apprehend defendant when he ran from the group because his flight destabilized the situation and interfered with the officers' ability to talk to the others, in violation of the ordinance. The court found that the arrest was lawful because the officers had reasonable grounds, or probable cause, to believe that defendant violated the ordinance. The court concluded that, because defendant's arrest for violating the ordinance was lawful, the search incident to the arrest was lawful and the motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

It was irrelevant, the court said, whether these experts believed that it was more likely than not or much more likely than not that defendant would commit another offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from a non-final order of the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied her motion to dismiss the charge of first-degree intentional homicide, party to a crime, and ordered that she should not be &quot;reverse waived&quot; to the juvenile court, but instead, should remain subject to the jurisdiction of the adult court pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 938.183 and 970.032.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court denying defendant's motion to dismiss and ordering that defendant should not be &quot;reversed waived&quot; to juvenile court, defendant appealed. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred because the &quot;reverse waiver&quot; statutory scheme violated her constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. The court concluded that a decision regarding defendant equal protection claim, as well as claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, cruel and unusual punishment, and the Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 claim would have been based on hypothetical or future facts. Therefore, these claims were not ripe for review and the court refused to address them. The court noted that if defendant was convicted on one of the lesser-included offenses of first-degree intentional homicide, a juvenile disposition could occur. However, defendant's trial had not occurred at the time of the appeal and the claim was not ripe for review. The court also held that neither Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 938.183 and 970.032 were vague or ambiguous. The statutes provided the trial court standards with which to decided whether to retain jurisdiction or send defendant's case to juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion for post-conviction relief under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06, for his conviction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 139.95 for possession of drugs without a tax stamp. Defendant alleged violations of his constitutional rights and ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 139.95, which prohibited the possession of drugs without a tax stamp, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, but the trial court declined to apply that determination retroactively to defendant's case because he pleaded no contest the charges. The main issue on appeal was whether to retroactively apply that holding to the present case; that is, whether retroactive application was warranted when the conduct in question could not constitutionally be punished in the first place. The court held that retroactive application of a controlling judicial precedent that declared a criminal statute to be unconstitutional was required because failure to do so led to the untenable result that a person was convicted for conduct that was held constitutionally immune from punishment. Therefore, where the trial court had no subject matter jurisdiction over a non-existent crime, even if the conviction was based on a plea agreement, or by a plea of no contest as in defendant's case, the conviction had to be vacated. An offense created by an unconstitutional statute was no longer a crime, and a conviction under such statute could not be a legal cause for imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for possession of drugs without a tax stamp, as well as the order that denied postconviction relief, and remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate defendant's drug tax stamp law conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's boathouse was destroyed by fire. The county denied their application to rebuild, and the board of adjustment affirmed. The owners later sought a permit under a newly enacted statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.121(2), which permitted reconstruction after fire, but it was denied. The owners then rebuilt the boathouse and sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance prohibiting wet boathouses was unconstitutional. The county filed a separate action seeking forfeiture. The trial court ordered forfeiture. On appeal, the court affirmed the forfeiture but remanded solely for a determination whether the county ordinance constituted an unlawful taking. The trial court resolved the constitutional issue in favor of the county. On a second appeal, the court reversed the trial court's determination with respect to constitutionality and held that, in view of the new legislation which permitted rebuilding, the constitutionality of the ordinance need not be addressed. The court held that the parties had not yet litigated the scope of the new statute and its applicability to the boathouse constructed by the owners. Thus, the court ruled that the issue was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the mother claimed that the term &quot;substantial progress&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2)(c), was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court affirmed the orders holding that the first claim was not supported by the appellate record because there was no transcript of the hearing in the appellate record. The court held that parents did not have a constitutionally protected right to counsel in all child protective hearings and absent a transcript, the decision would not be overturned. The court held that the mother had additionally not met her burden on the second claim of establishing the unconstitutionality of the statute in question because the term &quot;substantial progress,&quot; while it left some discretion to the courts, there was no right to make minimal progress so her argument failed.</SPAN></P>

Applying due-weight deference to the Commission's decision, the court found that the Commission could have reasonably concluded, on the facts, that the flexible time-share sales were not fixed as to either unit or starting time within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52(2)(a)1. The court further held that it was reasonable for the Commission to have concluded that the flexible time-share sales were subject to taxation under &sect; 77.52(2)(a)1. The court determined that the taxpayer had not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislature's decision to tax the sale of flexible time-shares, while not taxing the sale of guaranteed time-shares, resulted in the type of invidious discrimination the equal protection clause was designed to protect against.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order upholding the Commission's decision to confirm the Department's assessment against the taxpayer for delinquent taxes on the sale of flexible time-shares.</SPAN></P>

The bar owner on appeal argued that &sect; 823.09 and &sect; 823.10&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated his federal due process and freedom of association rights. The court reasoned that &sect;&sect; 823.09 and 823.10, and Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 823.11 provided the bar owner the opportunity to rebut the prima facie evidence that he had knowledge of the prostitution activity and to collaterally attack the convictions supporting the nuisance case. Therefore, the court concluded that the statutes did not deprive the bar owner of due process. Further, the court held that the bar owner was free to associate with whomever he desired. However, under &sect;&sect; 823.09, 823.10 and 823.11, he could not permit his property to be used for acts of prostitution. The court concluded that the statutes in question did not violate constitutional rights to freedom of association, the protection against government establishment of a religion, and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) entered in favor of petitioner mother, which denied him any periods of physical placement with his three children, permanently prohibited him from petitioning for any change in physical placement rights, changed the children's surnames, and ordered the domestic abuse injunction converted to a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had been in prison for most of the children's lives and the trial court found he was unfit to have or to ever seek physical placement of them. The father argued that the trial court lacked the statutory authority to make a prospective order and to change the children's surnames. The court reversed those orders, finding that the trial court exceeded its authority. The guardian ad litem submitted an affidavit which served as the underpinnings for obtaining a child abuse temporary restraining order. The record was insufficient to review the court's discretion in that order. The mother also brought a temporary restraining order, which was not appealed. The finding that the father was an unfit parent, based on the testimony of one of the expert witnesses, was sufficient to invoke Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(4)(b). However, Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.325(4)(b), did not permit the trial court to make a prospective order prohibiting the father from requesting a change in physical placement in the future. None of the procedural steps in Wis. Stat. &sect; 786.36 were followed, therefore the trial court's order changing the names of the children was in contradiction to the statute and was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders changing the children's surnames and prohibiting the father from seeking placement of the children in the future and remanded the issue of payment of fees to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 941.23, obstructing an officer in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.41(1) and disorderly conduct in violation of &sect; 947.01.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer testified that he discovered an unoccupied vehicle blocking the lane of traffic. As he approached the vehicle, defendant appeared and told the officer that the vehicle was his. The officer instructed defendant to wait in the vehicle and the officer returned to his squad car to run the license plate information through dispatch. Defendant then approached the squad car and did not stop when told to do so. The officer held defendant against the vehicle and patted him down. After his arrest, defendant filed a motion to suppress the three-inch steak knife that the officer found in his pocket. The trial court concluded that the search was not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and alternately, that there were articulable facts that provided a reasonable ground for the officer to believe that defendant was violating a traffic law. On appeal, the court agreed with defendant that a seizure took place when the officer directed him to sit in his vehicle. The court concluded, however, that both the seizure and the pat down were supported by the necessary reasonable suspicion and were therefore, constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that ordering a party to seek work as part of a child support order was within the discretion of the trial court. Further, the court held that it had previously determined that an SSI recipient could have been ordered to seek work. The court further held that an order to pay child support where the obligor's only source of income was her SSI benefits would have violated the protection from legal process provided to Social Security benefits under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court (Wisconsin) in a certiorari action for judicial review of the denial of its license to operate an &quot;adult-oriented establishment&quot; by respondent City of Waukesha. The licensee asserted that Waukesha, Wis. Code &sect; 8.195 (1995) failed to preserve the status quo during the license renewal process and was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee sought to renew its license to operate an &quot;adult-oriented establishment,&quot; pursuant to Waukesha, Wis., Code &sect; 8.195 (1995). The City, by its common council passed a resolution that found the licensee had committed several violations of the ordinance and, as a result, denied the renewal of its license. The licensee sought administrative review, which affirmed the City's decision. In a certiorari action, the trial court upheld the denial, and the licensee appealed, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 8.195 because it failed to preserve the status quo during the license renewal process. The court concluded that there was no Wisconsin law and no Supreme Court statement on whether the absence of an explicit status quo provision rendered an ordinance facially unconstitutional. Because it concluded that the issue would greatly impact local municipalities' regulation of adult-oriented establishments, the court requested the Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide the issue. It further requested a determination of two related issues: the constitutionality of no express time limits for judicial review and the propriety of denying renewal without first invoking a lesser sanction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court requested the state's highest court to accept jurisdiction and to decide the issues related to the constitutionality of the local licensing ordinance in an action by the licensee against the City, seeking to invalidate the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an adult bookstore operator, was charged with violating Kenosha County, Wis., Ordinance No. 9.10.2 for selling allegedly obscene videotapes. At trial, defendant stipulated to that the videotape was sold for commercial purposes and was sexually explicit, leaving only the issue of whether the tape was obscene. A jury in the Circuit Court of Kenosha County (Wisconsin) returned a non-unanimous guilty verdict, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county ordinance which defendant was charged with violating was identical to Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.21 in all respects except that the penalty provisions varied and prosecution under the statute requires the approval of the attorney general, while prosecuting under the ordinance did not. At trial, the parties stipulated the fact that the videotape was sold for commercial purposes and that defendant knew the tape was sexually explicit, leaving as the only contested issue whether the tape was &quot;obscene material.&quot; No Wisconsin court had determined whether the statute regulating obscenity was constitutionally permissible, and if it was, whether the Miller standards of obscenity were applicable. The statute had state-wide criminal and forfeiture consequences, and a court of appeals affirmance or reversal of defendant's case would have simply delayed the inevitability of supreme court review.

The court held that the church members did not present any relevant facts to the court as to why their case constituted one of limited circumstances under which a negligent supervision claim could be asserted successfully against a religious organization. The negligent supervision claim was also barred by U.S. Const. amend. I. Also, the pastor's initiations of sexual contact with female church member were outside the scope of his employment.

Defendant was convicted of first-degree reckless injury and resisting an officer. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court stated that a jury could conclude that a victim suffered &quot;great bodily harm&quot; as long as the victim suffered an injury that was &quot;serious,&quot; defining the term as it was ordinarily understood, regardless of whether the injury created a substantial risk of death, permanent disfigurement, or impairment. The court determined that the testimony established that defendant placed the officer in a choke hold, causing her to stop breathing, and this evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict that defendant caused great bodily harm to the officer under circumstances that showed utter disregard for human life under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.23(1). The court held that defendant's proposed jury instruction could have erroneously misled the jury to believe that if a particular injury fell within the definition of substantial bodily harm, it could not qualify as great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the anti-stalking statute was not constitutionally infirm. It was not vague and overbroad. The statute clearly defined the behavior forbidden, provided fair notice, and did not infringe upon constitutionally protected activities. The court ruled that defendant was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel. Evidence of other acts was admissible under Wis. R. Evid., Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.04(2). Thus defendant's trial counsel was not deficient in failing to prevent its admission. The court ruled that defendant's counsel's questioning of witnesses, which evoked other bad acts, was a tactic to demonstrate that the victim did not fear defendant. The court ruled that the strategy was not unreasonable, and defendant's counsel was not deficient. The court ruled that defendant's counsel was not deficient by reason of his failure to object to the admission of certain handwritten notes constituting a diary made by the victim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and stipulated to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .22 percent.

On appeal, the court held that there was no evidence to support defendant's allegation that the State modified the charge to coerce defendant into pleading guilty. The court found that the State increased the charge upon further consideration and after realizing that the evidence could support a conviction of intentional homicide. Thus, the State did not abuse its discretion in altering the charge. Regarding defendant's contention that the trial court erred in sentencing him, the court found that the trial court considered defendant's prior offenses, the gravity of the homicide offense, and the need to protect the public from defendant's violent character.

The court found defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel by his counsel's failure to obtain a copy of a preliminary hearing transcript to impeach a state's witness where counsel lacked a reasonable excuse for failing to obtain a copy. The court found, however, that the error did not require reversal where defendant was not prejudiced by the lack of the preliminary transcript because the inconsistent testimony was minor when compared to the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. The court concluded the trial court erroneously communicated with the jury without defendant being present, but that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because defendant's attorney was present during the conversation, the conversation did not occur in open court, and did not involve a legal problem.

The court determined that the exhaustion requirement of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1997e(a) did not apply to petitioner's federal complaint because it was filed three days before the enactment of &sect; 1997e(a).

When defendant was about to complete his sentence on that conviction, the State filed a petition to have defendant committed under the sexual predator law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.

Stat. &sect; 756.096(3)(am), which reduced the number of jurors in misdemeanor cases from 12 to six, was unconstitutional. The trial court (Wisconsin) denied the motion. Defendant was convicted on two of the misdemeanor counts. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a series of appellate decisions had interpreted Wis. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5, 7 as requiring a 12-person jury in misdemeanor cases. The State responded that no Wisconsin case had held that legislatively mandated six-person juries in misdemeanor cases violated a defendant's constitutional right. The statute controlling the size of misdemeanor juries was used daily in the court system. Its constitutionality was a matter of statewide importance with administrative and fiscal implications. Because a decision on the issue could have affected a large number of pending and completed cases, the appellate court found that it was in the public interest to have the issue decided quickly and with finality. The arguments in the case required analysis and interpretation of the state constitution and previous decisions of the supreme court. These tasks were best performed by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was certified to the supreme court to decide whether the statute reducing the number of jurors in misdemeanor cases from 12 to six violated the Wisconsin Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting an 85-year-old widow in her home. He contended that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of kidnapping because his confinement of the victim was solely incidental to the sexual assaults. Alternatively, he argued that Wisconsin's kidnapping statute was unconstitutionally vague and that the kidnapping charge was not appropriate. The appellate court noted that the State proved that defendant confined the victim without her consent and with the intent that she be held to service against her will, and held that the evidence was sufficient to establish the crime of kidnapping, regardless of the incidental role of that crime to the sexual assault. The appellate court further held that a party whose conduct was clearly proscribed by a statute in question did not have standing to challenge it on the grounds of being vague as it might be applied to others. The appellate court concluded that if any of the elements of proof of a crime required were different in the crimes charged, they could be considered separate crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DHSS established guidelines to establish which hospitals qualified for supplemental funding under the statute. The hospital did not qualify for the rural hospital adjustment, because its operating statistics exceeded the median amount for Wisconsin urban hospitals in each of three statistical categories. Because DHSS had at least one opportunity to analyze &sect; 49.45(5m) and interpret the phrase &quot;rural hospital&quot; as it was used in that section, the court gave due weight deference to DHSS' interpretation. The hospital argued that DHSS' interpretation created an anomaly between its inpatient and outpatient hospital state plans. Therefore, according to the hospital, it qualified for the rural hospital adjustment for the outpatient services that it provided to Medicare and Medicaid participants, but not for inpatient services. Because DHSS reasonably distinguished outpatient services from inpatient services, the court concluded that DHSS' interpretation of &quot;rural hospital&quot; was reasonable. Further, because DHSS' rural hospital adjustment eligibility requirements were not irrational or arbitrary, the court concluded that the hospital was not denied its right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Richland County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of one count of first-degree sexual assault of a child in violation of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court violated his constitutional right of confrontation by declaring a child victim of sexual assault &quot;unavailable&quot; to testify at trial, and admitting statements made by her to a social worker under the &quot;residual&quot; hearsay exception, Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.045(6). He also argues that &sect; 948.11, which criminalized the act of exposing a child to harmful materials, was unconstitutional because it did not require the State to prove defendant knew the recipient was a minor. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court concluded that the State satisfied the Confrontation Clause because it had produced the child, whose inability to recall the incident or to respond made her unavailable, and established that her out-of-court statement bore sufficient indicia of reliability. The statement had been given to an experienced social worker with no apparent motive to coerce the child or distort her statement. The court concluded that the lack of a scienter requirement in &sect; 948.11(2)(a), regarding the age of a child, did not render it unconstitutional. The statute reasonably imposed upon defendant the obligation to ascertain the child's age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of first-degree sexual assault of a child and three counts of exposing a child to harmful materials and its order denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being waived from juvenile court into the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), defendant pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide. He filed a postconviction motion to withdraw his plea on the grounds that his counsel was ineffective for not appealing the waiver into adult court. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that counsel was not ineffective because any appeal of the waiver would have been unsuccessful. Agreeing, the court first held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.366(1)(a)(1), allowing the juvenile court to extend its jurisdiction in certain cases, clearly and unambiguously did not allow the juvenile court to extend jurisdiction to age 25 in attempted first-degree intentional homicide cases. Next, the court held, applying a rational basis test, that the statute did not violate either substantive due process or equal protection. The court stated that the legislature's intent in enacting the statute was to protect the community from violent juvenile offenders who had been adjudged delinquent by the juvenile court and who could otherwise have been released from custody as early as age 19. Viewed in this light, the court stated, the legislative decision to allow the juvenile court to extend jurisdiction in cases of completed first-degree intentional homicide, but not in cases of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, was reasonable because the legislature was entitled to view juveniles who committed homicide as more dangerous than those who only made attempts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court for Dane County (Wisconsin) granted defendant's motion to dismiss sexual assault charges, holding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(c) was unconstitutionally vague when it proscribed sexual intercourse or sexual contact with a person who was temporarily or permanently incapable of appraising the person's conduct. Defendant had sexual contact on two occasions with one of the mildly retarded adults in his care. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purported victim was a 22-year old man, who had no prior sexual experience. The court explained that the vagueness standard required the provision of fair notice of the prohibited conduct and an objective standard for enforcement of violations. The court pointed out that, in order for the State to convict defendant, it had to prove that defendant had sexual contact or sexual intercourse with the mildly retarded man, that the man suffered from a mental illness or deficiency, that the mental illness or deficiency rendered the man temporarily or permanently incapable of appraising his own conduct, and that defendant knew that the man had a mental illness or deficiency which rendered him temporarily or permanently incapable of appraising his own conduct. The court was unimpressed by defendant's contention that the statute had no objective standard because he was required to think about the mildly retarded man and whether he lacked the ability to appraise the proposed activity before engaging in sexual acts with him. The court found the statutory requirement little different from requiring one to ascertain the age of a potential sexual partner before initiating sexual contact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer arrested defendant for violating &sect; 7.05 after employees of a planned parenthood clinic reported that he was standing at the clinic's driveway entrance, forcing vehicles to stop, and attempting to force pamphlets through open windows.

The appellate court held that the circuit court's review was limited under Wis.

The municipal court correctly outlined the procedures for the trial and gave defendant every opportunity to testify.

Defendant claimed that the statute unconstitutionally relieved the state from proving knowledge of the minority of the child by providing ignorance of age as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature did not intend the affirmative defense of ignorance of age of the child, set forth in &sect; 948.05(3), to apply to those violations of &sect; 948.05(1)(c) that did not concern face-to-face involvement with the child.Because defendant's charges did not concern face-to-face involvement, any burden shifting that could have resulted from the affirmative defense did not apply to his case. The court noted that the burden shifting was permissible in cases where the child's age could reasonably be ascertained, but that it would have been unreasonable to shift the burden in circumstances where it was impossible to employ any one of the statute's methods for ascertaining age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police discovered a large quantity of cash in the inmate's pockets. One of the officers asked the inmate whether he had a job. The inmate indicated that he did not. The inmate asserted that this should have been suppressed, because he had not been advised of his Miranda rights. Initially the inmate was charged with two drug sale related offenses. Because these two charges were dismissed at the time of the inmate's plea, leaving only the possession charge, the inmate's statement, which went only to the two drug sale related offenses, was found on direct appeal to have played no role in his possession conviction. The inmate argued in the instant motion that, because he entered the plea believing that he was to retain the opportunity to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress, the appellate court had to conclude that the plea was not voluntarily or knowingly entered. The inmate could not establish that he failed to enter the plea knowingly, as the statement the inmate sought to suppress was immaterial to the charge of which he was convicted. The statement the inmate made was evidence of the drug sale charges, not of possession.</SPAN></P>

Although the State conceded that the speed limit sign was improperly posted, the court held that the officer was unaware at the time of the traffic stop that the speed limit sign was illegal. The court determined that the officer had a reasonable basis to stop defendant because he observed her driving at 27 miles per hour in a 15-mile-per-hour zone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed that the ordinance, which placed permanent height and use restrictions on land outside of the city limits, was unconstitutional because it placed unreasonable restrictions upon their use of the land. They challenged the state's grant of extraterritorial zoning power to municipalities under Wis. Stat. &sect; 114.136, and claimed that under the principle of &quot;one man, one vote,&quot; they should have participated in the election of the officials responsible. On review, the court found that the state's grant of such power was constitutional because political subdivisions were states-in-miniature that were convenient agencies for exercise of the state's police powers to ensure public safety. The court noted that &quot;one man, one vote&quot; did not confer upon individuals the right to vote upon all decisions that affect them, and that state statutes were constitutional unless they rested on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the state's objective. The court affirmed and found that the common council acted within the bounds of its legislative field, had conducted two studies on land use and growth, and did no more than was authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision that terminated the mother's parental rights and determined that the provision regarding incestuous relationships served compelling state interests in the welfare of children and preservation of the family and the termination did not deny equal protection because the mother's rights were not terminated for the status but after a determination that the termination was in the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers' existing retirement benefits were converted to a service allowance plan at an age lower than the conversion-age in effect when they were hired and became members of the state employee retirement system, thus resulting in a reduction of benefits. The court held that the conversion-age rights vested when the class members were first hired and became members of the retirement system. Given the clear statewide concern to have an efficient, dependable police force functioning in the city, the city could not, under its home rule powers, reduce police-officer retirement-system benefits without the officers' consent below the level existing when the officers were hired. Chapter 441 of the Laws of 1947 &sect;&sect; 30(2) and 31 were dispositive of this issue. There was no evidence that the officers agreed to allow its union to bargain away their vested rights. The class members were not estopped from objecting to the lower conversion ages agreed to by their union. Receipt of a pension installment payment that was less than that required by contract was a separate breach of that contract and members had six years to sue on any pension installment that was less than it should have been.</SPAN></P>

The doctors treated her for a broken arm, but failed to diagnose a dislocated elbow. Four years later, the arm was x-rayed for an unrelated injury, and it was noted that the elbow was dislocated.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the doctors and their insurers based on the expiration of the statute of limitations. The child and her parents appealed.

The State filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of the parents to the child on the grounds of their incestuous parenthood. A doctor testified that the child, three-and-one-half years old, was previously non-verbal, was not toilet trained, and was not able to feed herself, but had made great progress after time with the foster family. The trial court terminated the parental rights of the parents to the child pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(7). Affirming the order, the court held that &sect; 48.415(7) was constitutional and was narrowly tailored to serve the State's compelling interests in the welfare of children, preservation of family, and maintenance of an ordered society.

The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had already determined that ordinances that prohibited loud noises on motor vehicles did not restrict the communication or discussion of ideas within the meaning of the First Amendment. The court held that a person of ordinary intelligence would have been placed on notice by the ordinance to have an adequate and properly maintained muffler so that his motorcycle could not have been heard from two blocks away.

Appellant argued that the juvenile court erred in denying his motion. The appellate court ruled that the denial of the motion to dismiss was proper, as juveniles did not have a state or federal constitutional right to a jury trial. Concerning the concealed weapon adjudication, the appellate court ruled that the State failed to set forth facts demonstrating appellant used or intended to use the razor blades in a threatening manner. Appellant's statements as to his fear for his safety were ordered suppressed, and mere possession without more was insufficient to prove concealment of a weapon.</SPAN></P>

Defendant brought a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the flag desecration statute, arguing that it was both vague and overbroad. The trial court agreed and dismissed the count of flag desecration. Defendant was convicted for the thefts. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the flag desecration statute was unconstitutional. Although defendant lacked standing to assert a vagueness challenge against the statute, and his conduct clearly and unambiguously fell within the statutory prohibition against defiling the flag, the part of the statute making it unlawful to cast contempt upon the flag was so vague as to set no standard by which defendant's conduct could be measured. &quot;Casting contempt upon the flag&quot; was language too subjective to guide enforcement of the statute as it did not give reasonable notice as to what conduct was prohibited. The statute was overbroad because the language encompassed acts that constituted protected expression and actually deterred protected expression in a real and substantial way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a felony in Iowa in 1974. He was lately convicted of offending Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.29, which criminalized firearm possession by a felon. He claimed that &sect; 941.29 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law, retroactively punishing him for the 1974 Iowa felony conviction. In affirming the judgment the court held that &sect; 941.29 was not an ex post facto law, because it did not criminalize prior conduct. The court held that &sect; 941.29 criminalized present conduct - the possession of a firearm. The court explained that the prior felony conviction was a predicate to the offense. This was simply a condition precedent to the prosecution for the current firearm possession, and did not raise ex post facto concerns. The court noted that generally a state was free to restrict felons' conduct for the protection of its citizens' health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court reasoned it need not address defendant's constitutional claims. The court found that defendant could not, by stipulating to the entry of a conditional judgment, obtain a mandatory appeal of an interlocutory order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prison committee recommended that the inmate participate in a treatment program. Eligibility in the program was conditioned upon an inmate signing a program contract. The inmate brought an action alleging the infringement of his constitutional rights and violations of state law stemming from the conditions for participation in the program. The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that the inmate failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1997e(a) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.02(7). The court affirmed. Under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1997e(a), a claim alleging violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 could not be brought if the inmate did not exhaust administrative remedies that the Department had promulgated.

Appellants sought recovery for personal injuries and alleged, among other things, that a priest at the church had sexually abused the man when, as a child, he had attended religious instruction classes at the church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The man had been abused by the priest on numerous occasions as a young teenager but did not reveal the assaults until nearly 10 years after they occurred. The priest had abused several other boys during the same time period and, because they had told their parents, the diocese removed the priest from the church. The man's parents, however, were never told why the priest was removed and, although they sought the help of professionals, never learned why their son had become troubled nor why he had attempted suicide on several occasions. Upon learning of the assaults on their son, the parents filed their claims at the time their son filed his. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, agreed that all of the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court found that, although the parents' claims were different from the man's, they were derivative and had accrued when the son's did. The court held that the causes of action had accrued on the date of the last assault and, even allowing the parents' claims the benefit of the tolling provisions relating to the son's period of minority as provided under Wis. Stat. 893.16(1), found that the claims were time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an internal investigation, the police officer was demoted and six charges for causing a disruption, hindering the efficient operation of the department, and making derogatory comments were filed with the Board, which dismissed two of the charges and upheld the demotion.

The circuit court concluded, based on the evidence that the rules were unconstitutionally vague and adequate notice of the charges were not given to the officers. The court held that the issuance of a writ was controlled by equitable principles and, in its discretion, the court would consider the rights of the public and third parties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Wood County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, while possessing a weapon, and failure to purchase drug tax stamps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to an anticipatory search warrant, an investigator stated that on a particular date there would be, upon delivery, a shipping package containing 20 pounds of marijuana at defendant's address, or upon the persons at that address. The warrant further stated that the investigator asked for a no-knock warrant to search the premises for the marijuana and drug paraphernalia. The court held that reversal of the drug tax stamp conviction was required because the drug tax stamp law had been found unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the right against self-incrimination. However, the court determined that the anticipatory search warrant was constitutionally sufficient because it clearly implied that the search was not to commence until the marijuana was delivered. Until delivery, the contraband for which the warrant was issued would not be on the premises. The court did not believe that the warrant could be misunderstood by officers as allowing a search of the premises before delivery. The court concluded that remand was required because the trial court determined that the no-knock warrant was justified under the blanket exception of a case that had been overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) convicting him, after a jury trial, of possession of a controlled substance, second or subsequent offense; obstructing or resisting an officer; and failure to pay controlled substance tax and denying his postconviction motion for a new trial. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in presiding over the matter because he had filed a timely substitution motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also argued on appeal that his conviction for failing to pay a controlled substance tax violated his constitutional rights against compelled self-incrimination and double jeopardy. On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court committed reversible error in presiding over defendant's trial and that defendant's conviction for violating the drug stamp law could not stand. The court reversed and remanded. The court noted that the Wisconsin Supreme Court had recently struck down the drug stamp law as unconstitutional. The court further found that the record reflected that once defendant found out that the judge was to preside over his case, he filed a substitution motion. Although the motion was filed after the arraignment deadline prescribed in Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.20(4), the deadline should have been relaxed because the intake system did not provide adequate notice of the assigned judge in advance of arraignment. Accordingly, the court concluded that defendant's substitution motion was timely filed. It was, therefore, reversible error for the judge to preside over defendant's trial. On remand, the court directed the new trial was to be held before a different trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recycling ordinance required all recyclables collected in municipalities that had designated the county as the &quot;responsible unit&quot; to be delivered to the Waupaca County Processing Facility pursuant to &sect; 20.15(1). The transporter operated its own certified processing facility. After receiving 33 citations for failing to deliver recyclable materials to the county processing facility in violation of the ordinance, the transporter filed an action for declaratory judgment challenging the validity and constitutionality of the county ordinance. The trial court held that ch. 20 and related provisions of &sect; 20.22 of the ordinance were invalid and unenforceable. The court affirmed. The Commerce Clause applied because the county's flow control ordinance was market regulation. The ordinance allowed only one processor to process the waste for the municipalities that had designated the county as the responsible unit, thereby precluding all other in-state and all out-of-state businesses from performing the service. The county had available nondiscriminatory measures to address the health and safety issues posed by waste disposal and to insure the financial viability of its processing facility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant boathouse owner brought an action against respondent Oneida County, seeking review of the denial of his application for a permit to reconstruct his wet boathouse. While the owner's appeal was pending, Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.121(3r), permitting the rebuilding of wet boathouses, was enacted. The Circuit Court for Oneida County (Wisconsin) concluded that &sect; 30.121(3r) was an unconstitutional private bill, and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's application for reconstruction of his wet boathouse was denied pursuant to a County zoning ordinance, which precluded such reconstruction when the cost exceeded 50 percent of the value of the property destroyed. The owner contended that the zoning ordinance was preempted by Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.121(3r), which provided that prohibitions against the building or reconstruction of wet boathouses when the cost exceeded 50 percent of the equalized assessed value did not apply to wet boathouses damaged by violent wind, vandalism, or fire after January 1, 1984. On review, the court held that &sect; 30.121(3r) was constitutional and preempted the County's zoning ordinance. The statute was not a private bill because it applied to all wet boathouses in the State of Wisconsin destroyed by violent wind, vandalism, or fire. The classification created by the selection of a date prior to which rebuilding or repair was not permitted was reasonable, as was the limitation to specific natural forces. The statute's modification of law to change judicial results was a proper legislative action and did not violate the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied both motions. After a stipulated bench trial, the trial court entered a judgment of conviction and a forfeiture order, but the time to appeal had elapsed by the time the parties received notice of the order. After additional procedural questions were resolved, the trial court conducted a new trial, again convicting the owner, and again imposing the forfeiture. The owner appealed. The court first held that the trial court properly granted the owner a new trial given the circumstances of the case. The court then affirmed the trial court's refusal of the owner's suppression motion, holding that the stop of the truck and the detainment of the driver were made with probable cause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a sting operation, the owner asked an undercover officer to load stolen merchandise in the trunk of the owner's car. The trial court granted plaintiff State of Wisconsin's demand for forfeiture of the car under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.075(1)(b) and denied a motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the court agreed that the forfeiture implicated the protections guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause, but concluded that the forfeiture did not violate the Eighth Amendment. In so holding, the court first noted that a forfeiture under &sect; 973.075(1)(b) was a punishment subject to the limitations of the Excessive Fines Clause. As to whether the forfeiture in the instant case was &quot;excessive&quot; within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, the case presented an issue of first impression. Using a 1954 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision, the court concluded that the so-called Seraphine multi-factor standard was to be used when analyzing whether a forfeiture of a vehicle under &sect; 973.075(1)(b) was &quot;excessive&quot; within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. Under that standard, the forfeiture was not excessive because it was neither disproportionate to the crime nor unusual in nature.</SPAN></P>

Because a single-family neighborhood was nearby, and because the condition of the property violated &sect;&sect; 10.01, 10.02, 10.05, the town filed a public nuisance action against the landowners. The town filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted as to all claims except one. A trial was had on that final claim and the jury found for the landowners. The trial court granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The landowners appealed. On review, the court found that summary judgment was rightly granted because one of the adjacent landowners did not file an affidavit disputing the town's claims, while the other landowner's affidavit contained entirely conclusory statements. Finally, the court agreed with the trial court in setting aside the jury verdict because the landowners did not have a valid and legal nonconforming use of their properties.

The appeals were consolidated by the court and transferred for decision by a three-judge panel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant separately claimed that his trial court erred in its failure to suppress the breath test results from an untested, unevaluated, and unapproved test instrument. The instrument included components of an approved model and contained replacement parts from an unapproved model where the model was obsolete. The first defendant was convicted of a first offense of both OMVPAC and OMVWI. The second defendant was convicted of a second offense of OMVPAC and OMVWI. The court held that: (1) where test results were obtained using an instrument not evaluated and approved as required by in Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(6)(b) and Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Trans 311.04 (1993), the results were no longer entitled to automatic admissibility or to a prima facie presumption of accuracy to establish a defendant's blood alcohol level; and (2) in such cases, prosecutors who wished to rely upon the breath test results were required to present evidence of the instrument's scientific accuracy and reliability and prove compliance with accepted scientific methods as a foundation for the admission of the test results.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused to produce identification and left. A few days later a university police officer was dispatched to a campus library after an employee received complaints defendant was watching pornographic material. The officer asked for identification and defendant was arrested and issued a citation. On appeal, the court held it would not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact unless the evidence, viewed most favorably to the State and conviction, was so lacking in probative value that no trier of fact acting reasonably, could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected defendant's claim that the police provoked him, and that the police asking defendant for identification did not qualify as provocation. The court held it was true that when a police officer required a person to identify himself and prevented him from leaving, the officer performed a seizure subject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. However, defendant was free to leave the library and thus his arrest was lawful.</SPAN></P>

He received a stayed prison term and was placed on conditional probation. However he was cited for various violations of his probation and it was revoked. The petitioner argued that the probation condition requiring him to discuss and receive approval from his probation agent before he engaged in an intimate relationship with an adult female was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the revocation of the petitioner's probation and held that the intimate contact condition was both reasonable, not overly broad, and related to the petitioner's rehabilitation. Although it may have been a constriction of a constitutional right, it was not a denial of it. The condition was rationally related to the petitioner's rehabilitation because it forced him to be honest with others by confronting and admitting to his sexually deviant behavior. Moreover, it served to protect the public. The court concluded that it was absurd for the petitioner to presuppose that he could select which treatment program he was willing to attend.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the petition and held that there was a substantial likelihood that the mother would not meet the conditions for the return of her children within the twelve-month period following the fact-finding hearing. On appeal, the mother ascribed error to the trial court's injunction halting her visitation with the children issued one month before trial and its refusal to admit certain post-petition evidence. She also maintained that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2) was unconstitutional as applied to her. In affirming the judgment, the court concluded that there was no abuse of discretion in issuing the injunction and that the error in refusing to admit the post-petition evidence was harmless error. In addition, &sect; 48.415(2) was constitutional because there were sufficient facts to warrant termination of rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Wis.

The applicant sought a conditional use variance after the ordinance was adopted but submitted it to the county board rather than to the village board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and the father entered into a stipulation resolving all issues in the paternity action.

Stat. &sect; 46.255(1) (1993-94), providing for the placement of a lien on income tax returns, was amended to apply to those who owed an outstanding amount in birth expense payments as of June 11, 1994. Where the department of revenue intercepted the father's tax returns, the trial court found that the State was not permitted to not fulfill the stipulation that it had made with the father and that application of former &sect; 46.255(1) was a violation of due process. The issue concerning former &sect; 46.255(1) was moot, because the father was paid the intercepted refund. The issue was not reviewable under an exception to the mootness doctrine. Former &sect; 446.255(1) may not have applied to the case, as it was not enacted until after the father entered the stipulations.

The court ruled that the allegations were sufficient to state a claim for relief on the ground that the zoning amendment deprived the landowners of either the equal protection of the laws or substantive due process because it was arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory. The court concluded, however, that the complaint did not state a claim for a taking under the federal or state constitutional. The landowners alleged neither the use they made under the previous zoning of rural development, nor the actual or anticipated uses that they no longer had. The allegations were thus insufficient to state a claim for that relief. The court further determined that the landowners' claim for a violation of their right to a fair and impartial hearing adequately asserted violations of a right secured by the federal constitution such that the requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(1) did not apply, just as it did not apply to their equal protection and denial of due process claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the landowner's claim for regulatory taking without just compensation. The court reversed the dismissal of the claim that the amended zoning ordinance deprived them of due process and equal protection of the law and their claim for a violation of their right to a fair and impartial hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State's criminalization of consensual sexual relations with children under age sixteen violated both his constitutional privacy right to engage in sexual activity and his privacy right to make decisions regarding procreation. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court rejected his argument that because Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(2) infringed upon his right to procreate it had to pass the strict scrutiny test. On the contrary, the court held that sexual conduct involving minors was not to be judged by the same rules as those which governed adults and that, consequently, only a &quot;significant state interest&quot;, not a compelling one, was required to support the age-based distinction contained in &sect; 948.02(2). Finding that the State had a strong interest in the ethical and moral development of its children, the court held that &sect; 948.02(2) prohibited defendant's right to privacy as an adult from being enlarged to include sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 16. The court also rejected defendant's argument that his sentence was based on the improper factor of uncharged crimes in that it considered unproven charges of sexual molestation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence and held that the statute criminalizing sexual conduct with a child under 16 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for driving without Wisconsin license plates and also because the police had information that he was transporting cocaine. Cocaine was discovered in the car, and defendant was subsequently convicted. On appeal, the court ruled that because the Supreme Court of Wisconsin had recently struck down the drug tax stamp law as unconstitutional, defendant' conviction on that charge was reversed. As to the cocaine charges, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that both the stop and the scope of defendant's detention were lawful. The additional intrusion of asking defendant to step out of his car was de minimus. The court declined to review defendant's coercion argument, that he did not voluntarily consent to the search of his car, as defendant's repeated denial at the suppression hearing that he consented foreclosed the argument on appeal that he gave consent but that it was coerced. The court disagreed with defendant's claim that the trial court did not allow him to cross-examine a detective regarding the issue of consent. The trial court did not deny the cross-examination but, instead, merely exercised its discretion by limiting the cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant properly received an enhanced penalty under Wis.

The court also held that where there was no evidence that the State had brought additional charges that were of doubtful merit, his claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness could not prevail.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Jefferson County (Wisconsin), convicted defendant of possession of drug paraphernalia following the denial of her motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of an automobile in which she was a passenger. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether a search incident to the arrest of one occupant of a stopped vehicle extended to the private property of any non-arrested occupants. Defendant contended that it was unreasonable to search her private property absent probable cause that she had committed a crime or that evidence might have been destroyed. The envelope at issue was large enough to conceal a weapon or evidence of a crime, and it was easily within the arrested driver's reach prior to the time he stepped out of the vehicle. Defendant left the envelope on the front passenger floorboard when she exited the vehicle. Therefore, the envelope was within an area from which the driver might have gained possession of a weapon or destructible evidence at the time of the search. The ownership of the envelope was irrelevant to the safety of the officers, or the reasonableness of their search. Therefore, the envelope was properly searched incident to the driver's arrest, notwithstanding any privacy interests that defendant might have claimed in its contents, and defendant's suppression motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant child, by his guardian ad litem, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in a paternity action brought by the child against respondent father. Respondent mother was also a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child challenged the trial court's determination of child support that his father was obligated to pay. On appeal, the court concluded that retroactive application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.51(4) did not violate the father's protection against ex post facto laws or the rule favoring prospective application of substantive legislation and, further, that by its explicit terms, Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.51(4) applied to the father's liability for past support of the child for the period after the child's birth despite the father's lack of knowledge of the child's existence. The court concluded further that the trial court improperly based its deviation from the percentage standard and refusal to order past support on an impermissible factor, inconsistent with the mandate of &sect; 767.51(5). The trial court erred in calculating the father's income for purposes of setting the child's support by applying marital property principles and simply presuming the father's income to be one-half of his and his wife's joint income. Additionally, the trial court erred in determining child support with the expectation that it could modify the order after the child reached adulthood to account for his college costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order of paternity, but remanded for further proceedings to properly determine past support for the approximate 15 years preceding the paternity action, and &quot;future&quot; support for the approximate 3 years from the commencement of that action to the time of the child's adulthood.</SPAN></P>

The individual purchased the land in 1964 when it was zoned A-1 Agricultural. A-1 Agricultural zoning would have permitted the individual to make that division. However, in May of 1981, the town adopted a land use plan in preparation for a blanket rezoning, and adopted Zoning Ordinance No. 2807, which rezoned all of the A-1 Agricultural lands in the town to A-1 Agricultural Exclusive. A-1 Agricultural Exclusive zoning did not permit the land division the individual sought to accomplish. If the zoning administrator interpreted the ordinance as the individual requested, the individual claimed that it would have allowed him to divide his property. The individual sought to expand the jurisdiction of the zoning board it by requesting it to determine that the application of A-1 Agricultural Exclusive zoning to his parcel was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant first argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.025(2) rendered the statute unconstitutional by depriving him of his state constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict. The court first decided that defendant's claim did in fact attack the face of the statute and therefore was properly before it. However, the court concluded that there was no merit in the attack. When the charged behavior constituted one continuous course of conduct, the requirement of jury unanimity was satisfied regardless of whether there was agreement among jurors as to which act constituted the crime charged. The unanimity requirement was met whether multiple acts could have been said to constitute one continuous unlawful event and chargeable as to one count. Next, defendant asserted that he should have been allowed to withdraw his no contest plea because he did not understand the charge against him and thus his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of possession of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with intent to deliver more than 2500 grams within 1000 feet of a school, violation of the drug tax stamp law, maintaining a drug house, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant also appealed an order denying postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first reversed defendant's conviction under the drug tax stamp law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 139.89. The drug stamp law, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 139.87-139.96, was unconstitutional because it violated the constitutional right against self-incrimination. Defendant also contended that a tobacco pipe could not be the basis for a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia under Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.573. The pipe contained residue of THC. The court held that tobacco pipes were plainly excluded from the definition of drug paraphernalia in Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.571(1)(b). Although the plain language of the statute led to a result that was seemingly at odds with the general purpose of the statute, the court simply applied the clear language of the statute to the facts presented. The court also held that the jury could reasonably have found that defendant possessed more than 2500 grams of THC with intent to deliver. In calculating the weight pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.41(1r), the court included the stems or branches supporting the marijuana leaves or buds and excluded the mature stalk or main axis of the marijuana plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and the order denying relief for possession of THC with intent to deliver and for maintaining a drug house. The court reversed defendant's convictions and the order denying relief for possession of drug paraphernalia and under the drug tax stamp law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company, which operated a nightclub, sought to showcase non-obscene nude and semi-nude performers. The ordinance in question banned such performances. The company sought a preliminary injunction banning the ordinance's enforcement, but the trial court found in the town's favor. The court certified the appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court for further consideration. The court noted the case law on the subject differed. One published opinion found unconstitutional an ordinance banning nude dancing in licensed establishments. Another published opinion upheld an ordinance that banned nude performances on premises licensed to sell liquor. In light of the fact that the court did not have the power to overrule, modify, or withdraw language of previously published decisions, the court found that certification of the appeal was appropriate. The court rejected the town's issue regarding the company's alleged failure to serve a notice of claim pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80 because case law barred application of the statute to claims made pursuant to the U.S. Constitution, as was the claim in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police received a tip that someone using defendant's phone was selling cocaine.

When a package arrived, the police asked the shipper to hold onto it temporarily. A drug-sniffing dog alerted on the package, a search warrant was obtained, and cocaine was discovered. Defendant was subsequently arrested when he accepted delivery of the package. Defendant challenged his convictions and asserted that the drug stamp tax law conviction was unconstitutional and that the temporary detention of the package, which provided the basis for the search warrant, was improper. The court reversed the tax stamp conviction because the tax stamp statute had been ruled unconstitutional by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. It affirmed the drug possession conviction. The trial court did not err in finding that the police had properly verified the information supplied by the tipster and that the information provided a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the detention of the package. The procedure utilized involved minimal invasion of defendant's privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators leased property for the purpose of opening an adult bookstore. At the same time, the town amended its zoning ordinances and placed special restrictions on such establishments. Under the new ordinances, the operators could not open the bookstore in the desired location, and there was no area of town zoned to allow the bookstore. The operators filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance and opened the bookstore anyway. In the civil forfeiture proceeding brought by the town, the circuit court ruled for the town. On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's finding that the operators did not have standing to raise their First Amendment arguments. In reviewing the merits of those arguments, the court determined that the town had the burden of proving that its actions did not impermissibly infringe on the operator's First Amendment rights. The town erred in effectively creating a total ban on the bookstores; therefore, the court reversed the applicable forfeitures. The court found evidence to support the town's forfeiture based on plumbing violations. The town was incorrectly awarded attorneys' fees for the forfeiture proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the forfeiture based on the operators' plumbing violations, but the court reversed the judgment against the operators for violations of the other zoning and building codes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to a halfway house after he was convicted of burglary. He left the halfway house to visit his mother. After he was returned to Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Division of Intensive Services (DIS) sanctioned defendant with six-months of confinement in a correctional institution. Thereafter, defendant was charged with escape. He filed a motion for postconviction relief, arguing that the conviction for escape was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. In affirming, the court determined that defendant did not meet his burden of showing that the sanction and the subsequent conviction were unconstitutional. The court determined that the DIS sanction was not punishment. The primary purpose of the sanction was not punishment. Therefore, the fact that a punitive motive was present did not make the action punishment. Further, any punishment that defendant received was attributable to the burglary conviction. It was not considered punishment for the offense of escape because the change in placement related to the conditions imposed upon the burglary conviction. Finally, both the administrative sanction and the subsequent conviction were authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 301.048.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the district did not exceed its authority. Because &sect; 66.60(10) stated that a reassessment could be made whenever the first assessment was void for any reason, it followed that as long as the assessment could have been levied in the first instance, the fact that it was defective for noncompliance with statutory procedures did not prevent correction of the error by reassessment. The district's ability to reassess was not limited to situations in which construction had not yet commenced. Although the district had no independent authority to alter its boundaries, it properly requested the town board to do so. The court rejected the property owners' estoppel argument. The property owners' due process rights were not violated because they had the same rights to appear and voice their support or opposition at the reassessment hearing as they did in original assessment proceedings.

Stat. &sect; 59.97(6); (4) Wis. Stat. &sect; 68 did not apply to the residents' appeal by operation of Wis.

The offender appealed these orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender had seven prior convictions for sexual offenses against children. The appellate court rejected his claims that the sexual predator act, Wis. Stat. ch. 980, was unconstitutional under the substantive due process, equal protection, double jeopardy, ex post facto law, or cruel and unusual punishment provisions. Miranda did not apply, as a ch. 980 proceeding was civil, and there was no custodial interrogation. Counsel was not ineffective for: (1) failing to challenge an instruction on the effect of the verdict, as she was concerned the jury would be reluctant to find the offender was not sexually violent if it believed he would be released without supervision, and this was a reasonable tactic; (2) failing to challenge testimony by the State's experts, as it was admissible; (3) failing to present expert witnesses on the reliability of the underlying science of predicting future dangerousness, because she did search for such witnesses, but hit dead ends; (4) failing to present learned treatises, as they contained information both helpful and harmful to the defense; and (5) conceding that the offender was a proper subject for commitment, as this was a reasonable strategy.</SPAN></P>

The father stipulated that grounds existed for the termination of his parental rights, and the lower court found that the father had good grounds for believing that the child was his issue at the time the child was born. The lower court found that the termination of the father's parental rights was in the best interest of the child, and the court affirmed the lower court's order. The court held that the lower court's finding that the father had good grounds to know that the child was his was not against the great weight of the evidence. The court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6)(a)2 did not violate his rights to due process and equal protection because he had no good grounds to claim ignorance of his fatherhood, and, thus, no grounds to claim that women had an unfair advantage over men in termination proceedings on account of their knowledge of their own parenthood.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant dealt in slot machines. On appeal, he contended that slot machines could be possessed for sale to Indian tribal casinos, that federal law preempted the Wisconsin gambling statute, that he had permission to possess the gambling devices, that the statute he was convicted under was unconstitutional, and that the facts did not support the charge. The court affirmed. Defendant's appellate brief failed to meet minimal standards. It contained undeveloped or improperly explained arguments, which were unsupported by citation to authority and did not include references to the record. Additionally, many of defendant's arguments were waived through his voluntary no contest plea to the charge. Defendant's argument that there was no factual basis to support the crime to which he entered the no contest plea also failed. Defendant agreed that the facts in the complaint against him as well as those presented in his preliminary hearing could be used as a factual basis for the plea. Further, defendant failed to bring his claim in a postconviction motion to the trial court. Therefore, the argument could not be addressed in an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed an action against respondent father to terminate his parental rights to the parties' infant daughter. The Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin), in terminating the father's rights, determined that he exhibited a pattern of abusive behavior that threatened the child's health, and that he failed to establish a substantial parental relationship with the child. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that because at one point he was the child's primary caretaker, he could not be found to have failed to assume parental responsibility. He also contended that the trial court did not have jurisdiction because it failed to adjudicate his paternity prior to trial. The judgment was affirmed. The court held that (1) the jury had ample evidence to support its determination that the father did not establish a parental relationship with the child, and (2) the fact that the father's paternity had yet to be adjudicated at the time of trial did not affect the validity of the verdict and the dispositional order. The court noted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6) contained a non-exclusive list of factors considered to establish a substantial parental relationship. Although the father did take care of the child shortly after her birth, the evidence revealed several instances of abusive behavior wherein the child sustained bruises, broken ribs, and a closed head injury caused by shaken baby syndrome. The fact that there were positive, as well as negative, contacts did not bar the jury from concluding that the father did not establish a parental relationship with his daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the sentencing court had no authority to order the immediate commencement a five-year prison sentence on his battery conviction because he had not been discharged from his prior commitment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.17. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's sentence and conviction upon finding that immediate commencement of defendant's prison sentence on his battery conviction was authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.15, although the denomination of it as concurrent to the prior commitment was not. The sentencing court erred in ordering the prison sentence on the battery conviction to be concurrent with defendant's not guilty by insanity commitment because the prior commitment was not a sentence under state law. The fact that defendant was found not guilty of certain offenses in 1975 by reason of mental disease or defect, however, did not render him immune from the present imposition of criminal penalties for a new offense. Defendant's claim that his classification as a prisoner for purposes of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.20(1) violated his constitutional right to equal protection, which was raised for the first time on appeal, was not subject to appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The OCI revoked the insurance agent's license and imposed a forfeiture of $ 10,000 after he violated various statutes by distributing health insurance pamphlets that were found to be misleading. The trial court upheld the OCI's order. On appeal, the court found no merit to the agent's claim that the OCI acted unconstitutionally and abused its discretion by revoking his license as retaliation for his exercise of his First Amendment rights. The record showed that the OCI began investigating the agent before he ever spoke out against a rule change. The court could not say that the matter was not handled as promptly as possible under the circumstances. Finally, the court concluded that the OCI acted within the scope of its discretion in imposing the sanctions against the agent. The evidence amply supported the OCI's findings that the agent committed multiple statutory and rule violations, attempted to impede its investigation, and evaded and misrepresented the truth regarding his activities. Based upon the findings, as well as the strong public policy interest in protecting senior citizens from misleading insurance sales practices, the sanctions imposed were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A six-year-old girl was walking down the aisle of an open-air horse barn at a county fair. She sustained serious injuries when a horse on exhibit at the fair kicked her in the head. The girl's parents brought an action against defendants. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that they were immune under the provisions of the recreational immunity law found in Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.52. The court found that the girl waived her argument that the statute was unconstitutional because she failed to raise it at trial. The court also found that defendant owner of the horse was not an &quot;owner&quot; within the meaning of the Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.52 (1)(d). Accordingly the court reversed the part of the trial court's judgment that dismissed the action against the horse owner. The court affirmed in all other respects. The court found that the trial court did not err as a matter of law in finding that the girl was engaged in a recreational activity.

Third-party defendant claimed that its failure to timely answer the third-party complaint was the result of excusable neglect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence showed that third-party defendant received the third-party complaint and summons, forwarded them to a claims handler, who sent them to an out-of-state processing office. A technician determined that third-party defendant was not the insurance carrier on the trailer in question and forwarded the papers to a claims processor, who never followed up. The trial court granted third-party plaintiff's motion for a default judgment and then refused to vacate the judgment. On appeal, the court rejected third-party defendant's claim of excusable neglect and concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vacate the judgment. Excusable neglect was not synonymous with neglect, carelessness, or inattentiveness, but was neglect that might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances. Third-party defendant was a large and sophisticated insurance company with experience in litigation, and it did not establish that the complaint was processed in any unusual way. It thus failed to establish excusable neglect. Issues of a party's defense or of fairness only had to be considered after excusable neglect was established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which had denied third-party defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment that had been entered in favor of third-party insurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners appealed from a dismissal of their complaint alleging that the town's system of property tax assessment was unfair.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the action could not be maintained without initial compliance with the statutory mandates for review by the Board of Review.

He also appealed from the trial court's order denying his request for a new trial. The court affirmed. Defendant contended that the trial court exceeded the scope of the court's remand order because it did not limit its consideration to the PEP A test. The court disagreed, stating that it was not only reasonable, but also prudent of the trial court to review all of the evidence in order to make a determination not only because an absolute exclusion would have required a new trial, but also because an absolute exclusion might have meant that defendant was not guilty of the crimes charged. Given the purpose of the hearing, the court could not conclude that the nature of the remand hearing was an erroneous exercise of discretion. There was no error in allowing the DNA evidence to be introduced at the remand hearing.</SPAN></P>

The county cross-appealed the judgment. The property alleged violations of the Due Process and Takings Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sued the county seeking to void a tax foreclosure and sale of a parcel of non-homestead property they owned in the county and to recover monetary damages and attorney fees on several theories.

The owners did not defend the action and, after obtaining a foreclosure judgment, the county sold the property and retained the entire amount of the sale proceeds. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to enter judgment dismissing the owners' action. The court held as follows: 1) the county was entitled to retain the excess proceeds of the sale because the State's constitution and tax codes were silent as to the distribution of excess proceeds received in a tax sale and notice of the action met due process requirements; and 2) the notices received by the owners were reasonably calculated to apprise them of the pendency of the foreclosure action, afforded them an opportunity to present their objections, and were thus constitutionally adequate.</SPAN></P>

He also asserted the seizure of his car was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, a fifth offense. After reaching a plea agreement with the district attorney's office, he pled guilty and was sentenced. The judgment of conviction included 12 months of jail time, a fine, and revocation of his operator's license for three years. Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(6) required the court to seize his vehicle. The State requested that the court conduct a review hearing on the matter because the police had not yet located the vehicle. Defendant moved to vacate the seizure order based on his contention that &sect; 346.65(6) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held the trial court properly included the legislatively-mandated penalty in the judgment of conviction. The forfeiture hearing and the due process guarantees which attach to it did not commence until the vehicle was seized. Defendant could have raised the issue of the constitutionality of the forfeiture of his motor vehicle through a timely appeal from the judgment of conviction. Because the forfeiture action was a separate action which was commenced after the vehicle was seized, &sect; 346.65 afforded defendant another opportunity to contest its legality.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also denied defendant's postconviction motion.

During execution of the search warrant at defendant's residence, the officers discovered, among other things, approximately 48.5 pounds of marijuana. Defendant argued that Wis.

The Town challenged the action, arguing that the corporation was required to seek review under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.47(13), and it asked the trial court to construe the action as one for certiorari that was limited to reviewing the record generated before the board of review. The trial court rejected the Town's argument, and the Town sought leave to appeal. The appellate court held that: (1) Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(3)(d) permitted taxpayers to seek a trial de novo when the taxpayer claimed that a tax imposed by a municipality was excessive, and the trial court's judgment rejecting the Town's argument that the corporation had to proceed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.47(13) was correct; and (2) the Town lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(3)(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the corporation's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 343.12(2)(d), which required the Department of Transportation to suspend defendant's school bus operator's license upon his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, did not violate the equal protection, cruel and unusual punishment, and due process provisions of the federal and Wisconsin constitutions. The legislature could rationally distinguish between school bus drivers and other drivers based on a legitimate interest in protecting children from harm while being transported on school buses. There was no equal protection violation. The license suspension under &sect; 343.12(2)(d) was an administrative sanction rather than a criminal sentence. Hence, the granting of a commercial license was a privilege, not an inherent right. There was no cruel and unusual punishment. The police officer's failure to read defendant the entire &quot;Informing the Accused&quot; form did not require the suppression of the chemical breath test results. There was no due process violation. The remaining due process claims, based on ex post facto considerations, were merely moot hypothetical situations that never came to pass.</SPAN></P>

DCDH had terminated respondent mother's Aid to Families with Dependant Children (AFDC) grant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and her daughter constituted an AFDC assistance unit and received $ 440 per month in AFDC benefits. The mother's partner and their two-year-old child lived with them. The partner was not the daughter's natural, adoptive, or stepfather. In January 1993 the partner began to draw monthly unemployment compensation of $ 652. DCHS determined that upon the partner's unemployment, the two-year old child became a &quot;dependent child.&quot; DCHS added both the partner and the two-year old to the mother's &quot;filing unit&quot; and concluded that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 607(b)(1)(B)(iv) required that it deduct the partner's monthly unemployment compensation from the benefit. Because the partner's unemployment compensation exceeded the assistance standard, DCHS terminated the mother and the daughter's AFDC grant. The Department affirmed, but the trial court reversed. On appeal, the court held that DCHS incorrectly added the two-year old and the partner to the mother's assistance unit. The court held that a child meeting all other eligibility requirements did not qualify for AFDC when her parent became unemployed but was paid unemployment compensation exceeding the state's level of assistance.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Ordinance &sect; 3.23(4)(a) when the roommates refused to rent a room to respondent tenant on the basis of her sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant sought to rent a room from the roommates. The roommates declined to rent the tenant a room based on her sexual orientation. The MEOC and the trial court found that the roommates violated &sect; 3.23(4)(a) when they declined to rent the room to the tenant. The roommates appealed. The court held that applying &sect; 3.23(4) to the rental of a room within a house with shared common areas was not unreasonable or absurd. The trial court was correct in not considering the roommates' argument that &sect; 3.23 was unconstitutional because they failed to notify the attorney general of their challenge, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11). However, the roommates' notice to the attorney general subsequent to the trial court's decision cured the defect. The roommates gave up their unqualified right to constitutional protection when they rented housing for profit. The restrictions placed by the city on persons who rent housing for profit were neither unreasonable nor encroached upon the roommates' constitutional protections. Madison, Wis. Gen. Ordinance &sect; 3.23 did not explicitly authorize MEOC to award compensatory or punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which affirmed the decision of the MEOC that the roommates violated city ordinance when they declined to rent a room to the tenant based on her sexual orientation.

The landlord appealed his conviction, arguing that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; ATCP 134, under which he was charged, was unconstitutionally vague.

The court found that the regulation sufficiently delineated landlord conduct that was violative and provided clear standards for enforcement.

The developers then filed another action against the city alleging the taking of land without just compensation, breach of the developers' agreements, and fraudulent conduct by the city regarding sanitary sewer charges, water main connection charges and water fees. The circuit court dismissed the action as barred by claim preclusion. On appeal the developers argued that the action was related to different utilities. They also contended that the causes of action were different because the first suit questioned the city's exercise of discretion and the second suit sought damages for breach of contract, fraud, and unconstitutional appropriation of land. The court concluded that the doctrine of claim preclusion barred the action. In both actions the developers sought reimbursement of certain costs when the developers' agreement provided otherwise. The court was not persuaded that each breach of the contract was a separate cause of action.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the trial court's order on appeal, the court found that the company failed to meet its burden of establishing by clear and cogent evidence that the apportionment formula attributed income to the state of Wisconsin out of proportion to business transacted in the state or resulted in grossly distorted figures. The court stated there was no suggestion in Wis. Admin. Code &sect; [Tax] 2.46 that arrivals and departures should have been weighted. Additionally, the court stated that Wis.

Defendant challenged the trial court's jury instructions, its exclusion of certain evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence to convict, and the effectiveness of his trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victims' mother had a contentious relationship regarding the custody of their two daughters. Defendant denied having sexually assaulted the daughters and alleged that the mother made the victims fabricate stories of abuse. The court agreed that the trial court should have allowed defendant to present certain evidence regarding the mother's past behavior to show that the mother's conduct exhibited a pattern of preventing the daughters from having a father around. However, because only part of the evidence had been excluded, the court held that the error was harmless. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the trial court's supplemental instruction to the jury on agreement, which was given after 16 hours of deliberation. Given the length and complexity of the trial, the court held that it was within the trial court's discretion to give the instruction and that it was not error to permit the victims' mother to be present in the courtroom at the time it was given. There was also sufficient evidence to support the conviction. No basis was found for defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</SPAN></P>

Defendant petitioned the Milwaukee County Circuit Court for a trial de novo, which the trial court granted. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the &quot;dangerous per se&quot; language of the ordinance created an irrebuttable mandatory presumption, thereby violating the due process and equal protection provisions of the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions and conflicting with state law and public policy. The trial court rejected defendant's constitutional claims, found him guilty of violating the ordinance, and entered a forfeiture judgment for $ 269 or 10 days in jail.

The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the city ordinance disallowing the sale of alcohol by a gas station and granted the city a summary judgment of dismissal. The applicant appealed the summary judgment of dismissal, and the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance did not deny equal protection because the classification was reasonably related to a legitimate purpose of limiting the availability of alcohol to drivers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five girls, ranging in age from five to ten years and including two of defendant's children, testified that defendant had either molested or had sexual intercourse with them.

The court refused to hear defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because no evidentiary hearing at the trial level with defendant's attorney present was held.

The alleged conversation between defendant's girlfriend and the mother of one of the victim's that someone put the victim up to making the accusations did not rise to the level of manifest injustice. The testimony of five victims made it unlikely that defendant would receive a different result. The court refused to take judicial notice that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02 was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff church member sued defendants, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison and one of its priests, claiming that the priest, who was assigned by the Diocese as a hospital chaplain and counselor, used his position to engage her in a sexual relationship. The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) granted the Diocese's motion for summary judgment, and the church member appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church member sought recovery from the Diocese on several grounds, alleging that: (1) the Diocese was negligent in its supervision of the priest; and (2) the Diocese was vicariously liable for the priest's actions under (a) the common-law rule of respondeat superior and (b) Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.70, which created a civil cause of action for one incurring injury resulting from sexual contact with a &quot;therapist.&quot; The court reversed the trial court's judgment on the negligent supervision claim. A determination of the standard of care owed by the Diocese would not necessarily violate the First Amendment prohibition against excessive entanglement of church and state, as the trial court had held. However, because unresolved factual issues were central to this claim, summary judgment was improper. The court affirmed the remainder of the trial court's judgment. The priest's sexual relationship with the church member was beyond the scope of his employment, and therefore, the Diocese could not be held liable based on respondeat superior. Because the cause of action provided by &sect; 895.70 related to the therapist only, the Diocese could not be held vicariously liable under its terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment dismissing the church member's claim against the Diocese for negligent supervision of the priest and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on that issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 813.125, defendant was enjoined from harassing an individual in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.013 and a complaint was thereafter filed alleging that defendant made four harassing phone calls to the individual. Defendant was convicted of violating the injunction and challenged the conviction after the trial court denied his motion for postconviction relief. The court held that defendant was not denied due process of law, reasoning that Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.125 was not unconstitutionally vague because it prohibited certain behaviors specifically enumerated in Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.013 that were deemed to be harassing. The court further reasoned that because &sect; 947.013 was sufficiently specific in advising defendant what behavior were prohibited, the injunction prohibiting defendant from violating &sect; 947.013 was therefore sufficiently specific. The court further held that the failure of the prosecution to specifically allege a course of conduct intended to harass was not fatal because the complaint referenced &sect; 947.013, which made such an intent an element of the crime charged. The court concluded that defendant was sufficiently advised of the elements of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 939.62(2m)(b), Wisconsin's &quot;three-strikes&quot; law, mandated life imprisonment without parole for three-time serious felony offenders. Defendant contended that the trial court's imposition of mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole pursuant to &sect; 939.62(2m)(b) was unconstitutional. Defendant also argued that he was denied due process when the trial court failed to afford him the right of allocution at sentencing. In affirming, the court held that defendant failed to prove that &sect; 939.62(2m)(b) was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. According to the court, &sect; 939.62(2m)(b) did not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the separation of powers doctrine, or the equal protection doctrine. The court also determined that although the trial court erred when it failed to afford defendant the right of allocution at sentencing, there was no reasonable possibility that the trial court's error contributed to defendant's sentence.

Notice was sent to the landowners' attorney that he needed to file an appearance in order for the landowners to be a party to the action. The attorney failed to do so. The commissioners ruled to condemn the land for the purpose of putting a road on the land. The court rejected the landowners' claims that Wis.

All the problems complained of by the landowners, such as that the statutes did not require deference to the town board's decision, that there were no mechanisms for ensuring that a person whose land has been taken is given fair market value, and that certain terms were not defined, were not questions of vagueness. The court rejected the landowners' claims that their due process rights were violated because their property was taken in a proceeding in which they were not a party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The affidavit on which the warrant was issued stated that the officer received a tip that defendant was selling marijuana and cocaine and that trash from his home contained evidence of drug activity. The affidavit requested a no-knock warrant based on the officer's experience that drug dealers would, given time, arm themselves or dispose of evidence. In executing the warrant, the officers knocked on the front door of defendant's home and waited 35 seconds later before using a ram to enter based on concerns about a movement inside and lack of response. The trial court concluded that, while the no-knock provision was erroneously authorized, the officers, after 35 seconds, had reason to believe that evidence was being destroyed. The court on appeal held that, under the &quot;blanket rule,&quot; the no-knock warrant and its execution were proper because defendant was convicted of felonious drug delivery. The court held that, due to the inherent violence associated with drug dealing, the police did not need to offer particularized evidence of weapons to show that exigent circumstances existed for entering without an announcement.</SPAN></P>

The Continuum itself did not affect good time and it did not cause so major a change in the conditions of the inmates' confinement as to implicate a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lodge, ordered by defendant city to raze its dilapidated building, complained of a judgment of the circuit court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The lodge had sought a restraining order and damages on the grounds that the raze order deprived the lodge of reasonable use of its property resulting in a temporary taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court ruled that the building was dilapidated and properly the subject of a raze order and, because the city reasonably exercised its police powers in issuing the raze order, payment of compensation was not required. The order's failure to refer to Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.05 (1991) did not result in a compensable taking of the lodge's property. Although the lodge complained that the order was not issued pursuant to &sect; 66.05, the lodge sought a restraining order under &sect; 66.05 in its action challenging the order. There was no showing that the lodge was deprived of the relief afforded by &sect; 66.05 or that the city proceeded other than under its police powers. It was undisputed that the building was in a dilapidated condition and was clearly worthy of a raze order. The lodge's president agreed in his deposition that the building was unsafe; his testimony permitted an inference that the building was unusable due to its condition, not as a result of the raze order. The lodge's argument that the raze order prohibited all reasonable use of the property was not sufficiently developed. The city did comply with the provisions of &sect; 66.05 in issuing the raze order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Juneau County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a), and of operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b). Defendant, a commercial driver, challenged the admissibility of intoxilyzer test results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for erratic driving, arrested, and given an intoxilyzer test. The arresting officer gave defendant the warnings required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) (1991-92) but did not advise him of the warnings applicable to commercial drivers because defendant was not operating a commercial vehicle nor was he on duty at the time. Defendant appealed and asserted that the intoxilyzer test results were inadmissible because he was not read the portion of the Informing the Accused form relating to commercial drivers as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4m) (1994); he also argued that the jury instructions created an irrebutable presumption of guilt in violation of his due process rights. In affirming, the court held that &sect; 343.305(4m) did not apply because defendant was arrested prior to the statute's effective date. Defendant had been informed of all the rights and penalties relating to him as a regular driver's license holder pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) (1991-92) and therefore the intoxilyzer test results were automatically admissible. The jury was given the option of convicting or acquitting defendant and the instructions did not create an irrebutable presumption.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved for post-conviction relief in the form of a sentence reduction. After his motion was denied, he appealed the judgment of conviction and the order denying his motion. In affirming, the court concluded that the sentence imposed by the trial court was not excessive where the crimes were vicious execution-style slayings in which four people, including three teenage girls who were innocent bystanders, were killed. Further, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the three counts of homicide relating to the three girls even though the physical evidence revealed that the girls were killed from bullets from a gun operated by one of defendant's accomplices.

Several days after the incident, defendant gave a voluntary statement to a police detective. The statement was very vague; defendant said that he did not recall the events.

The prosecutor commented on his alleged inability to recall the evening's events when questioned by the detective and contrasted it with his detailed description at trial. Defendant argued that the comments were constitutionally impermissible. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the bar against use of post-arrest silence to impeach defendant's exculpatory testimony at trial was inapplicable where defendant opened the door to government questioning by his own remarks.The court observed that the prosecutor was not asking the jury to infer guilt from defendant's silence and his inability to recall events when talking to the detective; she was asking them to consider that silence, and that failure to recall, as bearing on defendant's credibility, given his detailed testimony on those events at trial.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV, &sect; 26. The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) granted the motions to dismiss filed by defendants, the state treasurer and the secretaries of the departments of administration and transportation. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department of transportation entered into contracts for various highway improvement projects. Because of a significant increase in fuel prices, five contractors submitted claims to the department to recoup their increased fuel costs after the contracts were performed. The legislature passed bills appropriating funds to pay to the contractors as reimbursement for unanticipated fuel cost increases. The bills were signed into law as 1993 Wis. Laws 431-435. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the payments on the ground that they constituted &quot;extra compensation&quot; in violation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26. The trial court dismissed their action. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the laws were unconstitutional. The court first determined that the presumption of constitutionality applied because the laws concerned matters of substance, not procedure. The payments authorized by the laws were clearly &quot;extra compensation&quot; to the contractors. The court also rejected the trial court's alternative holding that an interdepartmental memorandum incorporated a fuel adjustment clause into the highway contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother asserted that her due process rights were violated because she was inadequately warned of the grounds upon which her parental rights could be terminated. Dispositional orders found her children in need of protection and services, which were extended multiple times. The trial court warned her of the grounds for terminating her parental rights as the law existed before Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2)(c) was amended. The amendment changed the type of conduct for which termination could proceed. Under the old statute, a parent faced termination for culpable conduct or for an inability to meet the conditions established for the children's return to the home. Under the amended statute, a parent faced termination if he or she failed to demonstrate substantial progress toward meeting the conditions established for the children's return. The amendment eliminated the reasons for failure to make substantial progress. The court held that this violated the mother's due process rights because it substantially changed the type of conduct that could lead to the loss of parental rights without notice to the parent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Pierce County (Wisconsin) denying injunctive relief against defendant homeowner, whom the State contended exceeded the legal limit of 50 percent of assessed value for structural repairs to nonconforming floodplain buildings. The trial court found the State had not met its burden of proof and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner's house was located in a floodplain on an island. The house was subject to Wis. Administrative Code &sect; NR 116.15 and Pierce County, Wis., Ordinance ch. 17.60.190 (Sept. 19, 1978), which prohibited structural repairs to a nonconforming structure in excess of 50 percent of the building's assessed value. The State sought an injunction, contending the homeowner had expanded his house beyond the amount allowed in the permit. The court concluded that adding a new porch, enclosing an existing deck, and adding a half-story to a house created a &quot;substantially different&quot; building as contemplated by the Marris decision. Marris created the substantially different test so that repairs that were reasonably necessary to prevent deterioration might not be classed as structural repairs. The actual cost of the additions approximated their estimated cost, because total estimated cost of the project approximated its total actual cost and because no evidence was presented to the contrary. Cost to the homeowner was the only reasonable interpretation of &quot;value&quot; in Wis. Admin. Code &sect; NR 116.15 and Pierce County, Wis., Ordinance ch. 17.60.020. Neither were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of the judgment that held that the applicable code sections were not unconstitutionally vague, reversed the part of the judgment that misapplied the definition of &quot;structural repair,&quot; and remanded the cause for a determination of the precise violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation claimed that excluding corporations from the class of defendants entitled to a preliminary examinations under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.02 violated state and federal equal protection guaranties. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that a corporate defendant had no fundamental right to a preliminary examination under &sect; 971.02 and that there was a rational basis to support the denial of the statutory right to corporations. The court further held that the fundamental right served by the statute was limited to providing a judicial determination of probable cause for incarcerated defendants or those who would be incarcerated but for payment of a bond. The underlying legislative strategy was to operate an efficient court system by allocating court time that could be used for corporate preliminary examinations to areas where there was a more pressing need.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Wisconsin) that denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner had previously pled no contest to various charges, including bail jumping based solely on the consumption of alcohol, and was placed on probation. Two years later his probation was revoked and he was incarcerated. Petitioner claimed that he could not be incarcerated because his bail jumping convictions violated state policy under Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.45(1). That statute provided that alcoholics and intoxicated persons could not be subject to criminal prosecution because of their consumption of alcohol, but should receive treatment instead. The court on appeal reversed and granted petitioner's habeas corpus petition. Petitioner did not waive his right to contest his incarceration by previously pleading no contest because his claim for relief was jurisdictional in nature. Under &sect; 51.45(1) the State could not charge petitioner with bail jumping based solely on his consumption of alcohol. The statute did not prohibit alcohol restrictions as a condition of probation. However, the penalty for a violation could only be a revocation of that status, not a separate criminal charge of bail jumping. Therefore, the bail jumping conviction violated state policy and could not stand.</SPAN></P>
