</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Department of Public Utilities sought review of the decision of the master for the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk (Massachusetts), which granted judgment for appellee gas company in the company's lawsuit alleging that the Department's disallowing a schedule of rates for gas to be sold to the public that the company had filed and permitting the company to file new and lower rates was confiscatory and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department entered an order, disallowing a schedule of rates for gas to be sold to the public which the company had filed and permitting the company to file new and lower rates. The company alleged that the order was confiscatory and unconstitutional. Upon making the claim of confiscation the company became entitled to a determination of that issue by the court. The court determined that there was no error in denying the Department's motion to recommit because many of the reasons for recommittal were in the nature of additional exceptions that could not be filed without a special order of the court. Recommittal should not have been ordered unless it was clear that the evidence before the master made it probable that his findings or failures to find were erroneous. There was no error of law in the master's use of the evidence of book values to find the amount to be deducted from the company's total investment on account of its electric business. However, the master should have required the company to break down the clerical costs for its two businesses. The company could not recover clerical costs for its appliance business by charging higher gas rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court overruled most of the Department's exceptions to the master's report, however the court determined that the master should have required the gas company to segregate the payments for clerical help between its appliance and gas businesses to permit a finding of at least a minimum sum properly chargeable to the gas business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The MTA was authorized by 1945 Mass. Acts 692 (amended 1946) to extend the East Boston tunnel route. Many buildings with dwellings were taken by eminent domain to construct the route. 1949 Mass. Acts 191 (amended 1949), as affected by 1947 Mass. Acts 544, &sect; 8(A)(h), was enacted authorizing the city to expend money raised by taxation to deal with the housing shortage that resulted from the tunnel project. The city took two parcels of land from the landowner by eminent domain. The landowner challenged the constitutionality of 1949 Mass. Acts 191. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional and that the property taking was valid. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the expenditure of money raised by taxation was for a public purpose, specifically the development of housing for 207 individuals and 56 families made homeless by the project. The court noted although property taken by eminent domain could not ordinarily have been paid for by public money raised by taxation for the purpose of reconveying it, the serious problem created by the project permitted the city to make a common sense adjustment in the interest of all of the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The gambler brought an action of contract under the gaming statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 137, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, in which the gambler sought to recover the money lost by him in a bet on a horse race. In its answer, the licensee asserted that it conducted the race under the pari-mutuel system of wagering by virtue of a license from the state racing commission (commission), issued pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 128A. The action was tried to a jury and on motion the judge directed a verdict for the licensee. The gambler contended that the agreed facts and the facts recited in the offer of proof were sufficient to warrant a jury in finding that the commission lacked jurisdiction because of noncompliance with ch. 128A. The gambler also argued that ch. 128A was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the commission complied with the statutory requirements and that any immaterial departures from the literal requirements of the statute did not invalidate the license. The court also concluded that the statute was not an unconstitutional delegation of power by the legislature because the statute amply provided standards for the guidance of the commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff beauty school sought a binding declaration as to the constitutionality of 1949 Mass. Acts ch. 345, an act prohibiting hairdressing schools charging for services or materials used in connection with hairdressing or manicuring.&quot; Defendant Board of Registration of Hairdressers appealed a decision from the superior court (Massachusetts), which found the statute unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the Board from enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The beauty school was engaged in the business of teaching students hairdressing and manicuring. The statute, 1949 Mass. Acts ch. 345, prohibited students from practicing hairdressing or manicuring on any paying customer and prohibited school from charging for services or materials in connection with such practice. The Board contended that the declaratory judgment statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, as inserted by 1945 Mass. Acts ch. 582, &sect; 1, did not cover questions relating to action of boards. The court found the issues raised were appropriate for consideration on a bill for declaratory relief. The trial court found that the prohibition against charging for the cost of materials had no rational tendency to promote the safety, health, morals, or general welfare of the public. On appeal, the court held that both the federal and state constitutions protected every person in the enjoyment of his liberty and property, including the right to engage in any lawful occupation, subject to reasonable regulation. In so far as the statute sought to deprive beauty schools of the right to charge for materials furnished to models, it was unreasonable and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a decision of the superior court (Massachusetts), which convicted him of violating a regulation adopted by the Massachusetts commissioner of airport management and approved by the Massachusetts airport management board under 1948 Mass. Acts 637 for being more than six feet from his taxicab while in line at an airport, imposed a $ 25 fine, and denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a taxicab operator, was convicted of violating an airport regulation. His motion for a directed verdict was denied. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the regulation exceeded the commissioner's authority and was invalid insofar as it imposed a penalty not to exceed $ 500 for any violation. The court ruled that the enabling act was valid and sufficiently defined its mandate in delegating the authority to regulate state-owned airports. The court found that the statute's delegation of power to fix penalties did not render it invalid, but that this authority was not unrestricted and that penalties had to be reasonable. The court ruled that, by imposing a penalty of up to $ 500 for any violation, regardless of its seriousness, the regulation was unreasonable and exceeded legislative penalties for similar offenses, and that the commissioner and board did not exercise reasonable and sound discretion in failing to prescribe punishments to fit the offenses. The court concluded that the fact that defendant was fined only $ 25 was immaterial because the regulation's reasonableness was tested by what could have happened under it rather than by what actually did happen.</SPAN></P>

The reduction of indebtedness incurred in the acquisition of real estate and the construction of buildings. The assessors assessed a property tax against the building, and the Tax Board abated the assessment. The court affirmed and found that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 5 (1932) clearly stated that all property of incorporated agricultural societies was exempt from taxation, no matter how the property was used. The court determined that it was proper to permit the society to lease the building for the benefit, when it was not needed for society purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent created an inter vivos trust while he resided in Massachusetts. He died in Maine where he left a substantial estate. When the federal tax authorities included the trust fund in the decedent's gross estate for purposes of the federal estate tax, the executor filed an action to charge the trustee with a pro rata share of the tax in reliance on Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 142, &sect;&sect; 39-A to 39E, which provided for apportionment of any estate tax paid. Reversing the trial court's decree in favor of the executor, the court ruled that the Maine statute had no extraterritorial effect. The court determined that the trust did not become part of the decedent's estate in Maine or anywhere else, that the only connection between the trust and Maine was that the federal government in imposing an estate tax saw fit to aggregate the probate estate in Maine and the trust fund in Massachusetts into a single &quot;gross estate,&quot; and that this circumstance did not give power to either state to impose by statutory fiat liabilities upon the fiduciary or the property under the exclusive jurisdiction of the other state.</SPAN></P>

The telephone company filed a complaint to annul the department's order disallowing the revised schedules. The department's order was annulled, rendering the entire order ineffective pendente lite. Thereafter, the telephone company began charging the increased rates contained in the revised schedules, and the department sought a writ of mandamus to compel the telephone company to charge the rates in the modified schedules. The court held that the telephone company was properly charging the higher rates contained in the revised schedules and that the single justice properly dismissed the department petition for a writ of mandamus. The annulment of the department's order removed the only bar which had theretofore prevented the rate increase from taking effect, and such rates took effect at once pendente lite.</SPAN></P>

The probation officer filed an application for the son's commitment as a defective delinquent. No notice of this petition was given to the son or his parents. The mother, who appeared at the hearing, sought a continuance on the ground that the counsel she had consulted was unable to appear. The trial court denied the continuance and ordered that the son be committed. The court found that while Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect; 113 (Tercentenary ed. 1932) did not specifically require that notice be given, it impliedly called for notice in accordance with the elements inherent in due process.

In affirming, the court held that putting defendants to trial without the assistance of counsel was not a constitutional violation, as defendants had ample opportunity to procure counsel prior to trial, and the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 12 did not require that counsel be furnished in noncapital cases. All three defendants were mature married men. In no way were they unfairly treated. Thus, defendants were subject to no special prejudice or disadvantage of any kind. The evidence of the commission of the crimes and of the identification of defendants as the perpetrators was so overwhelming that it was impossible to conceive that the result would have been different if they had had counsel. The court concluded by finding that defendants' right to a public trial were not violated; all testimony was taken in their presence, the complete record was available to them for any appropriate purpose, they were tried by a jury, and it did not appear that any person whom any defendant desired to have present was excluded.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and determined that whether the minor was a defective delinquent at the time of the hearing was a question of fact to have been determined by the trial court.

On appeal, the landowner contended that the application of the zoning regulation to its land was an arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive interference with its rights in the property and was violative of the provisions of the constitution of the commonwealth and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The court reversed the decision of the land court and held that the zoning by-law was invalid as applied to the landowner's property. The imposition of residential restrictions upon the landowner's property had no rational relation to the public safety, public health, or public welfare.

Laws ch. 25, &sect; 5, to annul a rate order of defendant Department of Public Utilities (department) on the ground that the order was confiscatory and unlawful. The gas company contended that the order prevented the gas company from receiving a reasonable return on the fair value of its property and deprived the gas company of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The gas company provided gas to a city and its immediate vicinity. The gas company filed with the Department of Public Utilities (department) a schedule of increased rates, which was disallowed. The gas company then filed a new schedule but also filed a bill of complaint asserting that the order denying the first rate schedule was confiscatory and unlawful in that it prevented the gas company from receiving a reasonable return on the fair value of the property and had the effect of depriving the gas company of property without due process of law, contrary to the U.S. Const. amend XIV, arts. 10, 12. Upon review, the court agreed with the gas company and held that the department's order was confiscatory. The court stated that an owner, who alleged that confiscation of his property would result from a rate order of the department, was guaranteed a fair opportunity for submitting that issue to a court for determination upon its own independent judgment as to both law and facts and that Mass. Gen. Law. ch. 25, &sect; 5, afforded the gas company that right. The court found that department's order was barren of findings that revealed the principles underlying the department's conclusions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the interlocutory decrees in favor of the gas company and annulled the order of the Department of Public Utilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reviewed proposed amendments to civil service rules regarding the preferential treatment of veterans in promotions and answered questions posed by the Governor and Council. The first amendment added points to the general average mark obtained by any veteran in competitive examinations for promotion, provided that the veteran first obtained a passing mark, while the second amendment added a year of service to the length of service for veterans. The court concluded that the proposed amendments were not unconstitutional because the new civil service rules would not only have required veterans to pass examinations but would have given them no absolute preference if they did pass. In granting veterans an extra year of service, the veterans were still required to possess the required qualifications. The proposed amendments were within the authority of the civil service commission to make, and the Governor and Council had the power to approve them under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 3. However, the Governor and Council had no power to substitute an amendment of their own. The court refused to answer abstract questions that were not necessary to any immediately existing occasion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicant was a veteran who wanted to prevent the director from establishing a list of eligible employees for promotion to a police sergeant position before the commission set forth a rule that established a preference in promotion to veterans. The applicant had filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to comply with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 3, cl. 1(g), which provided a preference to veterans in promotion. The director's demurrer averred generally that the applicant was entitled to no relief in equity against the director. The trial court sustained the director's demurrer and dismissed the applicant's bill in equity. The applicant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the applicant was entitled to no relief against the director because his grievance related to the failure of the commission, over whom the director had no control, to establish a rule as contemplated by the statute. Unless the director proposed to act under a void or unconstitutional statute, which was not alleged, equity would not interfere to enjoin the director from carrying out his duties even though the applicant might be irreparably damaged as a result.</SPAN></P>

The stockholders filed a motion for the appointment of a receiver. The holding company and an intervenor railroad objected, claiming that the 1946 Act impaired a contract created by Mass. Gen.

The court held that the 1909 Act and 1910 Act did not create a contract and that the Acts were subject to the powers of amendment and repeal contained in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 437, &sect; 2 (1903). The court also held that the five percent restriction contained in the 1946 Act constituted a rational provision adapted to secure the public welfare, did not reach beyond permissible regulation under the general powers of the Legislature, and was not a taking of property without compensation or due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The decedent's will contained the A and B trusts and a third trust that mainly were for the establishment, maintenance, and upkeep of a public park and museum on the conveyed land. Petitioners' action sought modification of the three trusts. The principal departure from the decedent's terms was involved in superseding the discretion of the B trustees as to 70 percent of the net income of the B trust and requiring them to pay it to the town. The interlocutory decree of the master denied the B trustees' motion to recommit, overruled their exceptions to the master's report, and confirmed the report. The B trustees sought review. On further review, the court affirmed the interlocutory decree and denied the B trustees' demurrer.

Thus, defendant was not obligated to provide compensation. The exception from the scope of the Workmen's Compensation Act granted to defendant and its employees was eliminated by an amendment, which became operative after plaintiff's accident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant appealed an Industrial Accident Reviewing Board (board) decision that summarily affirmed an administrative judge's decision denying his claim for workers' compensation benefits for medical expenses and periods of total and partial disability, alleging exposure to carbon monoxide fumes and chemical solvents that caused him to develop toxic encephalopathy. The court vacated the board's decision and remanded to the Department of Industrial Accidents, holding that the administrative judge's rejection of an impartial medical examiner's report, coupled with the judge's refusal of both parties' motions to submit additional medical evidence, resulted in no medical evidence whatsoever being before the administrative judge. The administrative judge's reliance upon his own knowledge of medical matters was error because the nature and cause of toxic encephalopathy was a medically complex matter that warranted the admission of additional medical evidence pursuant to Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs appealed a decision of the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which denied their Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the summary judgment that dismissed their original wrongful termination complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs sued defendant for wrongful termination, basing their claim in part on Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &sect; 4(1A). The trial court entered summary judgment for defendant. The appellate court construed &sect; 4(1A) as violative of the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, and affirmed the trial court's judgment. When &sect; 4(1A) was subsequently amended to correct its scope, plaintiffs, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), moved the trial court for relief from the summary judgment that dismissed their complaint. Plaintiffs then sought review of the denial of their motion. The court reviewed &sect; 4(1A) as modified, and determined that it was indeed intended to apply retroactively. Finding that plaintiffs could have benefited from the new construction of the statute, the court held that they were entitled to emergency relief. It therefore reversed the trial court's decision that denied plaintiffs' motion, insofar as that decision was based on analysis of the &sect; 4(1A) claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Noting that the statute upon which plaintiffs had relied had been modified since the lower appellate court had construed it as violating the establishment clause of the First Amendment, the court held that the modifications were retroactive. It thus reversed and remanded so much of the trial court's decision that denied plaintiffs emergency relief from the resolution of their statutory wrongful termination claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed his conviction of stalking in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 43. At a jury trial, defendant timely moved for a required finding of not guilty. On appeal, defendant argued that he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty because the commonwealth proved two, not three, incidents of following as required to sustain a conviction for stalking. The court affirmed, after considering the facts, which showed that defendant had threatened and assaulted his wife, followed her on various occasions, and otherwise harassed her in violation of a restraining order. Although the challenged jury instruction was erroneous on its face, the error neither created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice nor was it sufficiently significant in the trial's context to make plausible an inference that the result might have been otherwise but for the error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed; defendant was not entitled to a finding that he was not guilty of stalking because changing the jury instruction that he challenged, although erroneous on its face, would not plausibly have altered the trial's outcome and, therefore, did not create a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed her conviction of assault and battery on her child, that caused substantial bodily injury, under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 13J. The court affirmed the conviction. The child was left in defendant's custody and suffered injuries inconsistent with defendant's explanation. The commonwealth's theory was shaken baby syndrome. Defendant denied shaking the baby in a written statement taken by a state trooper. On appeal defendant contended that the scienter requirement of &sect; 13J violated her due process rights because it did not require scienter and challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The court rejected defendant's contentions. Section 13J prescribed the penalty for assault and battery but was silent on the definition of the crime. Because the judge instructed the jury on the alternative theory of assault and battery, there was no reversible error. Although expert medical testimony was conflicting, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences most favorable to the commonwealth, it sustained its burden of proof. The possibility of raising conflicting inferences from the evidence did not preclude the fact finder from determining the truth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to one drug offense and the lower court judge imposed a sentence to commence &quot;from and after&quot; the sentence previously imposed for one of the crimes for which he was on release. The judge imposed the sentence pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 8B, as appearing in St. 1994, c. 68, &sect; 8. On appeal from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the defendant contested the judge's determination that a consecutive sentence was mandated. In affirming the lower court's judgment, the court on appeal analyzed Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 58, as appearing in St. 1995, ch. 39, &sect; 13. The court concluded that even if defendant had been released under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 276, &sect; 57, defendant was still subject to the provisions of &sect; 58. The court rejected defendant's interpretation of the statutes as it would result in persons released on personal recognizance being subject to a mandatory consecutive sentence if they committed crimes while on release while persons on cash surety bail could be given a concurrent sentence under similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea was affirmed because the interpretation of the statutory provisions as espoused by defendant was viewed as unreasonable and perhaps unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The girl's mother called the police. Defendant pulled over and obscured his license plate. Police pursued defendant, who was speeding and weaving in and out of traffic, ran a stop sign, and drove over a traffic island curb. A police officer saw defendant's clothes disheveled and his pants partially unzipped. The superior court found defendant guilty of open and gross lewdness, driving to endanger, concealing the identity of a motor vehicle registration plate, and failure to stop on the signal of a police officer. He appealed. The court affirmed. The girl's testimony, corroborated by other evidence, supported the inference that she had seen defendant's genitalia. The witnesses' failure to identify the object as defendant's penis did not render the inference unreasonable in light of the entire testimony. The evidence was sufficient to warrant the charges. Counsel's assistance was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to dismiss the indictment, as defendant's conduct fell squarely within the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff inmate appealed the grant of summary judgment to defendants by the Middlesex Superior Court (Massachusetts), in his action challenging the constitutionality of the Department of Correction policy requiring an admission of guilt to sex offenses as a condition to attaining a lower security classification. For the same allegedly unconstitutional conduct, plaintiff sought damages for violation of his civil rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a prison inmate, challenged as unconstitutional a policy requiring an admission of guilt to the crimes for which he was sentenced as a condition to attaining a lower security classification. In addition, he objected to a requirement that a participant sign a sex offender's treatment waiver agreement that contained an admission that he was a sex offender. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants. The court did not view the requirement that defendant admit that he was a sex offender as a penalty which implicated either the federal or state privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that a prisoner's expectation of residency in a particular prison was too insubstantial to trigger due process protections. It concluded that the sex offender treatment policy satisfied the rational basis test because no suspect classification was involved and because the policy of denying lower security placement to those who refused to participate in the program served legitimate state interests in rehabilitating offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed where the court held that a requirement of admission to a sex offense as a condition to attaining a lower security classification did not implicate federal or state privileges against self-incrimination, and that the sex offender treatment policy satisfied the rational basis test because no suspect classification was involved and the program served legitimate state interests in rehabilitating offenders.</SPAN></P>

Declaration of Rights art. 16. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's issuance of the injunction, finding that the university reacted to the content of the message, that the room use fee in the absence of a content-neutral policy created an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas, and that access to the public forum was improperly denied. The court further found that the university violated applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11H, 11I, because stationing uniformed guards outside the closed building constituted interference with free speech rights by &quot;threats, intimidation or coercion.&quot; The violation of rights did not have to be overtly harmful or frightening, nor was proof of the university's intent necessary to the cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgments. The mobile home park owners could have made no claim that the manner in which their rents were regulated amounted to a physical invasion or confiscation of their property, nor did it deny them all economically beneficial or productive use of their property. The trial court did not err in finding that the mobile home park owners were in no more than a technical breach of &sect; 32L(8). Given that holding and the holding that the mobile home park owners were not in breach of Mass.  Gen.

Laws ch. 258, &sect; 10(h) specifically barred claims based on the failure to provide adequate police protection. The court rejected the victim's contention that the act of the court, in issuing a protective order, constituted an assurance of safety. The court held that the evidence precluded a finding that the town gave explicit and specific assurances of safety to the victim or her family. The court held that to the contrary, the town assured the victim and her family it could not have taken any action until it saw the attacker violating the protective order. The court held that nothing in the evidence suggested that the town restricted the victim's liberty so as to give rise to an affirmative duty to protect the victim. The court rejected any equal protection claim, holding that the victim failed to show systematically different treatment by the town between domestic abuse cases and non-domestic abuse cases.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 268, &sect; 16 and for being a habitual criminal under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 25. Pursuant to ch. 279, &sect; 25, he was sentenced to 10 years, the maximum term provided by law. He raised four issues on appeal, including that the sentence violated his right to equal protection under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While on a prison furlough granted under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 90A, defendant got drunk and failed to return. On appeal, he argued that records of his incarceration admitted at trial should have excluded references to a later sentence, unrelated charges, and his parole status. The court held that his prior convictions were admitted not for impeachment purposes but to prove that he had committed an essential element of the offense. There was no risk that the jury impermissibly convicted defendant of being a habitual criminal on the basis of the entries. As to his equal protection claim based on the disparate statutory sentencing provisions of ch. 268, &sect; 16 and ch. 127, &sect; 90A, the court held that, because a furlough privilege was more expansive than a work release privilege granted under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 86F, the greater penalty for violation of the former satisfied the rational relationship test. An appeal of a denial of postconviction relief did not preclude the use of the conviction for purposes of ch. 279, &sect; 25. A jury instruction concerning the intent required for an escape conviction and the denial of an intoxication instruction were proper. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the escape and habitual criminal convictions in the superior court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The teachers had requested that the commissioner start arbitration proceedings pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, &sect; 42, as amended by 1993 Mass. Stat. ch. 71, &sect; 44, concerning their layoffs by the school superintendent. The committee filed the instant action against the teachers and the commissioner seeking a declaration that the teachers were not entitled to the requested arbitration hearing under the Act because they had already proceeded with arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement, which had been executed prior to the enactment of the Act. That arbitration hearing had been held, and the arbitrator had ruled in favor of the committee. The trial court had thus granted a temporary restraining order to stop the commissioner from proceeding with arbitration under the Act. By joint motion of the parties, the case was reported to the court for determination under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 111, Mass. R. Civ. P. 64. In response to the report, the court ruled that the arbitration procedures in the Act only applied to performance-based layoffs, and the teachers were laid off for budgetary reasons caused by declining enrollment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion of the health care providers to dismiss the action as barred by the repose provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 60D (amended 1986). The minor appealed, asserting that as she was under two years of age when the injury occurred, she had until the age of nine to begin her action, and that a contrary interpretation violated state and federal constitutional guarantees. The court affirmed, holding that the 1986 amendment was a statute of repose that barred the action. The legislature amended the applicable statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims by adding a statute of repose barring the bringing of an action more than seven years after the act or omission which gave rise to the cause of action. This interpretation was consistent with the legislative purpose in adding a statute of repose to reduce the cost of malpractice insurance for health care professionals.

The order required defendant to surrender any weapons in his possession and allowed police to search the residence. Defendant was convicted for trafficking in cocaine. The court affirmed the conviction and found that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress the cocaine because defendant's wife consented to the search when she obtained the abuse prevention order. Furthermore there was ample evidence that defendant's wife knew the officers would go to her house and that she voluntarily consented to their entry. Once inside the house, the officers lawfully seized the cocaine pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. The court also found that evidence of the nine guns seized from defendant was not improper bad act evidence because there was no indication that defendant possessed the weapons illegally. The court found that the prosecutor's insinuation in his closing argument that two men present at defendant's residence when police served the order were there to do a drug deal was not improper because it was based on evidence admitted at trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed the motion, and defendants did not object. The seating arrangements provided defendants no more than a profile view of each child's face while the child testified. While defendants' cases were on appeal to the court, the state supreme court decided another case dealing with seating arrangements and the right to confrontation and determined that seating arrangements could result in a violation of article 12. Defendants then filed the motions at issue. On appeal, the court held that the special seating arrangements in this case violated defendants' right of confrontation as guaranteed by article 12; however, defendants waived the issue because there was no objection to the seating arrangements at trial and the law at the time of trial and at the time of the direct appeal was sufficient to notify defendants of the existence of the confrontation issue.

On appeal, she argued that evidence should have been suppressed, because a wiretap order depended on telephone records information that the police, purporting to act under Mass. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Some of the demands for the telephone records were signed by a district attorney, as required by &sect; 17B, but others were signed by a police officer. On appeal, the court held that the latter demands were impermissible under &sect; 17B. However, no material information about defendant was obtained as a result of those demands, so any error was harmless. The court further held that &sect; 17B was not impliedly repealed by the revisions to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99 in 1968 Mass. Acts 738, &sect; 1. The court held that &sect; 17B was not unconstitutional. Her reasonable expectation of privacy in the telephone records, which were shared, at least between the long distance carrier and the local carrier, was necessarily attenuated and was commonly penetrated by civil subpoena. Concerning her claim that the jury instructions on constructive possession of cocaine were erroneous and damaging, the court noted that counsel had not objected at trial. Therefore, the issue could not be assigned as error on appeal. In any event, her claim had no merit substantively. The accurate instructions could not have led to any claimed jury confusion. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Because the Florida charges were dismissed, they were deemed to be a nullity. Allowing the credit did not create the problem of double credit, and it recognized the desired goal of eliminating dead jail time, even when it occurred in a foreign jurisdiction, so long as the confinement in the foreign jurisdiction was attributable to Massachusetts charges on which defendant was later convicted and incarcerated.</SPAN></P>

The mother claimed on appeal that her counsel was ineffective because he did not assert that the placement of the child in a non-Christian pre-adoptive home violated the mother's rights under Mass Gen. Laws ch. 210, &sect; 5B, Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 2, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C.S.&sect;&sect; 2000bb-1-2000bb-4. The court rejected the mother's claims. The court found that the mother's consent was not necessary because the mother had not surrendered the child for adoption as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 210, &sect; 5B. The court also found that there was no merit to the mother's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel's failure to raise the issues did not fall measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer and was not likely deprive the mother of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 234A, &sect; 4, which allowed persons over age 70 to excuse themselves from jury service, was unconstitutional because the exemption deprived him of a fair pool of potential jurors. He further contended that his violation of a judicial injunction prohibiting him from obstructing access to any facility that provided abortion counseling or services was excused because he acted on his religious beliefs and in defense of unborn children. On appeal, the court affirmed because the statute was constitutional and because defendant's religious beliefs did not excuse criminal acts and precedent foreclosed his necessity defense. The statutory exemption from jury service for persons over the age of 70 was constitutional because defendant failed to establish a violation of the fair cross section requirement. To prove that, he had to show that the group allegedly discriminated against by not being included in the jury pool constituted a distinctive group, but he provided no evidence that persons over the age of 70, as a group, shared the necessary commonality of attitude, values, ideas, or interests that would have delineated them as a distinctive group.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that those accouterments were insufficient as a matter of law to satisfy the statute's &quot;masked&quot; element. The court concluded that defendant was not masked or disguised within the meaning of ch. 265, &sect; 17, and, therefore, that question should not have been put to the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court upheld the commissioner's blanket denial of earned good time credit for participation in rehabilitative programs. The prisoners claimed that prisoners serving consecutive sentences for crimes committed while on parole, crimes not eligible for statutory good time, and crimes subject to a mandatory minimum sentence, and those serving time in a different penal facility were mistakenly excluded from receiving earned good time credits. They argued that the blanket denial was an abuse of discretion. The court reversed the judgment insofar as it failed to order retroactive relief for all prisoners who had been erroneously denied earned good time credit during the Piggott time and were serving a consecutive sentence under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 8A in a Massachusetts facility for crimes committed before they were jailed on the Piggott time sentence. The court based its holding on two principles: (1) prisoners should not be required to serve &quot;dead time,&quot; and (2) prisoners had no right to bank time served against future offenses. The court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 129D gave the commissioner discretion whether or not to award credits for rehabilitative programs.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and the district court found him guilty of one violation of the no contact order by contacting the victim by telephone. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that defendant improperly appealed his conviction and waived his right to raise a due process challenge. The court found that defendant's due process challenge to the district judge's initial no contact order was unrelated to his conviction for unlawfully contacting the victim and thus, there was no issue for appeal. The court determined that while defendant claimed to have obtained relief from the no contact order by virtue of a pending paternity action in a probate court, defendant did not offer any evidence to support such assertion. The court concluded that defendant did not preserve his right to challenge the constitutionality of the no contact order because he did not raise such by a dispositive motion in the proceedings below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A restraining order was obtained against defendant, which prohibited him from contacting the victim in any way, either directly or through someone else.

The jury returned a guilty verdict, on which judgment was entered by the trial court against defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that due process required clarity of expression with the purpose of giving a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what the restraining order prohibited, so that he might act accordingly, and with the further purpose of enabling a putative enforcer of the order to apply it without discrimination. The court found that the word &quot;contact&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and that its meaning was plain, and that defendant's acts were within the prohibited conduct of the order because he acted otherwise than in person, through someone else rather than directly, and achieved a communication with the victim amounting to contact.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed because the trial court erred when it allowed evidence of her failure to take a breathalyzer test. Even though she was the first to mention the test, and case law at the time of her trial required a jury instruction on the officer's obligation to offer the breathalyzer test, the Commonwealth was not permitted in inquire further and ask whether she had refused to take the test because she had not waived her right to have such evidence excluded. Her privilege against self-incrimination and Mass. Gen. Laws &sect; 24(1)(e) was violated when the prosecutor stated that her refusal to take the test was motivated by consciousness of guilt. Although the court found that two questions by the prosecutor did not violate her Miranda rights, the prosecutor's closing arguments about her lack of cooperation exceeded the bounds of proper argument because they called her silence into question.</SPAN></P>

Secondly, the court held that the charge was not a tax because the charge was not compulsory, but rather it was a matter of choice.

The court observed that negligently handling a firearm while drunk and aggressive verbal abuse toward police officers was improper, disorderly, and intemperate, embarrassing to the police, and not becoming a police officer, and that the evidence warranted the discharge. The court noted that, while the offense occurred in the ex-officer's home, off-duty, and he had no other disciplinary incidents, those were factors that the Commission had discretion to consider, but they did not compel a lesser sanction than the one chosen.

The trial court also granted one of the cities judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to damages. The court affirmed the declaratory judgment and reversed the damages award as to the other city. The court held that the real estate developer's request would encroach on the jurisdiction of one city by permitting the residual capacity of sewage lines owned and maintained by it to be reduced not by development within its borders, but by connections located in and authorized by the other city.

Defendant's motion for postconviction relief was denied, and he appealed, arguing that the jury instructions on joint venture unconstitutionally shifted to defendant the burden of persuading the jury that he was not a joint venturer. The court ruled that the instructions could not reasonably be read as placing the burden of proof upon defendant. Further, the court held that the charge as a whole sufficiently apprised the jury of the state's burden of proof on joint venture so as not to create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the judgment, concluding that the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal he claimed that the statute was vague and overbroad and that the trial court erred in not giving his requested instructions, including an instruction on unanimity. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that if defendant decided that specific unanimity was consistent with the theory of defense and took the required steps to request an instruction, defendant was entitled to receive it.Accordingly, the instruction should have been given. The court ruled, however, that reversal was not required because the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury unanimously determined that at least two incidents occurred. Because the victim's testimony about them was uniform, no rational juror could have concluded that one incident was a crime but the others were not. Further, the quantity and quality of the evidence was sufficient for conviction based on the victim's general description of all the incidents. Following the trial court's instructions, the jury must have found unanimously that at least one incident occurred, and that was all that was required to convict.</SPAN></P>

The applicants filed a mandamus action seeking reversal of the board's action, but the trial court entered judgment in favor of the board and the daughter. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the board was not required to grant the license to the first qualified applicant, but rather acted within the scope of its discretion to determine that the daughter was the applicant best qualified to run a shellfish operation; the daughter was not constructively the alter-ego of her parents, and thus was not barred from obtaining the license despite the fact that her parents were the previous license-holders; and accordingly, the trial court's judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court found that defendant's prearrest statements were admissible because the officer was not required to give Miranda warnings to defendant when defendant spoke first and when the officer asked preliminary questions. The postarrest statements were also admissible because Miranda warnings were given and the statements were voluntarily made under the totality of the circumstances. The court held that the breathalyzer results were properly admitted because there was testimony that the breathalyzer was maintained, tested, and kept in accordance with Mass Regs. Code tit. 501, &sect; 2.41 (1987).

The trustees cross-appealed the denial by summary judgment of class-action certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The town adopted a sewer-connection-permit program that essentially increased the sewer-connection charge to be paid by those that sought to connect to the public sewer system or to increase usage of an existing connection. The trustees challenged the program in the trial court arguing that it was a tax. The trial court granted summary judgment on the issue to the trustees ruling that the program imposed a tax and not a fee. The town appealed to the court. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. A three-factor test determined whether or not a fee imposed by a town was a valid use of police power or an unconstitutional tax on real property. To be a fee, a charge had to be for an essentially private benefit instead of a public benefit. The court agreed with the trial court that the benefits of the program were not intended to be particularized to the new connectors charged with its cost. While removal of sewage flows via the charge would theoretically benefit new users by freeing up capacity and allowing them to connect to the sewer system, it would provide as much or greater benefit to existing users whose property was periodically covered with raw sewage after heavy rain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff municipal light companies sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which dismissed their complaint against defendant commonwealth for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The companies sought to recover damages incurred from actions taken by the commonwealth, which delayed the operation of a certain nuclear power plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The companies argued that: (1) the commonwealth was liable for damages on theories of estoppel or implied contract; (2) the commonwealth made a de facto taking of property without just compensation; and (3) the commonwealth unconstitutionally impaired contractual obligations. On review, the court found that the commonwealth, acting through its highest officials consistently opposed licensure of the plant on the public policy grounds that operation posed a significant health and safety risk to the public; therefore the principles of estoppel were not applicable against the commonwealth. Further, the court found no taking by the commonwealth because less convenient access was not a ground for compensation, and the companies had not been totally deprived of the value of their property. Finally, the court found rejected the companies' impairment of contract claim because the companies failed to point to any act of the legislature that impaired their contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The superior court concluded that the division had not given the tavern adequate notice of a 1987 license revocation hearings, and that the division could not conduct a hearing to determine whether to approve the tavern's presentation of nude entertainment. The division's appeal was dismissed, and the denial of attorney's fees to the tavern was affirmed. The court found that the passage of time had rendered moot the issuance of entertainment licenses for 1987 through 1990. Because of mootness the court did not decide issues concerning the division's findings, following the 1987 license revocation hearings, that the tavern violated the licensing regarding nude entertainment. Further, the court found that there was no error in the denial of the tavern's application for attorney's fees and costs. The tavern was not the prevailing party under &sect; 1988 because it could not point to a resolution of the dispute, which changed the legal relationship between itself and the division.</SPAN></P>

Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, which the lower court granted to the town. The lower court found that &sect; 123-14 forbade the issuance of building permits for more than 10 dwelling units exclusive of unused authorizations, and that the term &quot;unused authorizations&quot; meant permits that had been actually applied for and issued but not used. On appeal, the court affirmed the finding. The lower court held that the lower court's interpretation of &sect; 123-14 was correct because it gave proper deference to the reasonable construction that the planning board had given as charged with its implementation and was consistent with ordinary principles of statutory construction. The court also found that the interpretation was supported by a contextual reading of the entire sentence and the general policy considerations underlying both zoning and subdivision regulation.</SPAN></P>

The collective bargaining agreement, by imposing a &quot;just cause&quot; standard for the discharge of probationary employees, directly and substantially conflicted with the provisions of &sect; 34, which called for an experimental testing of fitness during a trial period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted under &sect; 39(b) of threatening economic injury when he allegedly advised a lender that his loan would not go through unless a payment of an additional two points was made. Defendant appealed his conviction alleging, inter alia, that &sect; 39(b) was void for vagueness. The court affirmed the conviction holding that the statute, as applied to defendant's conduct, was not impermissibly vague and that defendant's actions fell well within the core of the type of conduct prohibited by the statute. The court determined that the statute gave fair warning that it was a crime to coerce someone to give up something of value in order to avoid the infliction of an economic injury or the loss of an economic opportunity. The court found that defendant, fully aware that the lender had tax problems and that he was anxious to secure the loan, told the lender that the loan would not be approved unless he paid the additional points to someone outside of the bank for a reason unrelated to the lending process. The court also found that neither defendant nor the paid party was a principal in the loan transaction, and neither had an interest or say in the loan and its terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was found guilty of the rape of a child for sexually abusing his daughter's friend when she would visit defendant's family home and spent the night with his daughter. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because he failed to file certain motions, argue the statute of limitations, and make certain objections at trial. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that defendant failed to provide evidence of what counsel was actually thinking or planning and therefore, the court could not find his actions amounted to serious incompetency. The court found that even if it concluded that counsel's work was deficient, it could not conclude that better work would have made a material difference. There was no harm in counsel's failure to file a motion for a required finding of not guilty because the jury could have found that at least one incident of forcible rape occurred within the limitations period, and no remarks to which counsel failed to object caused substantial prejudice to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Laws ch. 183B, &sect;&sect; 38, 41, 53 were explicitly pegged to the date of the signing of the original time-share contract, which occurred 11 months prior to the act's effectiveness; and (3) that Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 183B, &sect; 4, which pertained to waivers, was not one of the sections given even limited retroactive effect by Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 183B, &sect; 3, thus, Mass. Ann.

The court reversed in part, holding that subjecting defendants to the good faith performance requirement of Mass. Ann.

During a roadside search of the car pursuant to department policy, the officer opened a closed paper bag and found a smoking pipe with marihuana residue. Defendant appealed his conviction for unlawful possession of marihuana in violation of &sect; 34. The court reversed, set aside the verdict, and entered judgment for defendant because the trial court improperly denied defendant's motion to suppress the pipe seized during an unconstitutional warrantless search of the contents of the bag. The court held that the search was not permissible to remove weapons or protect the officers because the passenger had been secured and defendant had been arrested, handcuffed, and placed in the cruiser. The court found that the search exceeded the officer's authority under Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An employee suffered severe burns as a result of a chemical explosion. The wife and children brought an action against the employer for the loss of consortium and parental guidance and affection that they had sustained. The superior court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment. The wife and children appealed, arguing that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &sect; 24, which abolished the common law rights of spouses and children of an injured employee unless the employee preserved his own common law rights, was unconstitutional under both the federal and the state constitution. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the statute did not violate due process and equal protection. The court noted that every rational presumption was indulged in favor of the validity of an act. Enforcement of such legislative enactment would not be refused unless its conflict with some provision of the Massachusetts Constitution was established beyond reasonable doubt. Also, the legislature could enact a statute that abolished a common law cause of action without providing a substitute remedy when the statute was rationally related to a permissible legislative objective.</SPAN></P>

The orders required the father to pay support, higher education costs, and counsel fees under the Mass. Child Support Guidelines (1989) (guidelines) and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the father, a man married to another woman, was found to be the father of the mother's son, he was ordered to pay weekly child support. Three years later, the mother filed a complaint seeking an upward modification. The district court increased the support order, awarded counsel fees to the mother, and ordered the father, if his son desired education beyond high school, to pay for the costs. The father appealed and contended that the needs of his preexisting family were not sufficiently taken into account and that the order to pay counsel fees and higher education costs was improper. The court affirmed in part, finding that the district court correctly took into account the father's other children and that the support order was not discriminatory or unfair. The court held that to deny an award of counsel fees to the mother of an out-of-wedlock child would be unconstitutional because fees were authorized in cases where the child was born to parents joined in marriage. The court vacated the order to pay higher education costs as &quot;vague&quot; and held that the guidelines required the district court to look to current and not to future situations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A police officer stopped defendant's truck. The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol from the truck cab. He observed several bottles of alcohol on the front seat, two of which were partially empty. Defendant failed several field sobriety tests and became belligerent and uncooperative. The officer called for assistance and defendant was arrested. At trial, the second officer testified as to the obscene language that defendant used towards the first officer. Defendant was found guilty. During sentencing, the district judge remarked that he would not have imposed the term of imprisonment but for the obscene language used by defendant. On appeal, defendant asserted that the district judge improperly imposed the sentence based on what she said rather than her conduct, which violated her rights under the First Amendment. The court held that defendant's use of obscene language was indicative of her state of intoxication. The sentence imposed was within the range allowed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24. The sentence was proper because the finder of fact could have reasonably concluded that defendant used extreme obscenities because she was very intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

After witnessing two traffic violations the officers decided to stop defendant's vehicle, which refused to pull over. The officers observed items being tossed from the car. When the car was stopped cocaine was found. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the decision to stop defendant's car was justified because the officers had observed two traffic violations and once stopped they had the right to frisk an occupant because they had observed the occupant getting into the car with a gun and defendant was known to possess firearms in the past. Thus, the officers acted reasonably in removing a bulging object from a pouch in the car thinking it could be a gun, when in fact it was cocaine. The court found that defendant had voluntarily given up all control over the items tossed from the car and had no expectation of privacy to them. The court found that impeachment of defendant's credibility by use of his prior conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute was not so prejudicial or lacking in probative value, that it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's conviction on the gaming indictment was alleged and proved to be his second infraction within a five-year period. As a result, Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 271, &sect; 10, the provision for second or subsequent offenders, applied and required that upon a second offense the defendant receive both a prison term and a fine. The trial judge sentenced defendant under &sect; 10 to three months in a house of correction and imposed a fine of $ 1,000. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 10 was unconstitutionally vague and his motion to suppress evidence should have been granted by the trial court. The court found that the search warrant was properly executed by the police as they were not constitutionally required to knock and announce before they entered defendant's residence with a search warrant. Therefore, defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied. As to &sect; 10, the court found that there was no fatal ambiguity in the sentencing scheme, only a harsher result for a second-time offender. The statutory scheme under &sect;&sect; 10 and 17 clearly provided notice as to the potential penalties for violation of each section.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of her convictions, the court held that the prosecution did not give an improper closing argument despite defendant's claim that the prosecutor unfairly characterized the theory of her defense and the offering of alternative causes for the crime. The court found there was no miscarriage of justice by the prosecution's degrading of defendant's expert witness, the prosecution's comment about an incident when defendant's husband burst in on defendant and another man, and the prosecution's remarks about defendant's promises in exchange for the bludgeoning of her husband.

The court affirmed and held that the ordinance was to prohibit uniformly the outdoor storage of automobiles, without regard to particular reasons an owner of cars might have for keeping them around. As to the underlying objective of the ordinance, preventing persons from keeping derelict cars, it was consistent with the power of municipalities under Mass. Gen.

The park contained roadways, but they had not been accepted as public ways. The motorcyclist and advocacy group challenged the regulation and the trial court found for the park commission. The court affirmed. The court held that the regulation did not conflict with state law because the legislature had delegated authority to the park commission to adopt such regulations. The regulation was constitutional because it was rationally related to the government's purpose of maintaining quiet and orderly parks and it did not infringe on a protected right. The regulation did not prevent anyone from traveling within the park, nor did it stop anyone from speaking, assembling, or associating with other persons in the park. Plaintiffs failed to establish that the regulation was invalid. The regulation's classification of motorcycles into one group and other motor vehicles into a second class was also rationally related to the city's interests as the prohibition of motorcycles was to enhance public peace and safety.</SPAN></P>

The district court affirmed this decision in a de novo hearing and ordered the dogs' removal &quot;forthwith.&quot; Defendant was subsequently found guilty of refusing to comply with the order. Defendant sought review and the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 157 was unconstitutional. The court accepted that the statute was penal in nature and, therefore, was required to define the proscribed activity with sufficient definiteness. However, the court said, the statute was not vague if it required persons to conform their conduct to an imprecise, but comprehensible, normative standard. In this case, the court said, the statutory language that a dog could be declared a nuisance by reason of &quot;excessive barking&quot; gave the board more than sufficient guidance by which to carry out the terms of &sect; 157. The court further found that the statute afforded defendant adequate due process and that his due process rights were not offended by the manner in which the charges were handled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Massachusetts legislature enacted &sect; 277C, which required the label, &quot;not an original&quot; be affixed to paintings that were not original.

The trial court dismissed the action for lack of standing. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, noting that the art dealer did not establish that he sold paintings that were not original or that any enforcement action was pending against the art dealer. The court held that the trial court did not err when it found that the declaratory judgment action improperly was brought in order to elicit an answer to the abstract question of the statute's constitutionality. Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, &sect;&sect; 1,2, an actual controversy and legal standing were required in order to bring the declaratory judgment action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the complaint for undue delay in the service of a citation upon him and erred in excluding from evidence a videotape offered by the defense that purported to reenact the event. Defendant was sent a citation for the offense five days after the victim died. Defendant stated that the case was one of &quot;sloth or sheer inattention&quot; on the part of the officer in furnishing the homicide citation and that the complaint should have been dismissed by reason of the delay without regard to whether the defense was prejudiced thereby. There was nothing in the contention that defendant was deprived of fair notice or opportunity to be heard and present a defense. Despite what may well have been earnest efforts by the defense to reproduce faithfully the historical event, the videotape appeared intrinsically to take sides. The judge could reason that to admit a videotape in that condition of affairs would have invited diversionary evidence on both sides about how faithful the representation was, but as a spectacle, the videotape could have made a strong impression on a jury, who might have ignored its deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commonwealth appealed a decision of the Malden Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts), which allowed a motion to dismiss filed by defendant on the basis of a conflict between Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 49, &sect;&sect; 62, 95. Defendant was found guilty by a jury of violating &sect; 62 after he hired a 17-year-old high school student to work for him by putting the student behind the wheel of defendant's company van.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 62 proscribed the employment of a minor under 18 from operating motor vehicles of any description. Section 95 required that express or transportation companies that hired minors over 16 and under 18 had to keep on file an educational certificate showing the minor's age and whether the minor met the certain educational requirements. Defendant had a pick up and delivery service. He hired the student. Defendant obtained the required educational certificate, however, the student was only 17. The student was later killed in an accident while operating a motor vehicle for defendant. Defendant was found guilty by a jury of violating &sect; 62. However, defendant's motion to dismiss was granted. On the commonwealth's appeal, the court vacated the dismissal order. Specifically, the court found that both &sect; 62, 95 were not unconstitutional and that they could be read together. Moreover, even though it was reasonable for an employer to be confused and think that the educational certificate stood for more than it did, ignorance of the law was no excuse. The educational certificate did not mean that the student was at least 18, and the statutory scheme provided for strict liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated the order allowing the motion to dismiss. The court further found that the statutes in question withstood constitutional attack. The dismissal of the action by the commonwealth against defendant was reversed. A new trial was ordered to address defendant's violation of the statute prohibiting the employment of minors under 18 in operating motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of motor vehicle by negligent operation. He appealed the trial court's verdict, as well as the trial court's ruling that excluded evidence of the victim's prior acts or habitual behavior as probative of the victim's conduct during the fatal accident. The court affirmed, holding that the commonwealth established the required nexus between defendant's negligence and the injury to the victim, ruling out the victim as the sole cause of the accident. The court further reiterated the rule that habit is not admissible as a means of proving the commission of a particular act, making testimony about the victim's proneness to accidents inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant father appealed from an order of the District Court (Massachusetts), which following a finding of paternity order the father to pay plaintiff mother retroactive child support from the date of the child's birth, to pay the same weekly rate for the child's current support, and to add the child to his medical insurance plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court awarded child support to the mother of an illegitimate child and ordered the father to carry the child's health insurance. The father appealed and contended that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, &sect; 9(a), read in conjunction with ch. 209C, &sect; 1, which authorized orders in cases of illegitimacy for current support of a child, for retroactive support from the date of birth, and for provision of health insurance, violated equal protection rights of children of married parents and rights of unmarried parents. The court determined that the father lacked standing to raise the issue as to children and that both married parents and unmarried parents were required to provide support for their children. Thus, the court found no constitutional violation. The court found that the father knew or should have known that the child was his from the time of the child's birth and that the evidence showed that the award was not excessive. The court held that there was no scienter requirement in the provisions relating to support in ch. 209C, &sect; 9(a) and that the six-year statute of limitations that applied to criminal non-support actions under ch. 277 &sect; 63 did not apply to actions under ch. 209C.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A judgment awarding the mother of an illegitimate child retroactive child support, current child support, and ordering the father to provide health insurance for the child was affirmed as modified. The order was modified in accordance with an agreement between the parents that the mother would carry the child's insurance on her plan and that the father would reimburse her for the cost. The orders denying posttrial motions were also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff claimant challenged a ruling from the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts), which affirmed a decision of defendant Massachusetts Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) that denied the claimant's contention that he should be treated as a member of the Massachusetts retirement system no later than 1957, based on the claimant's summer employment in the 1950's with the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At issue was the date upon which the claimant became a member of the state's retirement system. The claimant urged that his summer employment in the 1950's with the MDC qualified him for membership no later than 1957. Membership prior to 1957, would have entitled the claimant to higher retirement benefits because the benefits would be computed on the basis of a two-year formula pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 10(2)(a) (1957) rather than a five-year formula pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 10(2)(a) (1987). CRAB ruled against the claimant, and the superior court affirmed the ruling. On appeal, the court agreed with the lower court. The court held that there was no error in the finding that the claimant was not a member of the state's retirement system during the time the claimant worked at the MDC.  Mass Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 3(2)(a)(iv) did not give the claimant automatic membership or an absolute right to membership after six calendar months. The fact that the claimant later &quot;bought back&quot; his services during those years for retirement purposes indicated that no deductions were made and that the claimant was not a member of the retirement system during his MDC service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of CRAB in the claimant's action to overturn CRAB's determination of the dates of the claimant's employment for retirement purposes.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the superintendent filed a motion to commit the prisoner to a treatment center. The trial court ordered the prisoner committed to the treatment center for an indeterminate term. In response to a complaint filed by petitioner, the trial court acknowledged that the commitment to the treatment facility was improper, vacated the order, and ordered petitioner returned to the correctional facility. He filed a petition for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied by the trial court. Petitioner sought review, contending that he should be released because the commitment order replaced his sentence and the relief from the commitment order indicated that he was no longer a sexually dangerous person. On appeal, the court held that the commitment was a nullity and did not effect the original sentence imposed nor did it declare that he was no longer a sexually dangerous person.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed the field sobriety tests and at the police station submitted to breathalyzer tests that registered as .18 and .19. At the arraignment, defendant's driver's license was suspended. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 263, &sect; 5A provided sufficient notice to a drunk driver that he was entitled to a blood test. The court found that the statute alerted a person accused of driving under the influence to the potential value of a medical examination, which, in the face of scientific innovation or particular circumstances, might have taken a form other than a blood test. The court found that under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24N, a blood test was the only test that rebutted the presumption of being under the influence expressed in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(1)(e).

The inmate contended that sanctions were illegally and unconstitutionally imposed against him for alleged disciplinary infractions occurring between 1982 and 1984. A Massachusetts superior court granted the commissioner's motion to dismiss on the grounds of untimeliness. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate alleged deficiencies in the challenged disciplinary reports' failure to bear a signature of either the shift commander or the disciplinary officer. The court stated that it was aware of no state regulation with such requirements. The inmate's allegations with respect to two of the reports, one from December 1982 and the other from May 1983, that the decisions failed adequately to describe the evidence relied upon or to state reasons for the sanctions imposed, would, if timely, be sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In affirming the judgment of the district court to grant the motion of the commission to dismiss, the court noted that the remedy for failure to adhere to regulations in prison disciplinary proceedings was an action in the nature of certiorari under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, &sect; 4. At the time the inmate's cause of action arose, the statute included a requirement that actions brought pursuant to it be commenced within two years of the proceeding being challenged.

The court affirmed, finding that the superior court did not abuse its in determining that the work constituted major alterations as it affected a substantial portion of the building and the cost of installing sprinklers was relatively minor in comparison with the estimated total cost of work. Further, the term &quot;major alterations&quot; had a sufficiently clear meaning to satisfy constitutional due process standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commonwealth appealed an order of the Superior Court, Hampden County (Massachusetts) that granted defendant's motion to dismiss the grand jury indictments for violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, &sect; 13B, endeavoring to interfere with a witness, and conspiracy with regard to the same statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The witness testified that she was beaten and robbed. The perpetrator was apprehended and charged with unarmed robbery. Defendant, a police lieutenant, approached a person at a bar believing her to be the witness and asked her to speak to the perpetrator's father about the incident. The woman approached was the niece of the witness. The father gave her money to drop the charges. The trial court held that the woman approached was not a witness and dismissed the indictment. On appeal, the court vacated the order and reinstated the indictments. The court reasoned that the intent of the legislature was to protect witnesses and to prevent interference with the administration of justice. Endeavor, as used in the statute, meant to punish any conduct that tried to influence, impede, or otherwise interfere with any witness. The conduct required a lower threshold of purposeful activity than attempt and the commonwealth did not have to show that defendant actually approached the witness. The court rejected defendant's constitutional argument that the statute was vague on its face as it was not previously raised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated the trial court's order that dismissed the two indictments against defendant and reinstated the indictments for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a 48-year-old man, was convicted under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 35A for two acts of licking the vagina of a 14-year-old neighbor that willingly allowed his actions. In affirming his convictions, the court held that &sect; 35A did not require the State to prove that there was public awareness of the acts. The court held further that neither &sect; 35A nor any other expression of legislative intent established 14 as a legal age for capacity to consent to a nonharmful battery. The court refused to construe &sect; 35A to make nonconsent an element and refused to require proof of public exposure of the unnatural and lascivious act for conviction under the statute. The court concluded that given case law on the issue, defendant had sufficient notice that his conduct could be found by a jury to be an unnatural and lascivious act. The court found no error in the jury instruction giving a general definition of the term &quot;unnatural and lascivious&quot; because it was paired with a specific instruction that a finding of cunnilingus would warrant the defendant's conviction under &sect; 35A.</SPAN></P>

The administrator appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that there was no dispute that the decedent was a trespasser, and that the train operator was statutorily exempt from negligence based on Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229, &sect; 2. The child-trespasser statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 85Q, was not applicable to the train operator because the operator was only an occupier of the land, not a landowner.

A defendant could apprehend within rough bounds where his duty lay, and these would correspond with the scope of the statute as described by the judge. Law enforcement officials could similarly understand what conduct was proscribed. Defendant sought to avail himself of an excuse, that he was overborne by his belief that a breaking-and-entering trial was unfair to him. This had some resemblance to a claim of &quot;duress,&quot; as the judge suggested, or, perhaps, of &quot;necessity.&quot; The trial judge might well have declined to instruct on sufficient excuse. However, defendant got more than he deserved when the judge did charge on the matter and assigned the burden of persuasion to the Commonwealth. The verdict was just.</SPAN></P>

The court held that little purpose would be served by reversing on a purely technical, procedural ground, when the losing party, having standing as a citizen to demand enforcement, need only reinitiate the proceeding. The court held that the traditional, broad citizens' right to require the building inspector to proceed against violations of a zoning ordinance or by-law survived the adoption of the new Zoning Act.

The injunction prevented any revocation of the facility's entertainment license until the case should be tried on its merits. The official protested the injunction and also sought to hold a public hearing under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 183A (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The facility was an eating and drinking establishment located outside the district designated in the Boston zoning code as an adult entertainment district.

The court affirmed the granting of the preliminary injunction, refraining from commenting on the constitutionality of the current statute until a trial could be held. However, the court modified the injunction to allow the official to conduct a public hearing at which the various effects on public health and safety could be discussed. The court stated that it wished to preserve the status quo until the time of trial; consequently, the prohibition on any suspension or revocation of the license had to be maintained.</SPAN></P>

The superior court granted petitioners' relief and denied the commissioner's request for a stay of the final orders. On appeal, the court vacated the judgments, holding that petitioners were not entitled to the relief sought. The court reasoned that the statute under which petitioners sought relief, which was Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 248, &sect;&sect; 1 et seq., no longer permitted a judge to issue of writ of habeas corpus at his discretion. The court therefore treated the action as a motion under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30(a), which provided the relief that petitioners sought. The court held, however, that petitioners were still not entitled to relief under Rule 30(a) because they failed to show that the commissioner's forfeitures were unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, adult white male, appealed the judgment of a Massachusetts superior court, which convicted defendant on a jury's verdict of violating the civil rights of three Asian persons, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 37. Defendant asserted that &sect; 37 was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence elicited at the trial was insufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The defendant was convicted for his actions in harassing three residents of a Cambodian household. Defendant and a gang of white males went to the house to retaliate against a Cambodian teenager for shooting a marble at one of the white males. Defendant punched the teenager, swung a stick at a Cambodian male who took his picture, and struck a third Cambodian male in the chest with a thrown stick. On defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 37, the court likened &sect; 37 to 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 242 and adopted federal decisions, which held that the &quot;willful&quot; requirement of &sect; 242 created a definiteness that informed a person as to what type of conduct was prohibited. Despite three distinctions between &sect; 242 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 37, &sect; 37 was not unconstitutionally vague. The jury had been properly instructed on the constitutional rights of the victims. The evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to support the finding that the victims were exercising the rights protected by &sect; 37, that defendant had been engaged in harassing the victims based on their national origin, and that defendant had assaulted them and then fled. The evidence supported that defendant acted willfully.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 2-57B(2) (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants owned boats that were tied on a slip in the city. The harbormaster notified them of the slip fee that was due, but they failed to pay the fee and were convicted. On appeal, they argued that the required payment was a tax and not a fee. The court held that the mooring and slip fee was a fee and not a tax. The services provided by the harbormaster were for the benefit of the parties required to pay the charges. Boat owners had a meaningful choice whether to pay the fee and take advantage of the service offered. The boats were movable, and the owners were free to keep them someplace other than in the city harbor. Rather than raising revenues generally, the charges collected directly compensated the city, at least in part, for the cost of providing the harbormaster's services. When Beverly, Mass., Revised Ordinances art. IX, &sect; 2-57B(2)(a) and (b) (1981) were read together, the ordinance was reasonably construed to authorize imposition of the fee on an annual basis and to require payment within a reasonable period of time after notice from the harbormaster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Upon complaint of a town, defendant, a corporation, was found guilty by a jury of six of multiple violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, the Wetlands Act. The violation of the statute charged in the complaint was that defendant had filled and altered a fresh water wetland that was subject to flooding. The district court (Massachusetts) imposed a fine, plus a surfine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue on appeal was what punishment the Act prescribed. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, specified that whomever violated any provision of that section was to be punished by a fine of not more than $ 1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. It further provided that each day or portion thereof of continuing violation constituted a separate offense. The jury found that defendant's violations of the Act persisted for about 1279 days, which exposed defendant to an enormous fine. Defendant argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 90 dealt with penalties for infractions under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131 and that the fifth paragraph of &sect; 90 limited the penalty for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40 to a fine of not less than $ 100 nor more than $ 5,000 or imprisonment for not more than two years, or both. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction, concluding that there was reasonable doubt about what sanction the legislature intended for violation of the Wetlands Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40. Thus, as to its penal provisions, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, read with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 90, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's judgment based on violation of the Wetlands Act and set aside the corresponding verdict.

Defendants claimed that the language contained in &sect; 26G stating that a sprinkler system was not required unless sufficient water and water pressure exists was unclear. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff on its complaint and defendants' counterclaim. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;sufficient water and water pressure exists&quot; meant that the owner of a building or addition to which the statute applied must have had access to a source of water sufficient to operate an adequate system of sprinklers, or the exemption applied. The statute gave defendants sufficient notice that they were required to install sprinklers in their addition and also afforded plaintiff sufficient guidance to determine that such installation was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a licensed assistant trainer, filed a petition with the court for interlocutory relief under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &sect; 118 and for an injunction under Mass. R. App. P. 6(a) from the denial by the Superior Court (Massachusetts) of his petition for a preliminary injunction to restrain defendant the State Racing Commission (commission) from interfering with his right to earn a living as a result of the racetrack's order of ejectment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trainer was employed at a racetrack when a state trooper took him into custody; he was searched and accused of selling drugs. The court found that the trainer's substituted complaint and affidavit provided little information except that the item police seized was a list of names with dollar amounts next to the names and that without a hearing he was permanently ejected the racetrack. The court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 128A provided for strict regulation of horse racing and that under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 128A, &sect; 9 the commission had the full power to prescribe rules, regulations, and conditions under which all horse races were to be conducted. Further, the court held that in testing the constitutionality of a commission regulation, all rational presumptions were made in favor of the validity of the regulation. The court then concluded the trainer did not establish that it was an abuse of discretion to deny a preliminary injunction. Thus, the court affirmed finding that the trainer was potentially employable in other occupations and that it was important to avoid any suspicion or appearance of participation by the trainer, a licensee, in unlawful drug participation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the order denying the trainer's petition for interlocutory relief from the trial court's order denying his petition for a preliminary injunction to restrain the commission from interfering with his right to earn a living as a result of the racetrack's order of ejectment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that the parents were unfit to serve the best interests of the children; their consent to future adoption was not required. The court found that the probate court's findings were not plainly wrong and must be respected upon review.

As a result, he struck and killed a man who was replacing a flat tire in the breakdown lane. Defendant was convicted by a jury of vehicular homicide under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24G(a), and of knowingly leaving the scene of an accident after causing personal injury under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24(2)(a). He was sentenced to 9 to 10 years in prison for the vehicular homicide; and to 2 years in prison for leaving the scene, suspended, with probation for 5 years, to commence upon final parole on the vehicular homicide sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court held that even if certain of the trial judge's instructions to the jury were inadequate, defendant did not object to those instructions at trial and he did not show that, with respect to those instructions, there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Furthermore, because Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 24 applied to sentences under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 24G(a), the eligibility for parole was necessarily implicated, subject, however, to the mandatory requirement of one year in prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the judgment of a district court (Massachusetts) convicting her, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53, of being a common night walker, habitually walking the streets in the nighttime for the purpose of prostitution. Defendant contended that evidence of a specific and express act of solicitation was required to prove the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The evidence received was that on repeated occasions, over a period of two or three months, the arresting officer had seen defendant in an area frequented by prostitutes. The officer testified that defendant regularly stood on a corner at night, conversed with male motorists, and got into their vehicles. On the night of her arrest, defendant was at the usual location; a car driven by a man pulled up and stopped by her; defendant talked to the man and started to enter his car. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court held that circumstantial evidence could have made out a case under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53. Evidence of solicitation through testimony of the person propositioned or of someone who heard a proposition made was not required. The time, place, and frequency of defendant's conduct could have warranted an inference that on each occasion observed by police, defendant was soliciting men for illicit sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were convicted of unlawfully carrying a firearm, unlawful possession of an altered firearm, and unlawful possession of cocaine, with intent to distribute following a police officer's seizure of drugs and weapons after a warrantless search of defendants' car. Defendants appealed the convictions asserting, inter alia, that the officer pursued their car without legal justification in violation of their rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and that a search into the trunk was illegal because it was not justified by probable cause. The court affirmed the convictions. The court determined that the officer's surveillance of the car did not encroach upon defendants' privacy interests because the officer made his observations from a place where he was legally entitled to be. The court found that after he first saw defendants' car on a public highway, the officer simply positioned his cruiser a short distance behind the car in order to observe its operation. The court also held that the search of the trunk was justified because the officer found a firearm and contraband in the passenger compartment and the trunk was a part of the car capable of concealing the object of the search.</SPAN></P>

She appealed the convictions to a jury session and filed a motion to dismiss the complaints alleging discriminatory enforcement of the statutes.

A police detective testified that it was the standard practice of the department to only arrest the female prostitutes. The reviewing court granted defendant's motion and the commonwealth appealed. The court affirmed the dismissal. The court concluded from the evidence that the practice of the municipal police department was to arrest female prostitutes but not to arrest their male customers or male prostitutes. The court determined that defendant met her burden of showing that (1) a broader class of persons than those prosecuted had violated the law; (2) the failure to prosecute was either consistent or deliberate; and (3) that the decision not to prosecute was based on an impermissible classification of sex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed from the superior court (Massachusetts), which convicted them of trafficking in 200 or more grams of cocaine and of distributing cocaine in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A (1982). Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statute and argued that the sentences were cruel and unusual, a statement by one of them should have been suppressed, and the trial court should have given the entrapment instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants did not dispute whether they had possessed or sold cocaine but claimed instead that they had been entrapped by the actions of an undercover state police trooper and a police informant. The court disagreed and affirmed their convictions. The court found no ambiguity in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32E(b) and concluded that the statute, on its face, set out with sufficient clarity ascertainable standards of guilt. The court also found that the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect;&sect; 32E(b) (3) and 32H was not cruel and unusual, even when applied to offenders like defendants, who had no previous record involving drug offenses. The court also agreed that the motion judge could permissibly have concluded defendant had volunteered his statement after having received and understood the Miranda warnings, perhaps to curry favor with the police. Finally, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to raise an issue as to entrapment because it did not show a sufficient nexus between the government's activity with defendants' conduct. Therefore, the rejection of the proposed instruction on entrapment was not error.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found against the inmates, declaring that neither of them was serving a life term within the meaning of &sect; 48A. Affirming, the court found that the phrase &quot;life term&quot; was limited to those prisoners who were sentenced to life imprisonment. It did not apply broadly to inmates whose aggregate sentences exceeded their statistical life expectancies. Such a legislative classification was not irrational and unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause because it was permissible for the legislature to treat persons with life sentences differently from persons with ascertainable release dates.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 119, &sect; 23(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The department obtained temporary custody of the child and placed her in foster care. The probate court subsequently found respondents unfit as parents and granted custody of the child to the department. On appeal, the court affirmed. The probate judge was warranted in concluding, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that neither the mother nor the father was a fit parent for the child and that the department should have custody. The mother's potential to be a fit custodial parent, demonstrated by changes in her life situation, had not materialized to an extent sufficient to justify a change in the custodial arrangement. The father had less potential as a primary caretaker than the mother. He was unable to offer the child a stable home environment or financial support. There was considerably more on the record than poverty, an unconventional life-style, and a concern for maintaining the status quo. Any procedural irregularities by the department, if they existed, would not have justified setting aside the probate court's order. The department dealt with the parties reasonably and in good faith in carrying out its primary mission, ensuring the welfare of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The purpose of the conspiracy was for defendants to solicit and receive money in the guise of campaign contributions in return for defendants' being influenced in an official act. The court held that the complete record was examined and concluded that defendants received a fair trial and that reversal of their convictions was not required. The court found that the judge's approach to instructing the jury concerning the lesser-included offense was not unfair. Defendants were fully apprised of the possibility of conviction of conspiracy to commit the lesser-included offense. Therefore, there was no prejudice by the judge's dismissing count two and charging that crime as a lesser-included offense. Further, there was ample evidence that defendants crossed the line and actively participated in the conspiracy. In addition, there was evidence that defendant was the recipient of approximately thousands of dollars in checks. The evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude that defendants knew of the existence and objective of the conspiracy and that they participated in it. The court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The nightclub asserted that it had not changed its use of the premises and that the portions of the state building code relied on by the building inspector were unconstitutionally vague. The court confined its review to the record of proceedings before the board. The court found that the record showed a total failure by the nightclub to make, before the board, the requisite showing that the building code enforcement system had a discriminatory effect or that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. The original certificate of inspection and occupancy classified the use as &quot;lounge/restaurant,&quot; which would be an F3 use. At least one and perhaps two later certificates of inspection and occupancy referred to the use classification as &quot;F2/club,&quot; which would mean &quot;nightclub.&quot; The court affirmed the judgment and found that the code provisions in question were not shown to affect the nightclub's ability to offer nude entertainment. It merely required that the public safety regulations applicable to such a change of use would be followed. The court held that the distinction between a restaurant and a nightclub comported with common usage and was a reasonable interpretation of the code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 71, &sect; 42, and which held that the assistant principal was not entitled to an individual hearing for an alleged unconstitutional deprivation of his property rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Committee adopted a reorganization plan that abolished five junior high schools and established middle schools. As a result, plaintiffs' jobs were eliminated and they were effectively demoted. Plaintiffs, under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 71, &sect; 43A, as amended by 1977 Mass. Acts 671, and under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 231A, complained that they were entitled to demotion hearings under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 71, &sect; 42. The assistant principal also separately argued an unconstitutional deprivation of property rights. The superior court found that the elimination of plaintiffs' jobs was based on educational policy, undertaken in good faith, and thus no hearings either under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 71, &sect; 42A, or the state or federal constitutions were required. In affirming the judgment, the court held that there was ample evidence to support the findings of the superior court that the demotions were not based on grounds that were arbitrary or irrelevant to the task of running the school system.

The police then arranged a one-on-one confrontation of defendant by a victim whose apartment had been broken into several hours earlier.

The court noted that a letter from a prisoner might have given rise to justifiable apprehension on the part of the recipient that the threat would have been carried out. The court also noted that defendant's mother-in-law could reasonably have believed that defendant actually had the ability to cause her bodily harm, either personally after his release or through the employment of an agent.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the record was inadequate because the correction officer's statement was unsworn, professed no particular experience with, or technical understanding of the drug, and conceded on its face that the substance was unknown.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dealership proudly sold all of its cars, irrespective of customer request, with accessory service or components such as rustproofing, paint sealant, security locks, door edge guards, body pin stripes, and mud guards, all of which were added to cars upon the dealership's order after they arrived in Massachusetts. On behalf of the commonwealth, the attorney general brought an action to restrain the dealership from engaging in such &quot;option packing.&quot; The superior court issued a preliminary injunction against the dealership continuing the practice. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the prohibition of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &sect; 4(4)(a), against requiring acceptance of undesired options as a condition of sale and delivery thereof, was intended to prohibit imposition of the condition at the time a customer signed a purchase order. The court held that the statute plainly sought to afford car buyers the opportunity to purchase vehicles in the same condition as that in which the manufacturer sent them, where any other reading would basically tell prospective buyers to &quot;take it or leave it,&quot; depriving consumers of the free choice the statute intended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A superior court (Massachusetts) reported two questions to the court, which were (1) whether the penalty provisions of the 1982 version of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32E(b)(3) were unconstitutionally vague, and, (2) if not, whether they were ambiguous when read in conjunction with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 24, which set forth the general standards for indeterminate sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were indicted for trafficking in 200 or more grams of cocaine, a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32E(b)(3), as it appeared in 1982 Mass. Acts ch. 650, &sect; 11. They contended that the 1982 amendments to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32E(b)(3) had rendered that provision unconstitutionally vague and sought the indictment's dismissal on that ground. The superior court reported two questions to the court. The court answered &quot;no&quot; to both questions. Section 32E was divided into three subsections, which addressed marihuana, cocaine, and heroin, and each subsection applied only to traffickers in the identified narcotic. Within each subsection, a range of penalties were specified depending upon the amount involved. The court found that the mandatory minimum sentence specified by &sect; 32(E)(a)(1) only applied to marihuana trafficking. Moreover, &quot;herein&quot; and &quot;section,&quot; as used by &sect; 32(E)(a)(1), only applied to that provision. Therefore, &sect; 32E was not unconstitutional on account of vagueness. Section 32E also did not conflict with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 24 in that the former provision did not prevent judges from sentencing offenders to facilities other than state prisons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted by a jury of six of disseminating an obscene film. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected the argument that the trial judge was biased, because of statements he made in connection with an earlier obscenity case against the same defendant. The court noted that the statements related to the judge's preference to combine all of defendant's cases into a single trial, not any bias against defendant. The court held that the exclusion of part of the defense expert's testimony was error. The court noted that the witness was permitted to testify as to the literary value of the film, but not the artistic value of the film. The court held that the two concepts were so intertwined that the exclusion of testimony on one of the two was harmless. The court also held that an objection to a jury instruction had to be made at trial, and could not be raised for the first time on appeal. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that the conviction was tainted by a poster, which was not listed in the search warrant, but was seized and entered into evidence, since the poster showed the same obscenity demonstrated in the movie itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owner appealed an order from the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) that granted summary judgment for defendants, planning board, board of appeals, and board of health, after the planning board refused to give an approval-not-required endorsement for his project and the board of appeals denied his special permit request. The property owner also sought a declaration that septic system regulations were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board of appeals granted prior owners a special permit to develop their land provided that the units were detached. After the property owner acquired the land, he applied to the board of appeals for a special permit to construct multi-family units but the application was denied, and the planning board denied his request for an endorsement under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 41, &sect; 81P. The property owner filed three actions: two for review of the denials, and the last against the board of health to attack the constitutionality of its septic system regulations. The trial court granted summary judgment to all defendants, and on appeal, the court affirmed the orders in the planning board and board of health cases. The planning board correctly denied the &sect; 81P endorsement because the property owner's plan did not comply with the detached unit condition; thus, independent approval was required. The trial judge was also correct in ruling that no controversy yet existed with the board of health. However, the board of appeals order was reversed because the trial judge's summary affirmance of the special permit denial was erroneously based on the detached unit condition of the first plan approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's order that granted summary judgment to the planning board and the board of health in the property owner's actions to review the denial of a project endorsement and to challenge the constitutionality of septic regulations. However, the court reversed the board of appeal's denial of a special permit and remanded that case.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the court found that probable cause and exigent circumstances existed justifying a warrantless search of the vehicle, when the police officers' sighted of the automobile as described by the informant. The court rejected the passenger defendant's argument that the commonwealth failed to prove knowledge and possession, which were two elements of the charged offense. The court found that defendant's renting the car and referring to the drugs during his arrest supported a finding of the essential elements. Affirming the convictions, the court vacated their sentences because of an ambiguity in clause 1 of &sect; 32E(c) and remanded both cases for resentencing under the general provisions of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted on a charge of violating &sect; 28(a). Prior to trial, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that &sect; 28(a) was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted conviction when a person merely had a &quot;reason to know&quot; that the vehicle in his possession was stolen. The trial court denied the motion, but directed that the indictment be read to the jury with the offending language from the statute omitted. Upon a jury verdict of guilty, the trial court entered defendant's conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. Specifically, the court found that defendant had not shown that the remaining portions of &sect; 28(a), under which he had been indicted, must fall even if the portion with the offending language were invalid. Moreover, the court concluded that the words in &sect; 28(a) to which defendant objected, even if offending, did not defeat the remainder of the section. Finally, the court held that, although the trial court unilaterally amended the indictment by changing the way it was read to the jury, the amendment did not change the substance of the crime as charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with possession of heroin with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and carrying, without a license, a firearm in a motor vehicle. The trial court convicted defendant.

The court held that: (1) even if, because of the physical facts, there was an abstract possibility of conflicting interpretations of the warrant with respect to the location of the apartment, under the circumstances, there was no reason to apply the exclusionary rule; (2) defendant's argument that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area within his companion's blouse, where some drugs were located, was without merit; and (3) the prosecution conceded that defendant's conviction of possession of heroin with intent to distribute had to be vacated because the statute under which he was convicted had been declared unconstitutional after the trial and sentencing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment that the trial court entered in the board's favor. At issue was the proper construction of 1906 Mass. Acts 291, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, which created the board and pertained to its financing. In construing legislative intent, the court examined the 1906 Act in connection with its development, its progression through the legislative body, the history of the time, prior legislation, and in light of the constitution and of the common law. The court concluded that the legislature intended to prevent the exercise of discretion on the city's part. Any power of the mayor and city council to determine the amount of the board's appropriations would have had to be explicitly stated. The court noted that no such explicit grant of power appeared in the 1906 Act or in any subsequent amendment. Moreover, there were clear indications that the 1906 act and its predecessor, 1885 Mass. Acts 323, were passed with the intention of separating the authority of the licensing board from that of the mayor and city council.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was sentenced to a five-year term of mandatory imprisonment after he was convicted of the sale of heroin.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed his conviction by a jury in the superior court (Massachusetts) for possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &sect; 32A(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two officers saw defendant exchange drugs for currency in front of a bar. When he was arrested, 2.8 grams of cocaine were seized from his jacket pocket. Defendant argued that the small quantity of drugs and the paraphernalia removed during a subsequent search of his apartment were consistent with personal use of the drug. At trial the assistant district attorney made an opening statement. Defense counsel stated his intention to make an opening at that time, but the trial judge would not permit defendant to open until after the Commonwealth had rested. Defendant was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that nothing in Mass. R. Crim. P. 24(a)(1) granted the trial judge the discretion of dictating when defendant could make an opening statement. The rule clearly permitted defendant's opening after the opening of the Commonwealth or after the close of the Commonwealth's case. The decision was a tactical one for defense counsel to make. Since the jury was highly impressionable at the outset of the trial, it was unfair to deny counsel the opportunity to present defendant's side of the case at that time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer owned five lots in the town of Kingston. Tax bills sent to the taxpayer's home went unanswered. A demand for taxes, similarly addressed, also was never returned. The town subsequently took the lots under the &quot;lands of low value&quot; procedure set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 60, &sect;&sect; 79 and 80. The town then conveyed the property to the landowner. Several years later, the taxpayer's heir claimed an interest in the land. The taxpayer's heir argued that the taxpayer had died prior to the tax assessment and thus never received the tax bills or demand. The landowner's heirs opposed the action. The land court ruled that the taxpayer's heir had no interest in the property. The taxpayer's heir sought review, and the court affirmed. The court acknowledged that the tax assessor was charged with knowledge of the taxpayer's death because a search of the probate records would have revealed the fact of death and the appointment of the taxpayer's son as administrator of his estate. However, the court said, because the tax bills were sent to the taxpayer's address, at which his daughter still resided, the estate had actual knowledge of the tax assessment and demand for payment.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the trial judge that &sect; 201 did not authorize the type of inspection that was conducted in this case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant Town of Chatham sought review of a judgment from a land court department (Massachusetts), which found in favor of plaintiff property owner in his action pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 240, &sect; 14A and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 185, &sect; 1(j)(1/2) to determine the scope and validity of a wetland setback provision that was provided in the town's zoning bylaws as was applied to his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner's application for a building permit was denied based upon a zoning bylaw which prohibited building within 25 feet of wetlands as defined in the Town's bylaws. The court reversed the land court's judgment which ruled that the setback requirement did not apply to the owner's property. The land court based its judgment upon &sect; 1.63 of the Town's zoning bylaws which defined &quot;wetlands&quot; because the definition was so vague that it gave rise to constitutional problems. The court determined that the law was not unconstitutionally vague simply because it presented some questions as to its application in particular instances. The definition of wetlands had respected antecedents in key definitions in the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 40, which may have been used to supply standards for applying the phrase &quot;natural growth indicative of wetlands&quot; in the Town's bylaws. The standard for judging the constitutionality of zoning bylaws was that if the general policy was stated with reasonable clarity, then the detailed application of the policy to particular fact situations may have been appropriately left to administrative bodies and the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the land court's judgment and entered a new judgment that declared that the setback provision and the definition of inland wetlands were valid exercises of the town's zoning power, that the setback provision applied to the owner's property, and that the owner was not entitled to build a guest house in the location that was indicated in his application for a building permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was 69 years of age when she was hired as a clerk-typist to work in the office of the State Secretary.

The court held that &sect; 90F was expressly limited to a &quot;member in service,&quot; which the employee was not, and that such exemption from mandatory retirement for members was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a doctor, was convicted of multiple counts of indecent assault and battery and unlawful distribution of controlled substances after undercover state troopers posed as patients and obtained drug prescriptions from defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant owners disputed a declaratory judgment of a Superior Court (Massachusetts), which dismissed their action challenging decisions of appellee Board of Appeals of Acushnet (board). The owners argued that three board members could have rendered a decision, there was insufficient notice of a rehearing, the findings in support of a denial of a variance were inadequate, a zoning bylaw was invalid, and they had acquired a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Having run a mobile home park on their property prior to a zoning bylaw amendment, the owners thereafter applied for a variance in order to expand the park. After one of four board members present at one hearing resigned, a new hearing was held and the variance was denied. The court held that the board acted properly in reserving action until at least four members could rehear the case. Although there was a defect in the required notice, it caused no prejudice. The owners had time to prepare for the hearing. The court held that there was sufficient explanation for the denial of a variance, especially on a record that fell short of establishing facts that would have authorized the board to grant one. The trial judge made an express finding that a nonconforming use did not exist. The court did not reach the owners' challenges to the zoning regulations; each failed procedurally. On a constitutional claim, the Massachusetts Attorney General was not notified. The board of appeals was not a proper forum for raising questions as to the validity of the zoning regulation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court ruled that defendant's attempt to introduce evidence of a tattoo on his victim, reflecting a prior sexual act with another woman, was properly excluded from evidence. The court rejected defendant's claim that the rape-shield law, Mass.  Gen. Law ch. 233, &sect; 21B, which was enacted after the time of his crime, was an unconstitutional ex-post facto law. The court also held that the trial court's ruling that, if he testified, evidence of defendant's prior illegitimacy proceeding would be admitted into evidence was harmless error because this would have had no effect on the jury's view of defendant's credibility given his prior larceny convictions. The court further held that defendant was not entitled to a reversal on appeal solely because he established that two of the witnesses who testified at trial committed perjury when testifying before the grand jury. The court stated that the perjury committed by the two witnesses before the grand jury was immaterial and that there was no reasonable likelihood that their false testimony could have effected the judgment of the grand jury to return an indictment against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff restaurant owners sought review of an order to the superior court (Massachusetts), which dissolved a preliminary injunction issued at their request that barred enforcement of a policy of defendant licensing board, which required all holders of restaurant licenses under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 12 to adhere to a uniform closing hour.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The restaurant owners argued that they did not receive hearings before the board of an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial nature, that the evidence adduced before the board did not warrant a conclusion that any of the restaurant owners had violated the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, and the board was not warranted in curtailing their licenses. The court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 12(6) gave a local licensing board a virtually unlimited and unreviewable discretion to determine the closing hours of a restaurant licensee between the hours of 11:00 P.M. and 2:00 A.M., so long as the board had accorded the licensee a statutorily proper hearing. The court found that the board had correctly taken the position that the hearing was legislative, or regulatory, rather than quasi-judicial in nature. The court stated that where the board's power was not used against a particular license-holder based on alleged violations, but was instead employed as part of a policy of general application to all license-holders based on public safety considerations, the court did not see how rights protected under the constitution were implicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board denied the commercial billboard owner's applications to renew permits for off-premises signs because they did not conform to local by-laws. On judicial review, the trial court granted summary judgment affirming the board's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment. The court held that the board had jurisdiction over the signs under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, &sect;&sect; 29, 30. The board's determination that the signs were of the off-premises type was adequately supported by the evidence. The requirements of the town's sign by-law applied to the signs. Pre-existing nonconforming signs were not protected. The zoning by-law's general ban on off-premises signs did not infringe the commercial billboard owner's First Amendment right to engage in commercial speech. It was a valid regulation of the commercial billboard owner's exercise of First Amendment free speech rights because it was no broader than necessary to meet the government's substantial interests in traffic safety and the appearance of the city. The court accepted the legislature's judgment that the general prohibition of off-premises signs directly advanced those interests.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 215, &sect; 13, the court was asked whether an illegitimate child was the heir of his or her father in circumstances where the father had not acknowledged the child as his in writing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent never married the mother of the children, and there was no adjudication of paternity. However, the decedent acknowledged the children as his children. There were two petitions for administration of the estate. The illegitimate daughter brought one and the brother brought the other. The court found that a recent decision did not change the law but simply declared the status of the law as affected by the Equal Rights Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution, which law it applied it to the instant action. The illegitimate daughter was not foreclosed from petitioning to administer her father's estate. The court found, however, that nothing disclosed the basis on which the probate court judge decided that the daughter was qualified to be the administrator of the estate, and there were no facts that enabled the court to so decide. Thus, the case was not proper for report under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 215, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts appealed a judgment from the Superior Court Department (Massachusetts) that made a forfeiture of defendant motor vehicle (van) subject to intervenor credit company's security interest in a district attorney's forfeiture suit under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 94C, &sect; 47, after police seized the van when arresting its owner on a charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner bought the van using the company's financing. Modifying the judgment, the court said that the Massachusetts Legislature's determination that a secured party's rights had to be subordinated to the government's interest could not be judicially revised, and that &sect; 47 as applied to someone in the company's position was not constitutionally oppressive. The word &quot;owner&quot; appearing in the first sentence of &sect; 47(c)(3) did not include a secured party in the company's position. The court noted an absence of factors that could have rendered government interference with property rights subject to substantive due process questions. The company was charged with knowledge when it acquired its interest that secured parties were not excepted from the effect of a forfeiture under &sect; 47. The company must have foreseen and taken into account the occasional loss of a security interest to forfeiture. Forfeiture did not extinguish the underlying debt. Though the owner's status after conviction could render collection impractical, that factor did not require invalidation of the forfeiture as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment as modified to strike the words &quot;subject to security interest&quot; of the company.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53, as amended, and (b) carrying without authority on her person or under her control in a motor vehicle a dangerous weapon in violation of Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The vice squad testified that they observed defendant stop cars with sole male drivers, get into one car, and pull down the driver's pants. Upon arrest, the officers found an eight-inch bread knife in her purse. Defendant objected to the jury charge that &quot;soliciting sexual contact or conduct would amount to the crime of disorderly person.&quot; The court reversed the convictions. &quot;Disorderly persons&quot; as used in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 53 was strictly construed to preserve it from the defect of unconstitutional vagueness by incorporation of the provisions of the Model Penal Code &sect; 250.2, which was confined to intentional conduct, usually somewhat violent, which tended to disturb the public tranquility. Sexual solicitation and prostitution properly should not be prosecuted under the &quot;disorderly persons&quot; provision. Carrying the knife did not warrant a prosecution under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(b) because the complaint did not charge that defendant was armed when arrested upon a warrant for crime or when arrested while committing a breach or disturbance of the public peace, a necessary element of an offense under ch. 269, &sect; 10(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The contract, a standard form of agreement drafted by the Commonwealth, conferred upon the architectural firm an unconditional release of all liability, including design errors, before construction on the project even began. The court reversed the grants of summary judgment in favor of the architectural firm because the language of the release effectively nullified the statutory mandate of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 7, &sect;&sect; 30C and 30E, which imposed a certain standard of care upon architects. The court held that it would not give the release literal effect because the architectural firm was bound by the general rule that persons who deal with a governmental agency must take notice of limitations upon that agency's contracting power. Thus, the release did not operate to relieve the architectural firm of its professional responsibilities under the contract.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision of the board. The determination of the taxpayer's principal location was a question of fact that was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or inconsistent with the agreed facts. The court found that the board properly interpreted the terms &quot;contiguous to&quot; or &quot;part of, &quot; and its conclusion that the president's house was not contiguous to the principal location of the university was warranted by the evidence. Finally, the court held that the statute could be applied retroactively because tax statutes could be made retroactive if the legislature so intended, as long as the retroactive feature was not arbitrary and burdensome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs owned and operated a combination newsstand, variety store, and &quot;adult bookstore&quot; on adjoining premises. State police officers assigned to the district attorney's office twice executed warrants of the premises, the execution of which led to confiscation of the adult bookstore's entire inventory. After the first search and seizure, civil in rem proceedings were filed and indictments were returned against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs filed a civil action and claimed that the searches were a ruse to put the bookstore out of business, that they were conducted in a manner that encroached on protected First Amendment rights, and that they would be repeated unless preliminary relief was granted. The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which denied plaintiffs' requests for preliminary relief. Although plaintiffs would have been entitled to some relief against the prospect of future indiscriminate searches and seizures and an order directing that seized property be returned except for that needed for introduction in evidence at the trials, plaintiffs' request for relief was too broad. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the extraordinary relief sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate was arrested for performing fellatio upon a minor. The inmate pleaded guilty and was convicted under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 35A. The inmate was confined to the treatment center of the prison. The inmate petitioned for release. The State's psychiatric experts testified that the inmate had sex with the youngest inmates and fantasized that he lived a closed community full of nude children who fondled each other. The trial court denied the petition. The inmate appealed. The trial court finding that defendant's sexual behavior was repetitive, compulsive, and aggressive against children, which made him a sexually dangerous person under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 1, was supported by substantial evidence. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 35A was not constitutionally vague as applied to the inmate's conduct because, even though the minor consented, the inmate had notice that his actions were criminal. The validity of the guilty plea and waiver of counsel were not subject to review because those issues were not raised before the trial court. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect;&sect; 1, 9 were clear and straightforward and were not, therefore, unconstitutionally vague upon their face.</SPAN></P>

The commonwealth proceeded on the theory that defendant had committed larceny by false pretenses. Defendant was convicted of all charges.

The affidavit supporting the search warrant established probable cause to believe that defendant was involved in a scheme to defraud his customers by keeping premium money turned over to him.

The Commission used the wrong standard to measure the constitutional validity of the regulation by looking for a factual justification in terms of proof by the board of a compelling governmental interest for the rule. The findings of the hearing officer that the rule was designed to promote appearance and cultivate morale among some members of the department and respect by the public was enough to settle the rule's validity.

The city council also sought injunctions prohibiting the DPU from issuing licenses pursuant to either statute and the bus line from operating its motor vehicles pursuant to the license it held under 1973 Mass. Acts ch. 527. The trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of the DPU and the bus line. The court held that: (1) there was a presumption of constitutionality of a legislative enactment, which meant that all rational inferences were made in favor of the legislation; (2) there was no merit to the city council's contention that because the statutes in question were special laws that related only to one city, they violated Mass. Const. art. 89; and (3) because the predominant purposes of the statutes were to achieve state, regional, or general objectives, the legislature possessed legislative power, unaffected by the restrictions in Mass. Const. art. 89, to enact them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant hired an undercover agent, who was posing as a &quot;torch,&quot; to burn two buildings. They agreed that one building would be burned immediately and another in several weeks. After defendant dropped off a can of turpentine to the first building, he was arrested. On appeal from his conviction, defendant attacked the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &sect; 5A. The court found sufficient evidence to prove that defendant placed the turpentine in the first building with the intent to use it to burn that building because defendant and the &quot;torch&quot; had agreed that the first building would be burned that night. The court also found sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to burn the second building because he placed the turpentine in the first building preparatory to the execution of his intent to burn that building several weeks later. The court also held that &sect; 5A was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because the statutory use of the word &quot;eventually&quot; pertained to the burning and not the intention to burn; the intent to burn clearly existed, as required, at the time the turpentine was placed in preparation for the fire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a decision by the superior court (Massachusetts), which convicted him of armed robbery after a jury trial. He appealed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &sect;&sect; 33A-33G, claiming it was error for the trial judge not to conduct an evidentiary hearing on his own initiative immediately before trial on defendant's competence to stand trial. He also challenged the constitutionality of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect;&sect; 47, 48.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A court-appointed psychiatrist determined that defendant was a drug addict who could not participate effectively in his own defense, but that he would be able to do so in seven days, depending on his daily drug intake. Without making a competency finding, the trial judge revoked defendant's bail, committed him to jail, and continued the case for one week. The trial proceeded the next week without further reference to defendant's competence, and defendant failed to raise the issue at trial. The court held that a substantial question existed as to defendant's competency when the case was first called, which required the trial judge to hold an evidentiary hearing on his own motion. It found nothing in the record to indicate that the issue was resolved before trial, held that the trial judge could not rely on the psychiatrist's conditional prediction of competency, and concluded that defendant was entitled to a new trial preceded by a determination of his competence. The court found that the differentiations between drug related and non-drug related offenders in the challenged statutes were not without a reasonable basis or purely arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The court first rejected the argument that the negligent operation of a motor vehicle resulting in death statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court explained that in order to withstand due process requirements, a criminal statute had to be sufficiently clear so as to provide notice of the prohibited conduct. The court found that the statute satisfied such criteria because it explicitly set forth the elements necessary for criminal culpability. The court explained that the term &quot;negligently&quot; afforded sufficient notice. The court further found no error in the jury instruction defining ordinary negligence rather than wanton or reckless conduct as the applicable standard because the statute's language indicated legislative intent that a finding of ordinary negligence was sufficient to establish a violation. The court found no error in the denial of a motion to suppress statements because defendant was given Miranda warnings and voluntarily waived his rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A male intruder awakened the victim, held a knife to her throat, and sexually assaulted her. A detective applied for a warrant to search defendant's apartment. The affidavit accompanying the application for the warrant stated that the victim described the intruder as a man of about 25 to 30 years, tall and thin, and wearing no shoes. The victim later found a typewritten note in her mailbox, apparently left by the rapist. The affidavit stated that material in the note indicated to police officers that the intruder might live in the area. The police made a door to door canvass of the area where they questioned three young girls. The girls directed the officers to a house where, they stated, there lived a man of about 25 to 30 years, tall and thin, who never wore shoes. On appeal, the court held that the affidavit supported the magistrate's finding that probable cause existed to issue a search warrant. The affidavit satisfied the two-prong Aguilar test. It informed the magistrate of some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informants were reliable and of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informants drew their conclusions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, water division, sewer commission, town, and subdivisions, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which ruled that plaintiff town had standing to bring its action and that the director of the division had exceeded his authority in issuing advisory rulings on sewer permits in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21, &sect; 43.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The advisory rulings exempted the subdivisions from obtaining permits to connect to the sewer serving the two towns. Plaintiff claimed that the rulings violated &sect; 43. The trial court ruled that plaintiff had standing to bring the action and that the division exceeded its authority in issuing the rulings. The court dismissed the appeal of the subdivisions. The court found that plaintiff's interest in the purity of the water supply was protected by the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act and held that it was a &quot;person aggrieved&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 46A. The court also found that there was no procedure for further administrative review of the division's decision. Because plaintiff was aggrieved by the division's determination, the court held that judicial review under &sect; 46A was allowable. The court also held that the advisory rulings were not in accordance with &sect; 43. The court found that although the division had general power under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 8 to make advisory rulings with respect to the applicability of any statute administered by the agency, such rulings could not be contrary to statute and the division had issued no regulation concerning exemptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court dismissed the appeal of the subdivisions and remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration in light of its rulings that plaintiff had standing to bring suit and that the advisory rulings issued by the division were invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff settlor appealed a decision of the Probate Court for the county of Suffolk (Massachusetts), which dismissed his complaint against defendants, trustee, wife, brother and his three daughters, and unknown heirs, seeking to invalidate or to reform his irrevocable indenture of trust on the ground that he was induced to execute the instrument through undue influence. The settlor also appealed the award of counsel fees in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The settlor learned that he had an illegitimate daughter that would not have been a beneficiary of his trust. He sought to invalidate or to reform his irrevocable trust on the ground that he was induced to execute the instrument through undue influence. The probate judge concluded that the burden of proving undue influence had not been sustained by the settlor. The probate judge dismissed the settlor's complaint and awarded counsel fees and costs to defendants. The probate judge concluded that the settlor's stated purpose in bringing the proceeding was to terminate the trust so that he could have used the funds directly for his daughter's benefit or to enable him to include her as a trust beneficiary. The settlor appealed, and the court affirmed. The court concluded that the settlor failed to carry his burden of proving that he would not have executed the trust instrument had it not been for the undue influence exerted on him by his mother and grandmother. The court stated that the probate judge was not required to believe the settlor's version of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the trust, and that the events he described did not constitute undue influence.</SPAN></P>

Contrary to defendants' assertion, the court upheld the seizure of evidence because the magistrate was not required to view the film prior to issuing a warrant. In addition, the warrant was not impermissibly vague because the executing officers understood the types and numbers of items to be seized and defendants failed to identify any seized documents that did not relate to the crime charged. The court also held that defendants did not demonstrate a need for a statewide venire, that the lower court's examination of prospective jurors was careful, and that prospective jurors were adequately questioned concerning their possible bias or prejudice. In addition, the court rejected the claim that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 29 did not proscribe the charged conduct. Further, the court held that the jury instructions were not coercive and they accurately stated the law. The court also upheld the lower court's evidentiary rulings, particularly its denial of defendants' request for a view of the adult entertainment district, because there was no showing of an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, tenants and owner, sought review of the judgment of the Housing Court of the City of Boston (Massachusetts), which upheld the decision of appellee administrator increasing the rents at an apartment complex under 1970 Mass. Acts 842. Appellants, administrator and tenants, challenged a second housing court judgment, which found that the administrator's subsequent reduction of rents was null and void. Appellee owner filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Three months after the administrator increased the gross maximum rental, he reduced it. The tenants argued that the upward adjustment was invalid because the administrator did not comply with his own regulations and the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The owner urged on cross-appeal that the tenants' appeal from the administrator's decision was untimely. The owner claimed the court should limit its review of the second decision to a consideration of whether the housing court judge applied the correct standard of review. The court reversed both housing court decisions. The court found that the first adjustment was invalid because it did not comply with Boston, Mass., Rent Control Admin. Reg. 6 and that Reg. 3, &sect; 10 was ultra vires insofar as it set a seven-day time limit for appeals. The court held that the housing court applied the wrong legal standard in the second case. The court determined that neither 1970 Mass. Acts ch. 843 nor the federal or state constitutions required a fair return on fair market value and that the owner failed to show that the lower rents were confiscatory or did not yield a fair net operating income or return on investment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the housing court's judgment that upheld the administrator's decision to increase the rents and ordered that the case be remanded to the administrator for a redetermination of the adjustment in accordance with the administrator's regulations. The court also reversed the housing court's second judgment and ordered the housing court to affirm the administrator's decision to reduce the rents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Superior Court (Massachusetts) for unnatural sexual intercourse, a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 22 (1974). Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss on the grounds that &sect; 22 was unconstitutionally vague and conferred an unconstitutional measure of discretion on the prosecution in proceeding under &sect; 22 or some other statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with two counts of violating &sect; 22. The first count charged defendant with a forced act of vaginal sexual intercourse and the second count was based on evidence that defendant forced the same victim to submit to anal sexual intercourse. Defendant claimed that the words &quot;unnatural sexual intercourse&quot; that were contained in the statute were unconstitutionally vague and that because of the vagueness &sect; 22, which carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, conferred an unconstitutional measure of discretion on the prosecution in deciding whether to proceed under &sect; 22 or Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect;&sect; 34 or 35, which carried lesser maximum sentences. On appeal, the held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 22 (1974) was not void for vagueness. The court reasoned that the definition of &quot;unnatural sexual intercourse&quot; under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &sect; 23 (1974) included anal intercourse and there was no evidence that the legislature intended the words to vary in meaning from section to section. The court did not address defendant's claim that the statute conferred too much charging discretion because defendant had not demonstrated any abuse of prosecutorial discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for having committed unnatural sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the Superior Court (Massachusetts), following a jury trial, for unlawfully carrying a firearm without a license in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a). The trial court denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to warrant the submission of the case to the jury. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence showed that in response to a radio call police officers went to an apartment building and observed a group of men arguing in the hallway. An officer heard defendant say &quot;it was only shooting blanks.&quot; The officer asked defendant where the gun was and was taken to defendant's room where the gun was lying on a bed. Defendant was arrested and later admitted that he had purchased the gun in New York. At the close of the Commonwealth's case, defendant made a motion for a directed verdict on the ground that there was no evidence that he had carried the firearm on his person. On appeal, the court found that the word &quot;carrying&quot; as used in Mass Gen. Laws ch. 269, &sect; 10(a) involved movement. Here, the evidence showed only &quot;temporary possession&quot; during firing and no &quot;movement&quot; at all. The only legitimate inference was that defendant had picked up the gun and held it while he fired it, but such temporary possession was not sufficient for conviction of unlawfully carrying a firearm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to a decree nisi of divorce, a wife was given custody of the parties' three minor children, and the husband was ordered to pay child support. When two of the children reached the age of 18, the husband petitioned for a reduction of the support order. All three children were still living with the wife; the eldest was 19 and unemployed, and the middle child was 18 and attending public school. The probate court entered an order reducing the husband's child support obligation to a certain amount for the support of the two younger children. The court affirmed. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 208 &sect; 28, the probate court had the authority to order child support for any child who had attained the age of 18 but who was not yet 21, who was living in the home of a parent, and who was principally dependent upon the parent for maintenance. This was true even though Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 4, &sect; 7 provided that 18 was the age of majority except as otherwise specified by law.</SPAN></P>

Further, the evidence disclosed that at the time of the letting of the contracts in question, defendants had knowledge that contracts over $ 2,000 had to be awarded through competitive bidding and that the seven contracts that were signed had proposals attached that, on the face of at least six of them, disclosed that there was in fact noncompetitive bidding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landlord received approval to increase rent under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1715z-1(f). The tenants refused to pay the increase and filed suit in federal court. The landlord filed a separate state court summary proceeding for non-payment. The tenants appealed the judgment in favor of the landlord. The reviewing court waived the bond and stayed collection of the increase pending resolution of the federal case provided that the tenants paid the base rent and deposited the rent increase in escrow. The tenants failed to make the payments and the appeal was dismissed. On appeal, the tenants claimed error in ignoring the issue of hardship. The court held that when bond on appeal was waived based on hardship, a requirement for the timely payment of base rent was not an unreasonable restriction on the tenants' right to appeal. Further, the court ruled that the lower court's failure to consider hardship as to the individual tenant's ability to pay the increase was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city filed a petition to foreclose a tax title to a parcel of land in the city. The city took the land for nonpayment of the 1969 real estate taxes assessed thereon, together with sewer and water charges and interest, under &sect; 54, by an instrument of taking recorded. Five days later the trustee paid all but $ 1 of the 1969 bill. The city added two items of expense incurred in connection with the land to the trustee's tax title account: a charge for the removal of rubbish from the land in 1969, and a charge for repairing and boarding up the house on the land after damage by fire in 1971. The land court decreed a judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court found that the entry onto the premises and inspection thereof constituted an illegal search. However, the court held that the Fourth Amendment did not require voiding the judgment. Compared with the harm which would have resulted to the city, the benefits of granting the requested relief were minimal as it appeared that city officials were unlikely to engage in such illegal conduct in the future and civil actions for damages were available to deter that conduct.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's appeal contended that the superior court improperly admitted gas bills seized during the execution of a search, pursuant to a valid warrant, of his home. The bills were admitted into evidence at trial in order to show defendant's control over the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During a surveillance of the defendant's building, police officers saw him take glassine bags from a window ledge in the basement, then go upstairs. When the officers executed their search warrant, they found glassine bags containing heroin in the basement and on a shelf in the kitchen. Defendant argued that seizure of gas bills that were found on top of a refrigerator, but which were not mentioned in the search warrant, was unauthorized by statute and was unconstitutional even if authorized by statute. On appeal, the court held that the seizure of the bills was lawful as relevant evidence. The court relied on precedent that held that the Fourth Amendment did not require a distinction between the seizure of items of evidential value only, which was &quot;mere evidence,&quot; and the seizure of contraband or of the instrumentalities or fruits of a crime. Evidence not described in the search warrant, but having a nexus with the crime under investigation could be seized at the same time as the material described. Because the gas bills were relevant to show defendant's control of the premises and heroin, they were admissible. Further, the gas bills were admissible under the plain view doctrine.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court held that the case did not involve the imposition of a criminal penalty simpliciter and that defendant had no standing to complain of such an imposition. The court concluded that the support order raised no equal protection question because it merely enforced a duty imposed on the father which was correlative to the mother's duty at common law and that neither defendant's contention that the order for support was excessive nor the denial of his motion for custody raised anything but factual issues that were not within the scope of an appeal under Mass.

Thereafter, the State filed a petition for defendant's commitment to a treatment center. The trial court found defendant to be a sexually dangerous person and committed him to a treatment center. The court concluded that the evidence did not permit a finding that the underlying incident was the result of compulsive behavior nor was there any evidence of other sexual misconduct. Further, there was no evidence of repetitive or compulsive sexual misbehavior sufficient to provide a point of departure for a finding that defendant was a sexually dangerous person. Defendant's criminal record did not indicate any sexual misconduct and there was no other evidence of any sexual misconduct except for the single underlying incident. Defendant's criminal record contained mainly convictions for drunkenness and other minor offenses, none of which were sex related. Further, the evidence of compulsive behavior was insufficient, as the convictions for assault to rape and unnatural act were not, without more, sufficient evidence of compulsive behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent consul general appealed an order from the Probate Court for the County of Worcester (Massachusetts), which denied his motion to strike the appearance of an individual and from the allowance of the latter's motion to strike the appearance of the consul general, in petitioner administrator's action for distribution of a decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The underlying petitions presented in the probate court were a petition for the allowance of the administrator's first account and the administrator's petition for distribution of the decedent's estate. The probate court denied the consul general's motion to strike the individual's appearance and allowed the individual's motion to strike. On appeal, the court set aside the order of the probate court and remanded. The court concluded that the probate judge's findings were not supported by the evidence and were plainly wrong. The court further concluded that the proper resolution of the issues involved required a trial de novo. The exaction of a fee for the largely ministerial function of transmitting distributive shares to the heirs was unconscionable judged by the well-established criteria in the commonwealth for determining what constituted a fair and reasonable charge to be made by an attorney for his services. No evidence had been introduced in behalf of the consul general to demonstrate his capacity to represent the Lithuanian heirs effectively. The consul general's right to be their representative was contingent in any event upon the absence of other authentic representation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendants were not denied their right to a speedy trial based on a 19-month delay because the trial involved a complex multidefendant criminal case and a substantial part of the delay was caused by defendants or their attorneys. Any delay attributable to the prosecution was not a deliberate attempt to hamper the defense and memory lapses by prosecution witnesses did not prejudice defendants. The denial of defendants' motion for severance was not erroneous because severance was not required based on the effect of a joint trial on the number of peremptory challenges the prosecution had and was not constitutionally mandated because of conflicting peremptory challenges exercised by other defendants. Defendants were not entitled to inspect the grand jury minutes because defendants failed to satisfy their burden of showing a particularized need that outweighed the policy of secrecy. Defendant was not entitled to a mistrial due to a coconspirator's mistrial because defendant failed to make an offer of proof that the coconspirator would not have invoked his privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 278, &sect;&sect; 33A-33G, defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Norfolk County (Massachusetts), which affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant on a complaint framed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 28A, which alleged that defendant did knowingly have in his possession certain obscene magazines with intent to sell the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 28A was unconstitutional on its face because it contained no clear standards by which obscenity could be judged. The court stated that the standards by which courts were to distinguish obscenity from what was protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States did not have to be set out on the face of a statute such as ch. 272, &sect; 28A if those standards appeared in judicial decisions which authoritatively construed the statute. The court stated that although prior decisions had often been difficult to apply in a particular case, nothing more could have been done to infuse definite and constitutional standards into a statute such as the one under which defendant was convicted. Further, the court rejected the argument that simply because defendant had the right to view obscene materials in the privacy of his own bedroom, he also had an implied right to purchase such materials and that a merchant or vendor had a correlative right to sell them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The children's service association filed a petition for custody pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 201, &sect; 5. The mother had a number of medical problems, including seizures during which she lost consciousness. The mother voluntarily placed the child with the children's service association. The probate judge found that during periods of her illness, the mother's condition constituted a threat to the child's safety. The mother first argued that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 201, &sect; 5 was unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected her argument, finding that the &quot;unfit&quot; standard had been defined with precision in the process of judicial decision making. Having no statutory definition, the word was given its ordinary significance. The court held that &quot;unfit&quot; meant unsuitable, incompetent, or not adapted for a particular use or service. The intricacies and subtleties of the parent-child relationship could not be governed by a detailed legislative standard; instead, it relied on the wisdom and experience of the probate judge. Here, the probate judge made extensive and careful findings that the mother lacked the capacity, stability, and motivation to provide appropriate maternal care.</SPAN></P>

Defendant Commonwealth contended that he was required to register if he admitted to indecent touching at the plea hearing. The court found that plaintiff was not convicted of a like violation of the laws of another state because an admission of battery, which was a necessary element of the crime of indecent assault and battery in Massachusetts, was not necessary to find plaintiff guilty of indecent assault in Florida.

The court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment and plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the equal protection claim, but granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the due process claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff permit applicants filed amended complaint against defendant town, seeking declaratory judgment that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 57, was unconstitutional because its terms were too vague and its procedures deprived plaintiffs of due process. Court denied plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion. Defendant moved to dismiss, claiming that certiorari review was impermissible because plaintiffs had not exhausted administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 57, plaintiffs were denied building or occupancy permits due to unpaid property taxes. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment that statute violated procedural due process and was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant town moved to dismiss, claiming that certiorari review was impermissible because plaintiffs had not exhausted administrative remedies pursuant to &sect; 57(d) waiver procedure. Finding &sect; 57 applied to any &quot;person, corporation or business enterprise&quot; who had &quot;neglected or refused to pay&quot; taxes or fees for twelve months or more, court declared that statute was sufficiently clear to survive plaintiffs' claim of unconstitutional vagueness. Court further held that procedural due process did not require specific statutory time deadline for issuance of licensing authority's decision under &sect; 57, which also provided property owners with adequate notice and opportunity to be heard. Finally, since &sect; 57(d) was a narrow waiver procedure available only for a limited class of applicants, plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies as a prerequisite to certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Despite declaring that defendant town's conditional use permit statute satisfied constitutional due process of law requirements and was not unconstitutionally vague, court ordered limited certiorari review because plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies given that statute's narrow waiver procedure was not a right of appeal available to all permit applicants who had been turned down by the licensing authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court on its own motion contemplated dismissal of plaintiff's claim that the state negligently damaged his wristwatch and lost a pair of his shoes while holding them when plaintiff was being held in a correctional facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a prisoner in a state correctional facility, brought a negligence action against defendant state when, after his wristwatch and shoes were placed in a long term storage facility, the watch was found to be damaged and the shoes were missing. After failure to settle the claim, the court requested memoranda from the parties addressing why the court should not dismiss the matter on de minimus grounds. The court dismissed the claim, holding that the expense of a jury trial was not justified for an action involving such a de minimus property interest, and that a negligence claim did not raise constitutional due process concerns under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, but rather a failure to exercise due care. Dismissal was not constitutionally defective because there was no fundamental unfairness and plaintiff's de minimus property interest did not trigger procedural due process protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff's claim for negligent loss by prison officials of his shoes and damaged to his wristwatch dismissed because de minimis property interest did not trigger constitutional procedural due process protection.</SPAN></P>
