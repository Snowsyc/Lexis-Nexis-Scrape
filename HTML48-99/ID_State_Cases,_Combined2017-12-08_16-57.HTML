</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the parents of a man who was killed in a car accident, appealed from a judgment of a district court (Idaho), which favored defendant, the driver of the vehicle that was involved in the single car accident that killed their son. The parents brought a wrongful death action against the driver. The dispositive issue on appeal was whether the jury should have been instructed on the applicability of the guest statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had recently held that the automobile guest statute was unconstitutional. Because that statute had been material to the negligence issues raised during the trial, the court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial on the issue of the negligence. Because the court determined that there should be a new trial, the court determined that it should address the other legal issues presented on appeal. On the issue of whether certain photographs were admissible, the court held that changes in the road that occurred between the time of the taking of the photograph and the time of the accident were adequately explained when the exhibits were offered into evidence. The court also determined that the trial court had not abused its discretion by not allowing an economist to testify at trial concerning the future earnings of the deceased because there was no relationship between the potential future earnings and the amount of money the deceased would have contributed to the support of his parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for a new trial. The court awarded attorney fees to the parents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was driving an automobile. A passenger in the automobile was injured when the vehicle went off the road. The passenger filed an action against petitioner, alleging that he was not a guest passenger.

The trial judge denied the motion for summary judgment on the ground that the guest statute was unconstitutional. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate directing the trial judge to apply the guest statute and to grant the motion for summary judgment. In denying the petition for a writ of mandate, the court found that the guest statute violated the equal protection guarantees of the Idaho and United States Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, all inmates, sexually assaulted a fellow inmate. As a result, they were convicted of committing infamous crimes against nature in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6605. Defendants, in a consolidated appeal, challenged the conviction, contending that the statute under which they were convicted was constitutionally void for vagueness. The court noted that void for vagueness simply meant that criminal responsibility should not have attached where one count not have reasonably understood that his contemplated conduct was proscribed. Here &sect; 18-6605, which had been in effect for over 50 years, reasonably notified a defendant of the criminality of the conduct proscribed. Accordingly, the court concluded that the void for vagueness argument was without merit. Defendants also argued that the sentence imposed by the trial court was erroneous. They contended that &sect; 18-6605 did not specify a maximum sentence, thus they should have been sentenced under Idaho Code &sect; 18-112. The court disagreed, however, holding that the maximum was left to the discretion of the trial court, which was not abused. Accordingly, the judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer saw defendants' truck in a remote area where there had been poaching of big game. The area contained no farms, ranches, or permanent inhabitants. The officer decided to investigate and as he approached the rear of the moving pick-up, he was able to see an object that appeared to be a large dead animal in the rear of the pick-up. He sounded his siren and the pick-up truck stopped. The officer walked to it and observed in the truck bed a part of a bull elk with horns partially covered with a blanket. Defendants were arrested and found guilty of violating the game laws by killing elk during a closed season. On appeal, the court held that following the stop of the vehicle, the officer's actions were clearly permissible under the plain-view doctrine. The court concluded that the officer's pursuit and stop of defendants' vehicle was legal and that there was probable cause for defendants' arrest and the seizure of the elk carcass.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Fourth Judicial District Court of Idaho, which affirmed her conviction for being a common prostitute on a charge of soliciting and offering to engage in lewd sexual acts for hire and engaging in an act of prostitution. Defendant argued several errors, including error in refusing to dismiss the amended complaint, an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, and a denial of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after she had allegedly performed an illicit sexual act upon an undercover officer in return for money. The complaint charged defendant with crimes of soliciting and offering to engage in lewd sexual acts for hire and with engaging in an act of prostitution; however, the district court convicted her of being a common prostitute, which was prohibited by a local city ordinance, but was not stated in the complaint. The court, noting that although defendant was not charged for the offense, she would not have been denied due process by being convicted of a charge not made if the crime of being a common prostitute was a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the complaint, stated that the lack of discrimination was an additional element not required in the proof of either of the crimes charged. Therefore, it was a denial of due process to convict defendant of a crime with which she was not charged. The court stated that defendant had not waived her right to object, despite no previous objections, because there were no defects in the complaint, rather there was a variance between the complaint and the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and dismissed the charges against her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Idaho challenged a judgment of an Idaho district court holding that Iowa Code &sect; 49-901(a) and (b) was unconstitutional because it the distinction it established between processed and unprocessed agricultural products for truck weight limits discriminated against respondent fish food company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fish food had received several traffic citations for haling its product within Iowa. The citations alleged violations of weight limits under Idaho Code &sect; 49-901(a) and (b) applicable to its product because it was not exempt from the weight limit under &sect; 49-901(c), which exempted unprocessed agricultural goods. The fish food company brought a declaratory judgment action to have the statute declared unconstitutional as violative of Idaho Const. art 1, &sect;&sect; 2 and 13 and U.S. Const. amend. 14 because it deprived it of due process of law. The district court agreed and found &sect; 49-901(a) and (b)&nbsp;unconstitutional, and made all weight limits for agricultural products subject to the higher weight limits of &sect; 49-901(c). The state sought review. The court found that the distinction was arbitrary and capricious and not reasonably related to the purpose of protecting the highways. However, the court found that &sect; 49-901(c), which created the exemptions, was unconstitutional. The court let stand the first two subsections of the statute, that established weight limits for different classes of cargoes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the district court's judgment finding that there should be no distinction between agricultural products and instead held that part of the weight limit statute unconstitutional that exempted unprocessed agricultural products form weight limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner and two others were charged with grand larceny. The charges against the petitioner were dismissed. At a probable cause hearing for the other two individuals, the petitioner refused to answer any questions concerning the alleged crime invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The petitioner was granted immunity from prosecution and ordered to testify. He continued to refuse to testify and was found in contempt. The petitioner alleged that &sect; 19-1115 denied him due process of law because it deprived him of a trial by jury on the original charge of grand larceny, and violated his constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. The court quashed the writ. At the time the petitioner was ordered to testify, all charges against him had been dropped; therefore, he was not deprived of the right to a trial by jury. The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination was not violated where immunity from prosecution was granted and the immunity granted was co-extensive with the privilege. Section 19-1115, under which the district court acted, did not infringe on the petitioner's constitutional rights and the procedures followed were correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for larceny of three calves and one cow. Defendant contended that the statutory scheme defining theft of livestock under Idaho Code &sect; 18-4604 was unconstitutional and that he should have been convicted and sentenced for petit larceny under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-4605 and 18-4607.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a sentence of five years in the penitentiary for stealing three calves and a cow. On review he contended that his conviction and sentence for grand larceny violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. In essence he argued that the classification of livestock as a factor under grand larceny bore no reasonable relation to other provisions of the larceny statute that classified crime by monetary value, with petit theft defined as property under $ 150. The court rejected the argument, finding no constitutional violation. Although a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute defining larceny of livestock and fixing punishment therefor had not been previously presented, the principle of according the legislature wide latitude in classifying crimes and degrees of evil had been upheld by the court in analogous contexts. The separate classification of larceny of livestock bore a reasonable relationship to the protection of an industry difficult to safeguard while marking a class of offenders which experience dictated as deserving special treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted by a felony information for illegal possession of marijuana, a narcotic drug. After defendant was convicted, he appealed. On appeal the court held that a police officer's observation of marijuana plants in defendant's back yard was not an illegal and unconstitutional invasion of defendant's right to privacy. The court found that enclosing the plants in a waist high picket fence with intermittent vegetation was not an action that was reasonably calculated to keep the plants from observation. The court stated that the discovery of evidence that was in plain view did not have to be inadvertent before it could be seized and used as competent evidence. The court determined that the general search of defendant's house was not an illegal search. Officers made a search of the house looking for defendant. The court noted that during a lawful search of premises for persons believed to be in hiding, police officers may seize contraband evidence in plain sight. The court concluded that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant's motion to have the charge tried as a misdemeanor rather than a felony, but that such error did not require a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman worked for 25 years for a city. Months prior to his retirement, he was injured while on duty. As a result of these injuries, a claim was filed for workmen's compensation benefits, which were granted. When he retired several months later pursuant to Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 72-1411 and 72-1429B, he filed a claim for his pension, which was granted. Agreements were executed reflecting the benefits. He was then advised that his workmen's compensation benefits would have to be deducted from his firemen's retirement benefits pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 72-1429P. He filed a petition for hearing with the Commission, alleging that he was entitled to full payment under both agreements. The Commission found that the deduction was proper. On appeal, the fireman asserted that &sect; 72-1429P was unconstitutional because it discriminated against firemen and that it was error to not hold both agreements payable in full. The court held that &sect; 72-1429P was constitutional because it had a fair and substantial relationship to the objects of the workmen's compensation and fireman's pension statutes. It also held that the fireman was not entitled to duplicate benefits for only one wage-loss.</SPAN></P>

After respondent District Court of the Seventh Judicial District, in and For the County of Freemont (Idaho), denied petitioners' motion to dismiss the action, they sought an alternative writ of review and an alternative writ of prohibition against respondents, district court and judge, under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 7-202, 7-401, 7-402.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, the widow's husband, was 20 years old at the time of the accident and a minor under Idaho Code &sect; 32-101. In the wrongful death action against petitioners, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners argued that under the wrongful death statutes in effect at the time of the accident, specifically Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 5-310, 5-311 (amended 1972), there was no cause of action by a widow or child of a deceased minor. The court then quashed petitioners' request for an alternative writ, denied the writ of prohibition, and dismissed the petition filed against respondents. All three statutes were amended after the accident and provided relief in such a situation. The court ruled that the former minority statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 32-101, which provided different ages of majority for men and women, violated the Equal Protection Clause and was unconstitutional. At the time of his death, the decedent, who was over 18, was considered to have reached the age of majority. Accordingly, the statute that applied was the former version of Idaho Code &sect; 5-311 and the benefits of that statute were extended to those here who were formerly excluded.</SPAN></P>

The claimant assigned error alleging that the actual nature of the injury did not become cognizable until 1971; the employer's agent misled claimant by telling him no claim could be filed unless he was disabled for two weeks; barring a claim before the injury became known to the employee was contrary to the Idaho Constitution. The court, noting that the claimant did not file a notice of injury and claim for compensation until 1971, stated that the action was barred by the four-year statute of limitations, under Idaho Code &sect; 72-407, where the accident occurred 1964 and the four-year period began to run from the date of the accident, not from the date of the injury. The court, rejecting the claimant's assertion that denying his claim was unconstitutional under Idaho Const. art.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty and also found him guilty as a persistent violator. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Under the facts of this case, the crime of receiving money or property under false personation, Idaho Code &sect; 18-3002, was an included offense in the crime of false and fraudulent use of a credit card in violation of Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-3113 and 18-3119. Defendant's use of the credit card without authority was accomplished by falsely personating and assuming the character of the card's owner. Thus, the trial court committed reversible error in its refusal to instruct the jury on the included offense. The court also held, inter alia, that defendant was properly charged in one count even though the acts occurred on two separate occasions, as the two transactions together constituted one felony. The court held that &sect; 18-3119 was constitutional, as it had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state maintained property as a home for veterans. When a new veterans' home was constructed, the former site was abandoned, and the legislature declared the property to be surplus and to be held as general property of the state. Several years later, the city and county successfully brought suit to condemn a portion of the property for the construction of a roadway. Subsequently, the state legislature enacted Idaho Session Laws 1971, ch.125, which created a state park at the site. The state thereafter instituted suit against the city and the county to condemn and reacquire the property. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the county and the city, after concluding that the legislation at issue was a special law, which was prohibited by the state constitution. The state appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 19, par. 7, did not prohibit the legislature from establishing state parks on lands owned by the state. Further, Idaho Sessions Laws 1971, ch. 125, while in fact special legislation, did not come within those categories of special legislation specifically prohibited by Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 19, par. 7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A criminal complaint charged defendant with statutory rape. An amended complaint was issued charging him with two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. Defendant was advised of his constitutional rights when arrested and the following morning. He then made a statement that was admitted at trial. Defendant waived the preliminary examination and then made a demand for a preliminary examination, motion to suppress evidence, and a motion to dismiss, among others, which were denied. He was convicted and appealed. In affirming, the court found that the information met the requirements of Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 19-1409, 19-1411, adequately informing him of the act and nature of the charge. Defendant was given an opportunity for a preliminary hearing which he waived, after which an information alleging the same counts and crime was filed. Defendant's claim that the crime involved required corroboration and that no such corroboration was present was without merit, as sufficient corroboration could be found in defendant's confession. Because there was direct evidence of defendant's knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of rights before he made a statement, the State's burden had been met.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants determined that there was a scarcity of water in a river and shut off the user's diversion of water from a creek that was a secondary tributary of the river. Defendant sued and, during the proceedings, Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 42-605 and 42-607 were amended by 1969 Idaho Sess. Laws 305 (1969 amendment). The trial court granted summary judgment to the user based on the amendment. On appeal, the court held that although the pre-1969 amendment version of Idaho Code &sect; 42-607 gave preference to adjudicated over unadjudicated water rights and thus allowed the watermaster to shut off the user's diversion of water from the creek, the 1969 amendments made no reference to unadjudicated water rights and thus eliminated any preference for adjudicated water rights. Because the amended Idaho Code &sect; 42-605 did not include constitutional use rights in its definition of water rights, the watermaster had no authority or jurisdiction over such rights, regardless of scarcity. Thus the watermaster could not shut off the user's diversion of creed waters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The construction company, which did not have a collective bargaining agreement with any labor organization, contracted with the State of Idaho to construct portions of an interstate highway, under which it was to pay minimum wages as set by the U.S. Secretary of Labor. A representative of the union locals began picketing the company's project site as to wages and benefits, and the trial court found that the picketing had an unlawful objective in light of the 90-day wage freeze imposed by 36 Fed. Reg. 18,739 on federal contracts. On review, the court held that, although Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 44-703, 44-712 did not prohibit the enjoining of picketing to publicize a dispute between an employer and union members who were not his employees, U.S. Const. amend. XIV did. Any picketing to obtain the payment, during the 90-day freeze, of wages at a rate higher than paid at the base period of the company's contract was specifically proscribed by 36 Fed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were the shareholders of a corporation that owned and operated a motel complex. When the taxpayers sold the complex to another corporation, the Commission assessed it for failing to collect or pay over sales tax on the sale of the personal property sold as operating assets of the complex. The issue before the court was whether the Act as it existed at the time of the taxpayers' assessment unconstitutionally denied them equal protection of the law because the Act required &quot;retailers,&quot; such as the motel complex, to pay sales tax on sales of personal property when sold as operating assets of a going business but did not require &quot;non-retailers&quot; to pay sales tax on similar sales. The court reversed the decision and remanded the cause, opining that the distinction between occasional sales by retailers and occasional sales by non-retailers as contained in the Idaho Sales Tax Act of 1965 was reasonably related to the public purpose of securing compliance with the Act and, therefore, did not deny the taxpayers equal protection of the laws. The court noted that those portions of the Act deemed constitutionally offensive by the lower court had been changed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellant Idaho Department of Public Assistance (DPA) sought review of judgments from a district court (Idaho), which found that respondent nursing home residents were medically needy persons under Idaho Code &sect; 56-209b, which reversed the decisions from DPA hearing officers denying the residents Medicaid benefits, and which ordered the DPA to reinstate the residents' benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DPA terminated the residents' benefits when Congress raised their Social Security payments so that the residents' income was just above the DPA's Medicaid eligibility limit for categorically needy persons. The hearing officer upheld the termination, but the district court reversed. On appeal, the court held that Idaho, by enacting Idaho Code &sect; 56-209b, exercised its option under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(10) to include medically needy persons as well as categorically needy persons in Idaho's Medicaid plan. Thus, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(17), 45 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 248.21, and Idaho Code 56-203(g), the DPA had to use a flexible measurement of available income in determining whether the residents' financial resources did not meet their needs for necessary medical and remedial care and services as required by 45 C.F.R. &sect; 248.10(a)(2). Because the residents were elderly and had insufficient income to afford the cost of nursing home services, and because nursing home care was essential to the bedridden residents, the residents were medically needy and entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court issued an alternative writ of mandate, requiring defendants to pay the monies, and then held a hearing with respect to whether the alternative writ should be made permanent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As required by the public health district law, specifically Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 39-423 and 39-424, the chairmen of each of the counties within the public health district created a budget and held a public hearing. The only dissenting vote belonged to the county represented by defendants and, as such, defendants refused to contribute its portion of the budget, which caused the public health district to seek a writ of mandate. The court ordered the alternative writ to be made permanent, concluding that the public health district did not have a speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law as noted in Idaho Code &sect; 7-303. Although defendants argued that the legislature violated the doctrine of the separation of powers contained in Idaho Const. art. 2, &sect; 1 because the legislature intruded upon the taxation function of county government in its enactment of the public health district law, the court found no conflict between the public health district law and the Idaho Constitution. Similarly, the court found that the public health district law was not a special law in violation of Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 19 because the law applied equally to all counties within the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Negotiations between the city and the corporation for the purchase of the property were unsuccessful and the city filed an action in condemnation to acquire the property of the corporation. The trial court gave judgment of condemnation in favor of the city but found one clause of the Idaho Urban Renewal Law of 1965 (Act), Idaho Code &sect; 50-2001 et seq. to be unconstitutional. The corporation appealed from the judgment of condemnation and the city cross-appealed from the finding of the trial court of partial unconstitutionality of the Act. The corporation contended that the trial court erred in holding that their property was being taken for a public use and that such taking was prohibited by the Idaho Constitution, Idaho Const. Art I, &sect; 13 and the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court rejected this argument, finding the corporation did not show the purpose of the urban renewal plan was designed to benefit private interests, rather than the public. The court also found, contrary to the lower court, that a portion of the Act was not in conflict with the Idaho constitution, and reversed that part of the holding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The loan was made under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 42-1754(b), 42-1756(a). Section 42-1754(b) stated that subject loans could be made to irrigation districts, canal and irrigation companies, water users' associations, municipal and private corporations, and in special cases where approved by the Board to persons to finance project costs. The district court deleted the special cases' language from the statutes as unconstitutionally permitting an unequal handling of individual loan applicants. The court ruled that the deletion was an error. It found that all the members of the individual class had an equal opportunity to prove that they were special cases. Statutes that gave equal opportunity to all those that belonged to the same class were not constitutionally prohibited special laws. Also, the court held that the special cases' language was not void for vagueness under Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 17. The court pointed out that the criteria for granting loans were provided by Idaho Code &sect; 42-1756 and that the special cases' language was a legislatively stated preference for the other statutorily listed entities. The court also held that the statutes did not violate Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed in an automobile collision. Her children filed suit against the negligent driver. When the driver succumbed during the pendency of the suit, the case proceeded against her estate. The matter proceeded to trial, the jury found in favor of the decedent's children, and judgment was rendered in their favor after the trial court reduced the jury award to $ 10,000 under the damage limitation provision of Idaho Code &sect; 5-327. The decedent's children appealed, contending that the statute violated their equal protection rights. In affirming, the court concluded that the statute did not violate equal protection rights. Prior to the passage of Idaho Code &sect; 5-327, a claim against a tortfeasor abated upon the tortfeasor's death. Idaho Code &sect; 5-327 extinguished the common law rule of abatement upon the tortfeasor's death and extended protection previously nonexistent to tort victims and their heirs. The damage limitation provision established a balance by protecting the legitimate expectancy interests of the tortfeasor's innocent heirs and shielded the estate from depletion by a personal injury claim exceeding $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the classifications of Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 23-903, 23-948 were unconstitutional in that they violated defendants' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants asserted that the facts alleged in the respective informations could not constitute a public offense because the liquor licensing scheme embodied in the Idaho Code created a classification that violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Defendants explained that they had not applied for licenses because the locations of their businesses placed them outside a municipality and not within any of the enumerated exceptions to the municipality requirement that were listed in Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 23-903, 23-948. The court reversed the judgment of dismissal and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court found that some discrimination was inherent in any legislative attempt to limit the number of retail outlets for liquor by the drink, but that a mere showing of discrimination was insufficient to defeat the regulatory scheme. The court held that the discriminatory classification reflected a reasonably conceivable, legitimate public purpose. Further, the court held that the four-part classification of &sect;&sect; 23-903, 23-948 was reasonably related to the legitimate public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought suit for wrongful death. On amended pleadings, plaintiff named the state as a defendant. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant state, and entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the return of the jury verdict. On review, the court determined that the interest of a public body in relying upon the existing state of the law must be protected and therefore, the order of summary judgment was not error even though the defense of sovereign immunity had been previously abolished by the court. The court held that there were issues of fact to be determined with regard to contributory negligence, and it was error for the trial court to substitute its judgment for that of the jury. The court further held that attorney's fees could not be ordered until after the case had been concluded. The case was remanded for proceedings in accordance with the decision.</SPAN></P>

The court opined that the cause was not moot because disabilities flowed from the challenged conviction. However, at the time that petitioner was arrested the committing magistrate was not authorized to appoint counsel to represent him. As the magistrate advised petitioner, it was necessary for him to waive the preliminary hearing and then to request counsel in the district court. The court rejected petitioner's claim that he was not advised of his right to appeal because there was no constitutional right to appeal. The court noted that the remainder of petitioner's claims related to errors that occurred at his trial. Thus, he complained of the denial of a continuance, the admission of his juvenile conviction, and the denial of an instruction. The court held that those were proper matters to raise on an appeal and that post-conviction proceedings were not a substitute for an appeal.</SPAN></P>

Section &sect; 33-1501 required the superintendent to allocate state funds for the purpose of transportation of the parochial students.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents brought a class action seeking a declaratory judgment upholding the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 33-1501, after the superintendent refused to allocate state funds as provided in the statute. The superintendent claimed that the statute violated Idaho Const. Art. 9, &sect; 5 because it provided for the expenditure of tax dollars in aid of a religious purpose. The court agreed. In so ruling, the court noted that Idaho's constitutional provision regarding the separation of church and state was more restrictive than the First Amendment of the federal constitution. Under the Idaho provision, the court was required to focus on whether the statute was in &quot;aid of any church&quot; or whether it was &quot;to help support or sustain&quot; any church-affiliated school. Because the statute assisted the students to attend parochial schools and aided such schools by bringing the children to them, the statute violated Idaho Const. Art. 9, &sect; 5. Further, the statute did not violate the federal guarantee of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

The company initiated an action in district court for the purpose of determining the constitutional validity of the statute. The trial court found that the law violated the due process of law under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed, holding that the statute, as applied to the company's product, deprived the company of its property without due process of law. The product was in no way harmful or injurious to health. The prohibition of the manufacture and sale of a nutritious food product that was harmless to public health could not be justified under the police power because the remedy had no reasonable relationship to the purpose.

On the way to the station, defendant stated &quot;have you ever seen my 12-gauge shotgun? For this, I am going to kill your (expletive deleted).&quot; Public officers meant officers of the judicial, legislative, or executive branch, and interference with such an officer's performance of a duty was a felony or a misdemeanor depending on the interference. Under &sect; 18-2703, a threat or violence to deter any executive officer was a felony. The court ruled that it appeared that defendant's conduct in threatening the officer was covered by &sect; 18-2703. The court rejected defendant's contention that the officer lost the right to arrest him for a misdemeanor under Idaho Code &sect; 19-603(1) by waiting until after he moved to the second bar; arrests without warrants for misdemeanors made within a prompt, reasonable time after the respective offenses were valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Thereafter, the probate court suspended the sentence and placed him on probation. The State sought review, pursuant to &sect; 49-1102(d), which provided a mandatory minimum 10-day jail sentence upon a conviction. The trial court found no error, and the court agreed with its findings. The court held that the authority possessed by the courts to sentence necessarily included the power to suspend the whole or any part of that sentence. Because a judge was more than just a finder of fact or an executioner of the inexorable rule of law, courts were given discretion in sentencing, even in the most serious felony cases. As &sect; 49-1102(d) provided for no exceptions to jail time, the court found that it abrogated the power of the court to suspend sentence when the circumstances and good conscience justified such action, and it removed any authority to impose a lighter sentence. Therefore, the court held that the portion of &sect; 49-1102(d), which provided for mandatory jail time, was unconstitutional, null, void, and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the trial court's findings and overturned the decision. The statute provided for a judicial determination of whether the patient was mentally ill, then commitment to the state hospital. Yet, safeguards were in place to allow for further evaluation by the probate court and for the patient to seek habeas corpus relief with the district court. The patient was afforded right to counsel, right to be present, the right to present evidence and examine witnesses, with right to appeal from the determination by the court.

On appeal, the court reversed the summary judgment for respondents, the denial of the petition for a permanent writ of mandate compelling respondents to reinstate the student, and the dismissal of the petition. The court held that under Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 21, and the Ninth Amendment of the United States Constitution made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, the student's right to wear his hair in a manner of his choice was a protected right of personal taste not to be interfered with by the state unless the state could meet the &quot;substantial burden&quot; criteria. Respondents failed to establish the &quot;substantial burden of justification&quot; essential to sustain the validity of the regulation.

The court concluded that Senate Joint Resolution 122 proposed a massive and radical change in the constitution and there could be no basis for characterizing the changes as mere amendments. Nowhere in Idaho Const. art. 3, wherein the powers of the legislature are limited, was there any specific limitation on the legislature as respects amendment or revision of the constitution. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of the secretary. The legislature had by express resolution deemed the calling of a constitutional convention unnecessary.

The lease fell under the general rule that a municipality could lease its property to a private concern when the lease did not conflict with the public's use or need of the property and the provisions of the constitution prohibiting the county from lending its credit in aid of private enterprises were not violated by the lease.

No warrant for the search was obtained, defendants were not present, and their consent had not been given. In the vehicle, officers found two paper sacks containing marijuana. At trial, the tobacco can and the paper sacks were admitted into evidence over defendants' objections. Defendants were convicted, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the search of the vehicle did not violate defendants' rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The officers had knowledge prior to the search that the defendants had been in possession of narcotics while in the automobile. Defendants were held on charges closely related to the reason for which the search of the vehicle was conducted. Furthermore, the search was substantially contemporaneous with the arrest.</SPAN></P>

The applicant had purchased the permit of a bankrupt carrier from the trustee in bankruptcy and had filed an application for transfer of the permit. The Commission had requested additional information under Idaho Code &sect; 61-809.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was advised by the Commission to provide information regarding the past operations of the bankrupt carrier: they had purchased the permit from the trustee. The Commission contended that the permit might be subject to restriction under &sect; 61-809 because the bankrupt carrier had intentionally failed to furnish services authorized by the permit. At the hearing, the trustee and attorney for the bankrupt carrier testified, but no person with direct knowledge of the carrier's activities was produced as a witness. The Commission denied the permit transfer because the applicant had not provided sufficient information. The court rejected the applicant's contention that application of &sect; 61-809 retroactively was improper, holding that the bankrupt carrier's consideration for its permit was the agreement to provide the certificated services, and, therefore, absent compliance, retroactive application did not impair the obligation of a contract between the carrier and the State. Remedial action by the Commission was authorized and under Idaho Code &sect; 61-809 because restriction of the transferability of the permit was a valid police power of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Idaho appealed an order of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which held that Idaho Code &sect; 49-761A, requiring motorcycle operators to wear a safety helmet, was an unconstitutional violation of due process and which dismissed defendant's conviction for violating &sect; 49-761A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a justice court of violating &sect; 49-761A for operating his motorcycle without a safety helmet. He appealed his conviction, asserting that the statute was unconstitutional. The district court reversed the conviction upon finding that the statute violated substantive due process. On appeal, the State asserted that &sect; 49-761A was a valid exercise of the State's police power because it bore a reasonable relationship to the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. Defendant asserted that the statute violated his right to privacy under the Federal Constitution and that the statute was not designed to protect the general public. The court found that the operation of a motorcycle on the public highway without a helmet was dangerous and had resulted in a dramatic increase in death and serious injury that could have been avoided by the use of helmets. It held that the statute benefited the general public and not just individual operators because the use of a helmet reduced the possibility of a motorcycle operator losing control and endangering others and reduced the need and cost of the use of emergency personnel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants collected fees for licensing vehicles during November 1969 and remitted all of these fees to the state treasurer with the exception of $ 7,281.00, which defendants refused to remit and claimed was a charge for costs of collection and administration of registration of motor vehicles. Defendants excused their neglect and refusal to remit these funds on the theory that Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 17 conflicted with Idaho Code &sect; 40-2211 and specifically authorized the deduction of the costs of collection from the receipts gained from the licensing of motor vehicles. However, the court held that the plain meaning of Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 17 was that all moneys collected from the enumerated sources had to be used for the designated purpose and could not be diverted therefrom. Although the legislature could provide for the deduction of costs of collection from such moneys prior to the time they were deposited in the state highway fund, it had failed to do so. Because defendants failed to sustain their burden of clearly showing the unconstitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 40-2211, the court had to hold that the legislation was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment from the trial court (Idaho), which entered a verdict in favor of respondent property owner after holding that a city zoning ordinance precluding the erection of a gas station on a busy intersection was confiscatory, arbitrary, unreasonable and void. As a result, the property owner was entitled to erect the gas station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court enjoined the city from bringing any civil or criminal action against the property owner or its successors arising out of the use of the subject property. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court invalidating the ordinance, permitting the property owner to erect a gas station, and enjoining the city from bringing an action against the property owner or its successors. The court held that although the city had a right to enact zoning ordinances, such an ordinance had to bear a reasonable relationship to the goal or ends sought to be attained. In the instant situation, the evidence showed that the property in question was situated between two thoroughfares, that a traffic signal was installed because of the increase in traffic flow, and that no residences had been built on either arterial. According to the court, that was sufficient to show that the ordinance was arbitrary and confiscatory because the traffic volume and commercial character of the area had a definite bearing on the validity of the ordinance. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The qualified electors contended the two-thirds majority requirement gave each negative voter greater voting power than an affirmative voter, therefore, the two-thirds majority requirement debased the vote of an affirmative voter and was offensive to the principle of &quot;one man, one vote.&quot; The court held that the two-thirds assent requirement was not offensive to the Equal Protective Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and reversed the grant of the qualified electors' petition for a writ of mandate. The court found that not anywhere in the caselaw was there even a hint that Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 and Idaho Code &sect; 50-1026, which allegedly &quot;debased&quot; the vote of the qualified electors, were offensive to the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. The court did not believe that the theory of &quot;one man, one vote,&quot; as discovered in the Equal Protection Clause, militated against and prohibited the continuation of a political theory which laid at the foundation of the American government, which, simply stated, was a consensus amounting to more than a simple majority was not only desirable but necessary at certain times and in certain circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Determining that both were equally entitled to letters of administration, the probate court awarded the letters to the father because &sect; 15-314 required that in cases where more than one applicant was qualified, males were preferred over females. The trial court reversed the probate court, and the court reversed the trial court. The court held that although the equal protection clause prohibited distinctions between classification based on arbitrary and capricious standards, &sect; 15-314 had a rational basis. The court held that the statute was not designed to discriminate, but was only designed to efficiently administer decedents' estates. The legislature had concluded that in general men were better qualified to act as administrators than women. The court held that the classification was not so completely without a basis in fact as to be irrational and arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a parent and a taxpayer, sought a writ of prohibition to prohibit and restrain defendant Trustees and Clerk of School District No. 139, Canyon County, Idaho from selling general obligation school bonds that were approved in an election. Plaintiffs claimed that the election was invalid because Idaho Code &sect; 33-404, which limited the franchise to voters who were real property taxpayers in the district, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought the writ under Idaho Code &sect; 7-401. The court held that a writ of prohibition was a proper remedy to challenge Idaho Code &sect; 33-404. The court permitted the School District to waive the 40-day limitation on the action set out in Idaho Code &sect; 34-2001A, without deciding that it was applicable, due to the great public interest in the result of the litigation. The court was concerned solely with the validity of the real property taxpayer requirement in a school election held on a proposal to incur indebtedness. In the court's view, the School District's discrimination between property owners and non-property owners pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 33-404 was not per se a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court opined that the key question was whether the excluded class was as substantially affected by the election as the included class. The court held that real property taxpayers had an interest in the outcome of the election substantially greater than other electors who were not also taxpayers on real property. Further, Idaho had authorized the distinction in Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 20 since 1890.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed its alternative writ, denied the writ of prohibition, and dismissed plaintiffs' petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a first trial. That conviction was reversed because the trial judge denied defendant's motion to recuse pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 1-1801. Prior to retrial defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted and then quashed after a hearing. The judge who heard the habeas corpus matter also presided over the retrial. Defendant also filed a motion under Idaho Code &sect; 1-1801 to recuse the second judge, which was denied. The court held that defendant could not obtain the second judge's recusal because the habeas corpus proceeding was independent of the criminal action and was not a contested matter under the statute. Further, the new trial was not a new proceeding, and defendant was limited the recusal of only one judge in the same action or proceeding. Because defendant was able to conduct adequate voir dire and there was no unusual difficulty selecting the jury, defendant did not demonstrate prejudice necessary to warrant a change of venue under Idaho Code &sect; 19-1801.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer sued a corporation and a county's board of commissioners seeking to invalidate a lease of county land to the corporation, and the trial court entered judgment declaring, in the first paragraph, that the lease was void and, in the second paragraph, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine if there were a criminal violation. The corporation and the board filed motions under Idaho R. Civ. P. 59(e) to delete the second paragraph and perfected appeals from the first paragraph. Thereafter the trial court issued an ejectment order, and the corporation sought a writ of prohibition. The court held that because the motions to delete the second paragraph of the judgment did not affect the parties' rights or liabilities, the appeals were not premature under Idaho Code &sect; 13-201. Because the judgment merely declared the lease invalid, the appeals automatically stayed the trial court's proceedings under Idaho Code &sect; 13-211 without the need for a supersedeas bond, and the trial court had no further jurisdiction. Because the corporation would lose money from its racetrack if the ejectment order were given effect, the corporation was entitled to a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the board retroactively applied Idaho Code &sect; 72-1209 to him. The supreme court reversed, holding that application of a law in effect at the time the disability occurred to a claim arising from that disability did not involve a retroactive application of the law.

A hearing was held and the suspension was ordered. The driver forfeited a bond he had posted in police court on the original charge. The Commissioner entered another order further suspending the driver's license based on the forfeiture of the bond. After the trial court held that Idaho Code &sect; 49-330(b) was unconstitutional, the Commissioner appealed. The court held that &sect; 49-330 was a valid, enforceable law. However, the court determined that the suspension of the license because of the forfeiture of the bond was invalid. The relating of a bond forfeiture to conviction only had reference to a determination of &quot;violation point counts.&quot; The statute was not unconstitutional, but because the Commissioner erred in suspending the license, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fund at issue formed a part of the public school fund and the school official was charged with and concerned with the administration of the school fund assets.

The court held that the loaning of endowment fund assets envisioned by the amendment to Idaho Const. art. 9, &sect; 11, and S.B. 1277 constituted neither a lending of credit nor a lending of credit in aid of private associations, and thus, the court concluded that no conflict between those provisions and the credit clause of Idaho Const. art. 8, &sect; 2 existed. The court gave full effect to Idaho Const. art. 9, &sect; 3, so that the fund would not in any manner be subject to depletion of principal or interest. The court held that the fund was permanently prohibited and restrained from commingling the permanent school endowment fund with any other fund or distributing the income from the permanent school endowment fund investments to any other fund, as provided to be done in &sect; 11 of S.B. 1277.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that the ordinance was void because the annexation, which the ordinance authorized, did not comply with the provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 50-303.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the facts amply justified the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The court noted that the property owners were aware of the pendency of the ordinance, knew that their properties were to be included in the annexation, and discussed the matter with Village authorities but did not, at any time, formally protest the annexation of their properties. The court also noted that more than two years had elapsed from the time of the enactment of the ordinance to the time of the filing of the instant action, that the Village would suffer injury and prejudice if relief were to be afforded to the property owners, and that the property owners' properties were benefitted by the annexation through the increased value of the properties and the elimination of sewage conditions, which were hazardous to health.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers raised 41 specifications of error on appeal. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the law was constitutional, holding (1) that Idaho Const. art.

The court could not say that the jury was not warranted in finding defendant guilty of reckless driving under the statute which prohibited traveling at a speed or in a manner to endanger or likely to endanger persons or property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed suit against the city and city officials, seeking a writ of mandamus, and declaratory and injunctive relief to compel issuance of the permit for either a service station or drive-in restaurant. The tract of land in dispute had been annexed by the city, but was unzoned. The city council passed two ordinances which amended zoning, and refused the building permit. The trial court held that the ordinances were valid exercises of police power, and the corporation's proposed uses were not an integrated part of an adjoining shopping center, a required prerequisite under the ordinances. On review, the court reversed judgment in favor of the corporation and held that the county ordinance, could no longer apply to the land once it was annexed to the city. Therefore, a service station was a permissible use on unzoned land, and the city officials had to issue the building permit so long as the corporation complied with all existing requirements. The court held that the proposed drive-in restaurant was prohibited by one of the city ordinances because the request for the permit was made after the ordinance, which prohibited the specific use, had been enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of Idaho Code &sect; 34-104. He filed a demurrer, which resulted in dismissal of the charge by the district court, which found that &sect; 34-104 violated the due process guarantees of the federal and state constitutions in that it was unduly vague and made many innocent acts a crime and that it violated freedom of speech and press of the United States Constitution. The State excepted to each finding. In affirming, the court held that under &sect; 34-104, it could not be determined whether the one who offended the statute was the one who ordered the material, the one who produced the material, the one who distributed the material, or whether he had to commit all three acts. The court found that &sect; 34-104 was subject to varying and conflicting constructions and held it to be invalid as void for vagueness, without mention of constitutional due process guarantees. It was clear that &sect; 34-104 was too vague to stand as a permissible restriction on the free exercise of speech and press. Section 34-104 did not make clear what conduct was subject to sanctions and had an even greater failing in that it did not clearly indicate who was subject to its sanctions.</SPAN></P>

XII, &sect; 4. The court noted that Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 limited the extent to which a city could incur any indebtedness or liability. The court found that the city had incurred a liability within the scope of &sect; 3. The court further found that the Act fell within the exception provided by &sect; 3 for &quot;ordinary and necessary expenses&quot; because the weekly or monthly compensation of municipal employees constituted such an expense. The court noted that the employees' rights were vested and therefore that the pension plan was compensatory in nature. The court concluded that the Act did not violate Idaho Const. art.

One such argument was that the permit application of the predecessor was defective because it did not contain any financial or other information regarding the incorporation or amount of stock of the applicant as required by Idaho Code &sect; 42-202. The court rejected the argument. The court relied on a number of facts and principles in rejecting the argument, including the fact that no timely objection to the application was filed under Idaho Code &sect; 42-203; principles of equity militated against the requested relief, which request was made 11 years after original approval of the application and after expenditure of money by the company on the basis of the permit.

The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that &sect; 18-2505 was unconstitutional.

The court noted that the legislature had great latitude in the exercise of its power to define crime and fix punishment and that the legislature's authority was not denied except in cases where the classifications were unnatural, arbitrary, or unreasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed purchasing gasoline in a milk container. He was seen carrying a container, stopping at the front door of a house, and then going to the rear door. Later, he was observed throwing a match at the front door of the house. A fire burned at both doors of the house. In the court's view, the verdict was not contrary to the law and evidence. Defendant claimed that the information charged the crimes of arson and of persistent violator but that he was not afforded a preliminary examination on the persistent violator charge. The court held that the persistent violator law did not create an independent crime. Thus, the trial court properly held that defendant was not entitled to a preliminary hearing on the charge and that the information was not defective. The court opined that, because the persistent violator law merely increased the penalty for a conviction on a subsequent crime, it was not an ex post facto law in violation of Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court held that questions to defendant on cross-examination to impeach him by his prior convictions were proper.

The district court entered an order sustaining the demurrer, motion to dismiss, and a motion to quash and set aside the information. In reversing, the court found that a statute couched in general terms prohibiting some form of criminally negligent misconduct was sufficient to apprise operators of motor vehicles of the conduct prohibited. Thus, the court so held with regard to that portion of &sect; 18-4006 dealing with the operation of any firearm or deadly weapon. The court determined that the phrase in &sect; 18-4006, &quot;without due caution and circumspection,&quot; meant gross negligence such as amounted to reckless disregard of consequences and the rights of others. The terms in &sect; 18-4006 were all well recognized not only in legal parlance, but also in the minds of the average citizen.

The trial court required defendants to issue a license to the property owners upon payment of the requisite fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' inn was licensed for the retail sale of beer by the county and was operated by them continuously until they sold it under a sale and purchase contract. Their vendee obtained a beer license from the county. However, he defaulted under his contract, making it necessary for the property owners to repossess the inn. The county approved their application for a license for the retail sale of beer, to be delivered upon issuance of a beer license by the village. The village denied their application without stating any grounds. Three weeks later, the village enacted an ordinance allowing the licensing within the village of only two premises for the retail sale of beer. On appeal of a judgment declaring the ordinance invalid as applied to the property owners, the court affirmed. The trial court properly determined that the property owners had an existing business, the continuation of which was prohibited by the ordinance. The effect of the ordinance was to deprive them from operating a lawful business that they or their vendee had operated for over 20 years. The ordinance operated not only retroactively, but in an unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory manner.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied his motion and, upon judicially noticing its own records, adjudged the father in contempt of court. On appeal, the court reversed holding that the mere allegation that the father appeared in the action giving rise to the order was insufficient to charge actual knowledge of the child support order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of review of defendant district court's order adjudging plaintiff guilty of contempt of court for violating a judgment prohibiting him, his agents, and his employees from taking impressions of the mouth or within the mouth for the purpose of relining dentures or making new dentures or molds for new dentures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contempt proceedings were initiated by an affidavit charging that plaintiff violated the judgment. The trial court found that a witness went to plaintiff's place of business for the purpose of having his dentures relined or new dentures made; that plaintiff suggested that the old dentures were not worth relining; that with the witness's presence, aid, assistance, and cooperation, plaintiff supervised and instructed the witness in the taking of impressions for the purpose of making new dentures; and that in doing so, plaintiff replaced the lower denture in the witness's mouth, put his fingers in the witness's mouth, and wiggled both plates. The sole question for determination on a writ of review was whether the inferior tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction. However, the trial court had jurisdiction of plaintiff by reason of his appearance pursuant to an order to show cause, and it also had jurisdiction of the subject matter, which involved the issue of whether plaintiff had violated a provision of the judgment entered in a case wherein he was a party. Finally, the court held that the facts sustained the trial court's findings reflecting a violation of the previous judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged that the trial court erred in (1) upholding the validity of the election held by the city under which it was ruled that the city changed its status from that of a special charter city to one governed under the municipal laws of the State for cities of the first class; and (2) in finding that where the government of the city was validly changed the provisions for initiative legislation in the city charter did not continue in force. They contended that the election was invalid because a majority of the electors in the city did not vote for the change as, they maintained, was required under the provisions of Idaho Const. art. XII, &sect; 1. The court held that a majority of electors voting on the proposition of organizing the city under the general municipal laws voted in favor of the proposition, such organization was validly adopted. Further, Idaho Code &sect;50-902 did not provide for cities changing from organization under special charters to organization under the general municipal laws.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city reestablished a zoning plan, which categorized properties into six basic classes. The A zone was the most strictly circumscribed. The city contended that the property owners' land, because it was never specifically zoned by the city's officials, fell into A zone. The property owners argued that until it was positively zoned, their property had to remain unzoned. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting judgment for the property owners. The court held that a judgment in a prior suit between the parties did not bar the property owners from raising the zoning issue, because the prior suit involved the enforcement of an ordinance and the current suit did not involve the ordinance. The court held that Boise City Code &sect; 11-3-1 (1965) did not restrict the uses of real property annexed to the city after its enactment, unless the city positively otherwise zoned the property. The court held that zoning restrictions that limited the right to use private property so as to realize its highest utility could not be extended by implication to cases not clearly within their scope and purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment from the District Court in and for Nez Perce County (Idaho), convicted them of gathering for unlawful purposes under City of Lewiston, Nez Perce County, Idaho, Code of Ordinances &sect; 22-31 (ordinance). Defendants alleged that the evidence was insufficient, the trial court improperly took judicial notice of the &sect; 22-31, and that &sect; 22-31 violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were in one car, chased the complaining witnesses, who were in another car, from the state of Washington into a city in Idaho, alighted from their car and threatened the complaining witnesses with assault and battery when the witnesses stopped in front of the city's police station, and were prevented from fulfilling their threats by police intervention. As a result, defendants were convicted under the ordinance in the city's police court and, on appeal to the district court, were convicted of the same after a trial de novo. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient. Because the district court heard the case as a trial de novo on an appeal from the city's police court, the trial court properly took judicial notice under Idaho Code &sect; 9-101 of the city's ordinance. Thus the court overruled State v. Egli, 41 Idaho 422, 238 P.514 (1925), to the extent that it conflicted with the court's holding. Because U.S. Const. amend. I and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 10 protected the right of peaceable assembly and had no reference to assembly for an unlawful purpose, the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

By the owners' acquiescence to changes incorporated in the working drawings prepared by their architect and by their verbal requests for other changes, they waived the requirement that all changes were to be ordered in writing. The owners knew that the changes involved extra costs. The builder arranged a meeting to discuss the matter of extra costs as soon as he knew that the original estimates had been exceeded and never relinquished his claim afterward. The evidence was sufficient to support the judgment on a quantum meruit basis. Attorney's fees were properly awarded pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 45-513, which did not violate equal protection by awarding attorney's fees to the lienor but not to the debtor. The owners' tender was insufficient to bar the award of costs and attorney's fees because it was less than the amount found to be due by the district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the taxpayer was entitled to its costs incurred on the appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. The court then considered whether the taxpayer was entitled to its costs incurred in the court.

The court found that because under Idaho Code &sect; 12-102(5), costs were allowed in cases involving the legality of taxes, and because Idaho Code &sect; 12-118 provided for the payment of costs from State funds, the State was liable for the taxpayer's costs in the court. The court refused to hold the tax collectors individually liable for costs because Idaho Code &sect; 6-611 provided immunity to public officers for actions performed under statutes that were subsequently declared void. Idaho Const. art. 7, &sect; 13, which provided that no money could be drawn from the treasury but in pursuance of appropriations made by law, barred any payment by the State of a claim for judgment interest without specific statutory authorization, and there was no such authorization in the Idaho statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant children's home sought review of an order of the Nez Perce County District Court (Idaho), which granted respondent father's petition for a writ of habeas corpus requiring the children's home to deliver custody of his two minor children to him. The children's home claimed that the district court's jurisdiction over the children had been terminated by a prior order of the probate court removing custody of the children from their parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a district court in a divorce action awarded custody of two minor children to their mother, the probate court, on successive petitions of third parties entered orders placing the children in the possession of the children's home. The children's father was not a party to either of these proceedings. The father then filed a petition in district court to modify his divorce decree to award him custody of the children and, at the same time, he filed a petition for habeas corpus to compel the children's home to deliver the children to him. The court held that the second probate court order, which found that the children had been neglected by both parents and removed them from their parents' custody, did not terminate the jurisdiction that the district court obtained over the children in the divorce action. The original jurisdiction of the district court in all cases at law and in equity, stemming from Idaho Const. art. V, &sect; 20, was not abridged by legislation in the area of neglected, dependent or delinquent children. The father's petition for habeas corpus was not an impermissible collateral attack on the probate court order because he was not a party to the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sought a writ prohibiting the judges from proceeding with the enforcement of a discovery order entered in the corporation's civil action, arguing that 1941 Idaho Sess. Law ch. 90, which authorized the Idaho Supreme Court to promulgate rules of civil procedure, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judiciary, and that certain of the rules, as promulgated, abridged its constitutional rights. The judges filed a motion to quash the writs. Upon consideration, the court granted the judges' motion. The court found in enacting the provisions of 1941 Idaho Sess. Law ch. 90 the legislature was not delegating legislative power to the Idaho Supreme Court; rather the court concluded that the legislature was merely recognizing the Idaho Supreme Court's inherent power in the realm of procedural rule-making. The court rejected the corporation's contention that ch. 90 was invalid because it granted the Idaho Supreme Court the power to repeal legislative acts, noting that 1941 Idaho Sess. Law ch. 90, &sect; 4 provided for the repeal of any statute inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the Idaho Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the period in question, Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316(a)(6) excluded employment by a school district from the definition of covered employment. Then, Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316B, which excluded only faculty members from the definition of covered employment, was adopted. The next year, &sect; 72-1316B was amended so that it included all other employees of public school districts. The next year, Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316(a)(6) was amended and Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316B, as amended, was repealed. The school district paid unemployment taxes during the first year that &sect; 72-1316B was in effect, but then refused to pay further taxes and sought a refund of the taxes it paid. On appeal, the court held that the district was liable for the taxes and that the taxation statute was not unconstitutional. The court held that a school district was not treated as a municipal corporation under Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 2. The tax imposed by the unemployment compensation statute was an excise tax, not a license tax. As such, it was authorized by Idaho Const. Art. VII, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had subdivided his land into two or more parcels within an interval of six months for the purpose of transfer of ownership, without submitting plans of such subdivision to the Ada County Zoning Commission for approval, which constituted a violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the amended complaint was defective in that it failed to allege facts constituting a subdivision of defendant's land in accordance with the definition of a subdivision as contained in the ordinance. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the amended complaint did allege facts constituting a subdivision of defendant's land. After describing the two parcels involved, the complaint alleged the sale thereof by defendant for the purpose of transfer of ownership or building development without any attempt being made by defendant to comply with the ordinance. Further, the ordinance was not unconstitutional. The ordinance was an attempt to regulate the subdivision of land and was an appropriate subject for police power legislation. Also, from the language used, it was clear that the approval of only those officials whose duty it was to examine a plan or plat before it was recorded was required. There was no unlawful delegation of legislative authority. Notwithstanding the fact that the Board of Commissioners may have in part misconceived the source of its power to enact the ordinance that did not invalidate it.</SPAN></P>

The writ permanently restrained the justice court from ordering the county's sheriff, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 18-3804, to destroy certain devices belonging to the owner. The State, through the Commissioner of Law Enforcement, alleged that the devices were gambling devices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting on an affidavit made by a law enforcement officer, the justice issued a warrant of seizure to the county sheriff. The devices were seized and delivered to the justice. The justice issued a notice to the person in charge of the business where the devices were seized, notifying him that a hearing would be held to determine if the devices were gambling devices and whether they should be destroyed. The owner then filed the suit at issue. The trial court held that &sect; 18-3804 violated Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because it allowed for the summary seizure and destruction of the devices without notice and hearing. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court. The problem with the statute was that it presupposed that the seized device was contraband and had to be destroyed. Essentially, the determination as to whether the device was a gambling device and thus contraband was made by the individual executing the affidavit. Because Idaho Code &sect; 18-3804 did not provide the owner notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the character of the devices, it was unconstitutional. The holding of unconstitutionality was limited in its application to the facts and circumstances at issue.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court stated that appellants had not engaged in general undertaking business, nor had they engaged in the manufacture or sale of general burial supplies or acquired any of the facilities therefor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners purchased property adjoining the city's municipal airport.

The result of the ordinance was to prohibit the use of portions of the landowners' property for any purpose other than agriculture. The landowners initiated an action against the city to declare the ordinance invalid. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the landowners. The city appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the ordinance amounted to a taking of the landowners' private property, including the airspace above their land, which could not be &quot;taken&quot; for a public purpose without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The construction of the statute and regulation urged by the business owner was untenable. To conclude that upon presentation of proof of age and identity satisfactory to the business owner, the business owner no longer had reasonable cause to doubt the legal age of the purchaser, or that the purchaser was no longer a person of doubtful age, would give to the business owner the authority to determine what constituted acceptable proof of age and identity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Third Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho) denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He alleged that his confinement was illegal because his sentences were void. His claim was that the sentencing judge had unlawfully delegated to an executive board the judicial function of fitting the punishment to the crime, and that his sentences were so excessive as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been convicted of two charges of robbery and one charge of escape from jail. He was sentenced to imprisonment in the state's prison for the term of his natural life, the specific term to be fixed by the State Board of Corrections on the robbery charges, and a consecutive five-year sentence on the escape charge. Appellant contended that Idaho Code &sect; 18-6503 was unclear because it did not clearly state that the sentencing judge could sentence him to a term of imprisonment longer than five years but less than life. The court reiterated an earlier holding that the statute was construed to allow sentences of more than five years and less than life. The court noted that the sentencing judge's pronouncement of sentence might not have been totally clear as to his understanding, but that error was not to be presumed. As to appellant's cruel and unusual punishment contention under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 6, because he had had opportunity to appeal and the inquiry on habeas corpus was essentially one as to jurisdiction, habeas was not available absent a challenge to the sentencing judge's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, county fair boards and quarter horse breeder, petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel respondent governor to appoint members of the Idaho Horse Racing Commission, as required by the Idaho Horse Racing Act (Act), 1963 Idaho Sess. Laws 64. The governor responded to an alternative writ of mandate issued by the court by acknowledging enactment of the Act but refusing to appoint members because the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor contended that the Act was an attempt to authorize a lottery in violation of Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 20. The county fair boards and the quarter horse breeder distinguished the pari-mutuel system of betting, which the Act permitted, from lotteries by asserting that the player, or bettor, could forecast with some degree of certainty the outcome of a race and place his bet accordingly. The court made its alternative writ of mandate permanent. The court concluded that a horse racing meet where the pari-mutuel system of wagering was used did not contravene the constitutional prohibition against lotteries. The Act was not in contravention of art. 3, &sect; 20 inasmuch as the pari-mutuel system of wagering on horse racing meets, as provided in the Act, was not one solely based on chance, which constituted an essential requisite of a lottery.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (Idaho) granted the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment in favor of the taxpayer, but without interest. The taxpayer and the state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that a state tax on a sale that occurred outside of the state violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The taxpayer also alleged that the tax impinged upon the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. Art. 1, &sect; 8(3). The court determined that the tax imposed was an excise tax that was exacted for the purpose of building and maintaining public highways within the state. The gasoline, which was the subject of the tax, was for use in the state. Furthermore, the taxpayer, by obtaining a license to distribute motor fuels within the state, subjected itself to the jurisdiction and control of the state. Accordingly, the court determined that the tax did not violate the due process clause or the commerce clause. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The director, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 72-1360, caused a certificate of contributions due to be filed with the county clerk and a writ of execution and notice of garnishment were executed by the sheriff, levying on the employer's bank account.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and remanded with instructions to reinstate the amended information. The court noted that it had already decided in a prior case that &sect; 49-1101 was not unconstitutional and void on the grounds of uncertainty and indefiniteness.

The corporation also argued that Idaho Code &sect; 23-1037 was unconstitutional in depriving the corporation of property without due process and of the right to a jury trial. The court held that the corporation was not deprived of due process because the statute afforded the corporation the right to judicial review. Further, the statute did not deprive the corporation of the right to a jury trial because the procedure was an administrative, disciplinary proceeding which was not violative of the right to trial by jury under Idaho Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the teachers' retirement system (TRS), filed a petition for a writ of mandate to require defendant, a state auditor, to transfer money from the state's general fund to the public school income fund in compliance with its request made pursuant to 1961 Idaho Sess. Laws 293 and to require the auditor to transfer the same sum from the public school income fund to the TRS pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 33-1509(c) (amended 1961).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The auditor argued that moneys appropriated from the general fund for the TRS and placed in the &quot;public school income fund&quot; commingled with income from the &quot;public school fund&quot; and that the demanded withdrawal would result in an impermissible expenditure of a portion of the income from the public school fund for purposes other than the support and maintenance of the state schools. The court found no constitutional objection to the method adopted. Under 1961 Idaho Sess. Laws 293, up to $ 200,000 could be appropriated from the general fund to make funds available for transfer to the TRS. The appropriation portion that actually reached the public school income fund of Idaho Code &sect; 33-1009 was earmarked for the TRS and thus prevented from becoming commingled with other moneys in that fund. Alternatively, regarding the income from the public school fund of Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 3 as dedicated to, and held in trust for, the support and maintenance of the state schools, the trust pursuit rule operated to prevent its inseparable commingling with moneys that could be appropriated to other uses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the 1951 Act, the Idaho legislature allocated one representative per county in compliance with the provisions of Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 4 and established the further classification of additional representatives on the basis of one for each additional 17,000 population and a remaining fraction amounting to 3,000 or more. The court found that the legislative plan was within the range of reasonable classifications within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment. Aside from the constitutional mandate, the legislature was to determine the method of apportionment. The claimed disparity of representation resulting from the application of the 1951 law to the 1960 census figures was not so clearly violative of the constitutional principal of equal protection that it had to be stricken down. The claimed disparity was a subject for presentation to, and consideration by, the legislature itself. The forthcoming session of the legislature was to have opportunity to consider the 1951 enactment in light of the present conditions and constitutional requirements and limitations on its authority under Idaho Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, and 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The elector instituted an action against the secretary to enjoin him from certifying to the respective county auditors the number of representatives each county was entitled to elect at the upcoming general election pursuant to the 1951 Act, Idaho Code &sect; 67-203. The trial court required certification by the secretary on the basis of the 1933 Act. The secretary appealed and the court reversed the judgment and held that the 1951 Act was constitutional. The court denied the elector's motion to dismiss. The court held that the determination of the number of representatives to constitute the house of representatives, as well as their allocation above the requirement of at least one per county, were decisions resting peculiarly within the area for legislative action. Such determinations were dependent on the information established by the U. S. Census. Until such time as the legislature had ample opportunity to fully examine the impact of the 1960 Census on the apportionment of representatives throughout the state, the court could not say that the 1951 Act was unconstitutional as having failed to grant representative rights of the citizenry of the state afforded by the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The secretary of state and the state attorney general contested the court's jurisdiction to issue the writs or to compel the Board to take any action. They further alleged that the claims were not properly certified. The court disagreed and ordered that the payments be made and denied the officials' petition for a rehearing. The court held that the officials lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of 1961 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 287 because they neither were personally liable or officially liable nor were they authorized or directed to act in any certain way. The court rejected the argument that the statute violated the separation of powers' doctrine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the court found that a separate fund had been established for the purpose of insuring employers against liability for workers' compensation claims. The fund consisted of all premiums, penalties and interest received and paid into the fund. The state insurance manager had the right to make contracts and employ personnel as needed to carry out the provisions of the fund. The manager was required to submit monthly statements to the state with an estimate for the monthly disbursements. The state treasurer, who was named custodian of the fund, was then authorized to pay the disbursements upon sight drafts drawn by the manager. In this manner, the statute established a continuing appropriation of the money in the fund for carrying out its purpose. The court found nothing illegal or improper in the agreement between the manager and the attorneys for the prosecution of subrogation claims on a contingent fee basis in paying the attorneys for their services. The state insurance fund, not being state money, and claims against it not being claims against the state, the state board of examiners had no power or jurisdiction over the fund.</SPAN></P>

The department claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff villages' appeal from the department's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After hearings in affected communities at which testimony was taken concerning anticipated effects of a proposed road on business, agriculture, development, and other matters, the department adopted one proposed route over another. The trial court reversed that decision on the ground that the department had failed to consider various factors and to properly consider protests, objections, and testimony at the hearings. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the action because Idaho Code &sect; 40-120(4) gave the board the power to locate, construct, alter, extend, and maintain state highways if the board determined it was in the public interest and did not provide for any appeal from the board's decision. The court rejected the villages' contention that the board's decision was appealable to the district court pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 40-121. That section did not apply because the board's decision merely concerned the location of a new road and did not provide for the abandonment, relocation, or replacement of a road. The villages had no protectible rights in the traffic flow that might be diverted to the new road.</SPAN></P>

An alternative writ of mandate was issued, and the clerk, by his return to the writ, presented for determination the issue of the constitutionality of 1961 Idaho Sess. Laws 89, the legislation under which the bonds were issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clerk argued that 1961 Idaho Sess. Laws 89 violated Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 16, which required that the subject of an act be expressed in its title. The court agreed that 1961 Idaho Sess. Laws 89, which attempted to amend Idaho Code &sect; 33-909, did not comply with Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 16 because several substantive changes that the act proposed to be made to Idaho Code &sect; 33-909 were not expressed in the title of the act. However, the court concluded that the bond issue in the instant case was properly authorized and, therefore, ordered the clerk to countersign the bonds, explaining that his act of countersigning the bonds was a ministerial duty, and his refusal to do so was without legal justification. The court noted that, when the title to a statute that was being amended particularized some, but not all of the changes, the legislation was limited to the matters specified, and anything beyond them was void, however germane they might have been to the subject of the original act. The court noted, however, that the title to the act included a reference to the vote required for the approval of the issuance of school district bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the writ of mandate be made permanent and that the clerk be directed to countersign all of the bonds, which had been duly authorized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the constitutionality of amendments to Idaho Code &sect; 54-901. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the legislation was within the power and authority of the legislature to adopt and secured to the public protection from diagnosis, prescription, or treatment by unqualified practitioners. Idaho Code &sect; 54-905 prohibited the practice of dentistry, or the holding of oneself out as being qualified to practice dentistry, by persons who were not dentists. Idaho Code &sect; 54-930 excepted from that prohibition physicians, surgeons, dentists licensed in other states, instructors, and any person performing merely mechanical work upon inert matter in a dental laboratory. The amendment then limited the &sect; 54-930 exception to activities related to dental prosthetic appliances that did not require the presence, aid, assistance or cooperation of the user.

Defendant also argued that it was error to admit into evidence a traffic report that fixed and designated the speed limit on the road on which he was travelling at the time of accident that gave rise to his conviction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, opining that the crime with which defendant was charged arose out of the operation of a vehicle &quot;on the highway,&quot; which was within the subject expressed in the title of Idaho Code &sect; 49-1101. The court further opined that &sect; 49-1101 was not unconstitutional for uncertainty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Canyon County (Idaho), which, after a police court had found defendant guilty of violating the reckless driving statute, Idaho Code &sect; 49-1103, sustained defendant's demurrer to the complaint on the grounds that it did not state an offense and did not allege particulars as to time, place, person, and property, without allowing the State to amend the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's appeal of the police court conviction to the district court, defendant's demurrers to the complaint, based on the assertion that it did not state an offense or allege the particulars as to time, place, person, and property, were sustained, and the action was dismissed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, noting first that the district court had authority to determine the issues raised by demurrer. Because there was nothing in the complaint to indicate what acts of defendant constituted allegedly reckless driving, the district court properly sustained the demurrer. A conviction for an offense pleaded with particularity could be pleaded as a bar to another charge for the same offense. Not only was there nothing in the record to show that the State could not have satisfied the particularity requirement through amendment, but there was no showing that defendant would suffer prejudice as a result. An amendment should have been allowed, the court said, adding that the statute set forth the elements of the offense and, thus, was not unconstitutional by reason of uncertainty.</SPAN></P>

The Board excluded his work relating to crop-dusting because it was agricultural labor, which Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316 excluded from the definition of covered employment under the Employment Security Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee performed a variety of piloting services for the employer, but his crop-dusting work was the most remunerative. The pilot's service as a crop-duster consisted almost exclusively of flying the airplane. He contended that because his service as a pilot was a highly skilled profession, he was not engaged in agricultural labor while spraying or dusting a farm crop. On appeal, the court rejected employee's contention. The legislature, when enacting the Employment Security Law clearly intended that the term agricultural labor, when used in connection with the Employment Security Law had the meaning ascribed to it in that law. &quot;Agricultural labor&quot; encompassed services rendered in every process and step taken and necessary to the production of a finished farm product. It followed that spraying, dusting, or otherwise treating a growing crop was as much agricultural labor as was irrigating and cultivating the crop. The court held that Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316(a)(1) was not so arbitrary, unfounded, or unreasonable that it violated any provision of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The commissioners sought a determination as to the propriety of a constitutional amendment that modified the jurisdiction and powers of the office of the justice of the peace.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Idaho Legislature proposed an amendment to Idaho Const. art. 20, &sect; 2, and the electorate ratified the proposed amendment. The amendment modified the jurisdiction and powers of the office of the justice of the peace.

The justice of the peace contended that the amendment was unconstitutional because it lumped together in a single amendment diverse issues that were readily divisible into distinct and independent issues concerning the duties and powers of the office of the justice of the peace. He argued that the proposed amendment consisted of several amendments and that they were not submitted in such manner that the electors should vote for or against each of them separately. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, which held that the amendment was constitutional. The court held that it was within the discretion of the legislature to submit the propositions to the electors in one proposal and that the submission did not violate art. 20, &sect; 2 because the proposals were germane to the common object and purpose of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of an order of the trial court (Idaho), which denied their motion to intervene as defendants in an action brought by respondent landowners against defendant city to challenge the city's refusal to grant respondents permission to use their property for service station purposes. The trial court held, in part, that appellants did not have sufficient interest in the issues framed to justify their intervention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned land next to the property that respondents wanted to use as a service station. On appeal, the court held that appellants' defense and the main action had a question of law in common and that appellants had sufficient interest in the matter in litigation to entitle them to intervene. Idaho R. Civ. P. 24(b), which governed the motion for permissive intervention, had to be given liberal construction. The rule did not require intervenors to have a direct or personal pecuniary interest in the subject of the intervention. Precedent construing the rule's predecessor held that the interest which entitled a person to intervene had to be in the matter of litigation, and of such a direct and immediate character that the intervenor would either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment. Appellants alleged that interest by arguing that allowing the service station to be built would damage their use of their property. Further, appellants would have had been entitled to oppose the application before a zoning commission. There was no merit to the trial court's finding that permitting intervention would unnecessarily and unreasonably delay the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondents discontinued an elementary school and made it a junior high school, appellants instituted an action to compel respondents to order an election to be held, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 33-522(b) (1955), to determine whether the elementary school should be discontinued. The trial court issued an alternate writ of mandate but entered judgment dismissing and quashing the writ. Appellants sought review and argued that the court erred in granting the motion to dismiss and in failing to hold &sect; 33-522(b) unconstitutional as violative of Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 21, by depriving the people of home rule of public schools. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that no discontinuance of an &quot;attendance unit&quot; was effectuated by respondents' action. Concerning the constitutionality of &sect; 33-522(b), the court noted that the Idaho Constitution was a limitation, not a grant of power. The court held that an examination of &sect; 33-522(b) failed to establish any constitutional violation or to disclose any provision forbidding the legislature from authorizing the boards of trustees of reorganized school districts from assigning students within the district as they saw fit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 1959 Idaho Sess. Laws 265, the legislature sought to authorize municipalities to, among other things, lease projects for the purpose of inducing manufacturing, industrial, and commercial enterprises; municipalities were also given the power to issue revenue bonds for the purpose of defraying the costs of such leases. The municipality entered into an agreement with the lessee, but the lessee refused to perform upon its counsel's advice that 1959 Idaho Sess. Laws 265 was unconstitutional. The district court determined that the legislation was constitutional. In reversing the judgment on appeal, the court held that the legislation was not constitutional because its purpose was to lend the credit and faith of the municipality in aid of the lessee. The legislation could not be upheld because the proprietary powers of municipal corporations in the state were limited to functions and purpose that were municipal and public in character as distinguished from those that were private in character and engaged in for private profit. Moreover, the incidental benefit to the public did not transform the private industrial enterprise into a public one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association filed an application for insurance of its accounts.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in striking the provision. The main question to be resolved was whether or not the state legislature, contrary to the constitution, unlawfully delegated its authority to the federal government and a federal agency. The court concluded that the portions of the law declared invalid were not severable from those requiring insurance of accounts. Therefore, the trial court's judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (Idaho) entered a judgment for plaintiff, but upon defendants' motion for a new trial, a successor trial court vacated the judgment and entered a judgment for defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The successor trial court found that a 1892 decree adjudicating the rights to use the creek water by the parties' predecessors in interest fixed the priority dates of all of the water rights of defendants' predecessors at times prior to the right given to plaintiff's predecessor for the use of the creek water and that defendants' rights were not limited to the irrigation season. On appeal, plaintiff contended that the successor trial court had no authority to vacate the first trial court's findings and conclusions and erred in interpreting the 1892 decree. The court held that, under Idaho R. Civ. P. 59(a), the successor trial court upon defendants' motion for a new trial was authorized to make new findings and conclusions and to direct the entry of a new judgment. The successor trial court was not required to weigh conflicting evidence or determine the credibility of witness and thus did not exceed its authority or abuse its discretion when it set aside the findings, conclusions, and decree of the first trial court without a new trial. Further, the successor trial court correctly construed and applied the 1892 decree in determining the parties' water rights.</SPAN></P>

The parties submitted the matter on an agreed statement of facts, which the trial court accepted and incorporated into its findings of fact, on the basis of which the trial court held by its conclusions of law and declaratory judgment that Sess. Laws 1957, ch. 336, &sect; 3 was unconstitutional and void, being in violation of the provisions of Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 18. The official appealed and by his assignments of error generally questioned the validity of the trial court's decision. In reversing the decision, the court held that only by a strained construction of the phraseology of the title to the act could a legislator or a member of the public be misled.

The trial court ruled that the regulation was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. On appeal the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that: (1) the trial court properly determined that the regulation as interpreted by the Board was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable because the student was improperly classified as a non-resident student upon registration and the regulation denied the student of an opportunity to be heard in the matter and (2) the trial court erred in holding that the regulation was an attempt on the part of the Board by regulation to assume and usurp the power vested only in the legislature because the legislature delegated to the Board the power to make rules and regulations necessary to the government of the college and the Board's official interpretation of the rule became a part of the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent's will left the proceeds of a joint savings account with his daughter to his grandsons.

At his death, decedent held two joint bank accounts with his daughter with survivorship rights. During his life, decedent purchased United States savings bonds made payable to himself or his daughter. The district court had impressed a constructive trust upon the funds that were earmarked for decedent's grandsons in the will, but which had been transferred, which was not challenged. The court held that the amounts held in the joint bank accounts with survivorship rights were not owned by the daughter, but were owned by the estate because the daughter had failed to prove that decedent intended to gift the proceeds to her after his death. The court further held that the daughter, as the named surviving co-owner, was the owner to the legal title of the savings bonds because the district court under Idaho Code &sect; 17-103 had no jurisdiction of equity matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mill worker sought review of the decision of a district court (Idaho) that affirmed the judgment that was entered in favor of plaintiff attorney in the small claims court of Grangeville Precinct in Idaho County (Idaho) in the attorney's action to recover for damages to his automobile, which was allegedly due to the mill worker's negligence. The small claims court denied the mill worker's request to be represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mill worker contended that Idaho Code &sect; 1-1508, which prohibited attorney representation in the courts of the small claims department of the justices' courts, by denying him the right of representation by counsel in the small claims court, denied him of due process of law and equal protection of the law in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 13 and 18. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, opining that Idaho Code &sect; 1-1508 was not violative of either the United States Constitution or the Idaho Constitution. The court reasoned that, although Idaho Code &sect; 1-1508 prohibited representation of either party litigant by an attorney, Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 1-1511 and 1-1512 recognized that such a right existed on appeal and trial de novo of the case in the district court, by virtue of the right accorded to the plaintiff-respondent, if successful on the appeal, to recover an attorney's fee. Thus, the court concluded that, as a result of a litigant's right to an attorney on appeal, Idaho Code &sect; 1-1511 satisfied constitutional due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state of Idaho (state) and Idaho Board of Highway Directors (board), sought review of an order of a district court (Idaho), which declared that Idaho Code &sect; 40-120(27), as amended by 1957 Idaho Sess. Laws 227, was constitutional and that respondent public utility companies (utilities) were entitled to recover out of the State Highway Fund certain costs incurred by the utilities in relocating their facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the board requested the utilities to relocate certain facilities to make way for a proposed highway reconstruction project, the utilities demanded reimbursement of the relocation costs. The board refused to reimburse the utilities and the state filed a declaratory judgment action on behalf of the board. The district court held that Idaho Code &sect; 40-120(27) was constitutional and that the utilities were entitled to reimbursement. On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 40-120(27), which provided that the utilities' relocation costs were to be paid out of the State Highway Fund, violated Idaho Const. art. 8, &sect; 2, and art. 7, &sect; 17. The court held that (1) the utilities had a permissive right to use the public roads; (2) the legislature was precluded by Idaho Const. art. 11, &sect; 13 from abrogating the common law rule that the utilities were obligated to pay the relocation costs; and (3) the relocation of the utilities' facilities was not a taking of private property for public use. Thus, the court held that Idaho Code &sect; 40-120(27) was unconstitutional, but that the unconstitutional portions were separable from the Highway Administration Act of 1951, 1951 Idaho Sess. Laws 93.</SPAN></P>

Governor, and all of the Thirty-fifth Session of the Idaho Legislature to sign and present a certain house bill, as amended and passed by both houses, to the governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill in question was an income tax act that was amended during its course through the house by changing a certain numerical figure representing a tax rate from &quot;3.5&quot; to &quot;3.&quot; The amended bill was eventually passed by the house and the senate. Through oversight or error in enrolling, the subject amendment was omitted and the enrolled bill was signed by the president of the senate and the speaker of the house and was approved by the governor without the house amendment. Plaintiffs argued that the bill as enrolled was invalid and requested an order requiring defendants to correctly enroll the bill to include the amendment. Defendants contended the bill was invalid and that it could not be corrected. The court found that the error, although clerical in origin, materially affected a vital matter of substance. The record conclusively showed that all three divisions of legislative power -- the house, the senate, and the governor -- approved the amendment and made it part of the act. The court held that the bill was constitutionally enacted as amended by the house and that the act was valid and the subsection containing the typographical error must be read as the number three.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue raised was whether the governor as chief officer of the Bureau had the power and duty to perform or cause to be performed the audit as authorized and directed by Idaho Code &sect;67-2703, referred to as a &quot;post audit.&quot; The court ordered a writ of prohibition issued as prayed for, finding that the Bureau came into existence by virtue of 1923 Idaho Sess. Laws 164. The court thus concluded that the Bureau was lawfully created and legally existed. Additionally, the court found that under the provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 67-2702, it was clear that the governor was the chief officer of the Bureau and as such was entitled to engage, direct, or discharge the personnel authorized to be employed by said Bureau. Further, the court determined that the language of Idaho Code &sect; 67-2703 clearly provided that the making of an audit as therein described was a function and duty to be performed by and through the Bureau. The court found that it was a ministerial duty that the legislature could lawfully confer upon any office of its own creation because it neither added to, diverted from, nor conflicted with the powers or duties of any constitutional office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building was to be for the State Department of Highways: 1959 Idaho Sess. Laws 83 appropriated money out of the highway fund to the Board to construct the office building. An issue was the constitutionality of ch. 83 given the Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 17, which required that certain taxes and fees be used exclusively for the construction, repairs, maintenance, and traffic supervision of the public highways of Idaho and the payment of the interest and principal of obligations incurred for said purposes. It was argued that the construction of the building for housing employees was not within the purview of &sect; 17. The court held that ch. 83 in no way violated the Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 17. The language of &sect; 17 included all aspects of setting, opening, construction, and maintenance of an efficient highway system including housing facilities required for the proper housing and protection and the functioning of the myriad of activities necessarily attendant to carrying out the objectives of &sect; 17; however, the court would not issue the writ sought as the subject vouchers had to be presented to the Board of Examiners first under Idaho Code &sect; 40-2212.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident commenced proceedings to determine the validity of an election for organizing a water district. The district court rendered its judgment dissolving the water district after concluding that Idaho Code &sect; 42-3207, which prohibited residents and qualified electors from voting if they did not pay property tax, was unconstitutional and, therefore, rendered the entire Water and Sewer District Act, Idaho Code tit. 42, ch. 32, under which the water district was created, invalid. The water district appealed. In reversing and remanding with directions to dismiss the proceeding, the court concluded that because the objectionable portion of Idaho Code &sect; 42-3207 was severable, the entire act was not unconstitutional; rather, the unconstitutional portion was to be excised, and the remainder of the statute was valid. Further, the resident lacked standing to challenge the validity of the municipal corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state board of medicine filed a complaint charging a naturopathic doctor with the unlicensed practice of medicine and requesting an injunction to permanently enjoin his practice. The doctor filed a demurrer in response to the complaint. The district court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the state board's complaint. The state board appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the practice of naturopathic medicine was not the practice of medicine and surgery, and to require those desiring to practice naturopathic medicine to meet the requirements prescribed for physicians and surgeons would be an unreasonable regulation of the occupation. Naturopathic doctors employed drugless treatment of diseases, including the use of light, air, water, heat, rest, diet, herbs, and massage; as such, the practice differed significantly from that of medicine and surgery. Because the state legislature did not treat the practice of chiropractic medicine or osteopathic medicine as it treated the practice of medicine and surgery but regulated those occupations separately, the practice of naturopathic medicine could not be deemed to fall within the ambit of medicine and surgery.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the legislature was not precluded from conferring upon the department the power to prescribe regulations concerning motor vehicles used on public highways within definite limits fixed by the legislature. Thus, the court concluded that there was no constitutional infirmity in &sect; 49-714. Appellants also urged that there was a want of evidence to show that the no-passing line was placed or maintained by the department or by its authority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature appropriated monies from the Highway Fund to a county treasurer to be placed in a special fund and used as directed by commissioners of that county for the construction and repair of a named road. Thereafter, the county commissioners and the county treasurer requested the state auditor to draw a warrant on the state treasurer in order to make payment of the funds so appropriated. The auditor refused, claming that the appropriation by the legislature violated Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 19. As such, the county commissioners instituted an action and an alternative writ of mandate issued. The court noted that the legislature was not permitted to pass a local or special law authorizing the maintenance of highways or grounds not owned by the stated. Because the legislature's appropriate was a local and special law that was prohibited, the court ruled that it was unconstitutional.

The court also stated that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that defendant was driving at an excessive rate of speed, after taking into consideration the time of night of the accident, the icy and slippery roads, and the distance traveled by the car after it went into the borrow pit. The court stated that the jury was entitled to consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident in determining defendant's reckless disregard and that Idaho Code &sect; 49-1101was not unconstitutional as it definitely made it a crime for a driver to injure and cause the death of another by driving an automobile in reckless disregard of the safety of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife duly filed their joint income tax returns for the years 1954 and 1955. The Commissioner subsequently notified the husband and wife that there were deficiencies for both years, together with penalty and interest. The deficiencies were determined by the disallowance of claimed expenses for travel each day by the husband from his home to his place of temporary employment and return. When the State Tax Commission affirmed the Commissioner's finding, the husband and wife commenced an action with the trial court protesting the order determining such deficiencies. The trial court subsequently granted the husband and wife's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that the expenses of the husband in traveling from his home to various construction jobs were reasonable and necessary traveling expenses, and such expenses were incurred while the husband was away from home in pursuit of his trade of electrician. As such, the trial court correctly held that such expenses were deductible items of expense under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3016(a)(1).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment that quieted title to the property in favor of the beneficiaries because the principals agreed and authorized the sale of the property by the trustee without judicial proceedings and without a right in them to redeem.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, the trial court instructed the jury under the language of Idaho Code &sect; 49-562A, 1951 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 256, pg. 555. He contended that the statute and instructions were unconstitutional and void because they were ambiguous and uncertain, thereby failing to prescribe a comprehensive standard of negligent driving sufficient to constitute an offense. On appeal, the court held that a statute was required to sufficiently show what the legislature intended to prohibit or punish. Because the statute defined negligent driving as operating a motor vehicle in a manner likely to endanger persons or property, and any operation of a vehicle could endanger persons or property, the statute did not clearly outline the prohibited conduct. Drivers had a right to know which acts were prohibited and condemned in order to know which were to be avoided.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought suit to recover taxes allegedly paid in error. Defendant contended that there was no overpayment, as plaintiffs were not entitled to exempt from taxation the interest on their out-of-state investment bonds. The trial court awarded a judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and defendant appealed. The appellate court held that the interest was taxable income, because it was part of plaintiffs' earnings. The fact that the bonds were purchased in the State of New York was not relevant. Plaintiffs earned the interest as part of their business within the State and therefore it qualified as interest arising within the state to be construed as part of plaintiffs' taxable net income.

The court held that the judicial power was settled in specially designated courts and could not be conferred upon the Board of another agency of the executive department in the absence of constitutional authority. The court held that the provision had the effect of depriving the dredging company of a valuable property right without due process of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party filed a negligence action against respondents. The court affirmed the dismissal of the action against the officer based on the injured party's failure to give the written undertaking required by Idaho Code &sect; 6-610. The statute was constitutional as a clear exercise of the police power intended to secure effective law enforcement by freeing police officers from the fear of vexatious litigation. The statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it did not create an impermissible classification by requiring plaintiffs to secure attorney fees before trial, but not requiring the same of defendants, where both classes potentially contained persons of all backgrounds. The limitation was reasonable and had a direct tendency to accomplish the legislative purpose. The court reversed the dismissal of the action against the state finding that although Idaho Code &sect; 41-3301 did not contain a waiver of immunity, the state had to continue as a nominal party for purposes of determining its liability in order to fix the liability of the insurer of the state vehicle where the policy indemnified the state against liability rather than actual loss.</SPAN></P>

The court held that where either constitutional or vested property rights were involved, the judicial department of the government must afford a remedy for the protection of such rights. The trial court did not err in construing the statutory provision for appeal as authorizing a trial de novo. The trial court properly concluded from the findings that the best interest of the students would be served by making the requested change and that no financial hardship would result to the school districts. The court, however, found no support for the statement by the trial court that the board should order other changes and transfers of funds as equitable to the districts involved. The court ordered the statement stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, in answering, alleged that Idaho Code &sect; 67-412 (1951), purporting to authorize payment of such expenses in the sum of $ 5 per day as committee expenses, was in violation of Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 23. In ordering that the writ issue, the court found no limitation in Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 3 forbidding the Legislature to provide for the payment of expenses of its members. It expressly allowed each member $ 10 per day &quot;for his services,&quot; and provided that such per diem was not to exceed $ 600 for any one person for any one session. It also allowed a lump sum for travel and was silent as to any other expenses. If followed that the enumeration for an allowance for services and for travel and the absence of any restrictive terms limiting the Legislature to such allowances left the Legislature free to provide for the payment of other expenses necessarily incurred by its members in the discharge of their duties. The court emphasized that an express enumeration of legislative power was not exclusive of others not named, unless accompanied by negative terms. To construe the phrase &quot;for committee expense&quot; broadly was not beyond the scope of the court's judicial function.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A collection agent applied for an agent's permit, but the state commissioner of finance denied the application because the agent was not a resident of the State as required by Idaho Code &sect; 26-2211(g). The agent brought an action against the commissioner for a declaratory judgment to determine his rights and to decide the constitutionality of the statute. The lower court found in favor of the commissioner, and the agent sought review. On review, the court found that the requirement that agents be residents of the State was a proper exercise of the State's police power to regulate certain professions. The regulations had direct and substantial relation to the valid object of protection of the public. The court confirmed that the legislature determined the qualifications for licensure of an agent and that residence in the State was one of the qualifications.

As a result, the property owner sought to compel the city to require the adjoining owners to move the house back to the established set back line. The district court refused to issue a writ of mandate, based on the adjoining property owners' contention that the local zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and violated the statutory grant of power from the state because it permitted non-uniform set backs across zones based on average distances from any given street. On review, the court found that the ordinance was barred by both Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 50-401 and 50-402 that granted cities the power to enact zoning restrictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the minor was only 17, his burglary charge was transferred to the probate court under the Youth Rehabilitation Act. Although Idaho Const. art. V, &sect; 20 vested in the district court original jurisdiction of felonies, Idaho Code &sect; 16-1803(1)(c) took away such jurisdiction completely as to persons under 18. Under this section and Idaho Code &sect; 16-1806, burglary by one under 18 years could not be treated as a crime by the district court unless the probate court in effect gave its permission, although under Idaho Code &sect; 18-201(1) persons 14 years of age or older were capable of committing crimes. The legislature, by denoting as a civil matter what the law had previously regarded as a felony, attempted to take away jurisdiction vested in the district court by the constitution itself, and had attempted to render that court powerless to do anything about the prosecution of such persons. Idaho Code &sect; 16-1803(1)(c), insofar as it attempted to deprive the district court of such jurisdiction, was in violation of Idaho Const. art. V, &sect; 20, in cases such as this where the accused waived the benefits of the Act and asserted his right to be prosecuted under the criminal law.</SPAN></P>

VII, &sect; 17. On appeal, the court noted that the Highway Fund was not segregated as to its sources. The court agreed with the district court that 1955 Idaho Sess. Laws 234, &sect; 6, insofar as it attempted to appropriate funds to the Idaho Development and Publicity Fund, was invalid and unconstitutional in that it attempted to use State funds for a purpose entirely contrary to and in conflict with the plain and unambiguous restrictions and limitations imposed by Idaho Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fertilizer company retained the services of a construction company to perform reconstruction work at its plant. During the construction process, a labor dispute arose between the construction company and the union that represented some of its employees. Because of the dispute, union members picketed outside of the fertilizer plant, contending that the fertilizer plant was unfair to organized labor. The fertilizer company filed suit to enjoin the union from picketing outside of its facility. Although the district court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining further picketing, it subsequently rendered judgment dissolving the temporary injunction. The fertilizer company appealed. In reversing and remanding with instructions to make the temporary injunction permanent, the court concluded that the union's activities constituted a secondary boycott and were prohibited by Idaho Code &sect; 44-801. The right of union members to picket and exercise free speech against their employer did not authorize picketing or other conduct designed to injure someone not a party to the labor dispute.</SPAN></P>

The court found that art. VIII, &sect; 3 was all-inclusive and no school district could incur bond indebtedness without a two-thirds approval of the voters in any school district.

The legislature then enacted 1955 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 277, which among other things made it the obligation of the Treasurer to pay the bonds. This she refused to do. In denying her motion to quash and making the writ of mandate permanent, the court first held that 1955 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 277 did not violate Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2. 1955 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 277 was not a loan of the credit of the State of Idaho to, or in aid of, individuals and corporations. It was not dispositive that the bonds were revenue bonds with no claim on the general fund. The state had plenary power to finance the dormitory from the general fund had it desired to do so. 1955 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 277 was enacted for a public purpose, the funding of education. 1955 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 277 also did not violate Idaho Const. art. IV, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent estate appealed from a judgment of a trial court (Idaho) awarding petitioner, the superintendent of the state hospital, an amount representing the hospital's charges for the care and treatment of the adult, incompetent son of the estate's decedent. The estate claimed that there was no basis for holding it liable for the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he was 30 years of age, married, and the father of three children, the decedent's son was adjudged to be an insane person and was committed to and confined in the state mental hospital. He had no assets to pay for his care and treatment, and no one paid the State anything on his behalf. After his mother died, the superintendent of the state hospital sued the mother's estate for an amount representing the hospital's charges for her son's care and treatment. The court reversed a judgment for the superintendent. At common law, a parent ordinarily was under no legal obligation to support his or her adult child. Accordingly, the right to maintain an action against the estate of a parent for the support of an adult child who was competent when he attained majority would have to be a statutory creation. Nowhere in Idaho Code &sect; 66-354, the only statute authorizing the superintendent of the hospital to recover from persons legally liable for the support of a patient, was the superintendent given the right to sue the estate of a deceased relative to impose a liability not imposed during the lifetime of the relative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed with instructions to the trial court to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

The governor's requisitions did not contain copies of arrest warrants of the applicants. The applicants argued that under &sect; 19-4503, the extradition papers were fatally defective because they did not contain copies of warrants of arrest The court stated that it was the affidavit, not the issuance of a warrant, that constituted a charge against a fugitive. Furthermore, the right of interstate extradition was a federal matter, and the federal law was supreme. Neither the Constitution nor 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182 required the issuance of a warrant of arrest by the demanding executive authority. Arizona, which had a statute identical to Idaho Code &sect; 19-4503, had held the phrase in that statute &quot;together with a copy of any warrant which was issued thereon&quot; to be in conflict with 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182. Both Arizona and Idaho had adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act. Under Idaho Code &sect; 19-4526, which provided that the Act should be interpreted as to make uniform the law of the states that enacted it, the same phrase appearing in Idaho Code &sect; 19-4503 was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Idaho, on behalf of named dentists, filed a complaint for injunctive relief against defendant businessman based upon claims that the businessman was practicing dentistry without a license in violation of the dental code, Idaho Code &sect; 54-901 et seq.

Appellants contended that they were entitled to a decree perpetually enjoining the businessman from practicing dentistry in violation of the dental code, Idaho Code &sect; 54-901 et seq. An examination of the transcript disclosed that the businessman was not a dentist or the employee of a dentist, and, while the businessman did not perform all the acts defined as practicing dentistry and enumerated in Idaho Code &sect; 54-901, the transcript did establish that a number of such acts were committed by him. From the facts so proved, found, or admitted, it was clearly established that defendant was practicing dentistry without a license and without the qualifications required for such practice. Appellants were correct in their contention that the trial court should have make findings on all material issues.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed. The court first grappled with the challenge procedure and the nature of its jurisdiction over the matter. The court concluded that the titling of an initiative proposal as akin to the titling of a legislative enactment. The court noted that Idaho Const. art.

Pursuant to LLA, the city adopted Gooding, Idaho, Ordinance 252 (1947) in which all essential aspects conformed with and referred to the provisions of the LLA. Prior to 1949, the city remitted quarterly to the state treasurer the state's shares of such license fees. Subsequently, it refused to remit such license fees to the state. The state filed an action against the city to collect the sums owed. The trial court denied the state relief. It was asserted that the provisions of the LLA were unconstitutional under the provisions of Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 20.

As grounds of such challenge he set up various alleged errors in the proceedings of the grand jury, most of which were urged by him in the district court in his motion to set aside the indictment. The court noted that the office of the writ of prohibition was to arrest the proceedings of the lower court when such proceedings were without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such court: Idaho Code &sect;7-401. The court stated that it was available where there was a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law: Idaho Code &sect;7-402. The court held that the writ of prohibition was primarily concerned with jurisdiction and was not available to review errors committed in the exercise of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor alleged that he received his degree for naturopathy and that naturopathy was not the practice of medicine. The doctor instituted a declaratory action. Judgment was entered against the doctor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that it need not decide whether naturopathy was medicine because it was how the doctor held himself out and what he did. The evidence was that the doctor engaged in minor surgery and the dispensing of antibiotics and other drugs. The court held the drug was defined as any substance used as a medicine, or in making medicines, for internal or external use: a narcotic substance or preparation. Antibiotics were within the meaning of &quot;drug&quot; in Idaho Code &sect; 54-1802; thus, the conclusion was inevitable, therefore, the doctor in performing surgery, though classified by him as only minor, using drugs, and diagnosing by use of X-ray was practicing medicine and surgery without a license. Thus, the doctor was violating the law.</SPAN></P>

The inmate argued that Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-2505 and 18-2506,when considered together, were constitutionally offensive because they constituted an arbitrary and unnatural classification of offenses and, by doing so, denied to persons such as the inmate the equal protection of the law. The court denied the inmate's petition, holding that the classifications contained in Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-2505 and 18-2506 were not arbitrary or unreasonable but were founded on rational and natural distinctions and that, therefore, they did not deny persons the equal protection of the law either under the federal or state constitution nor offend either constitution in any other respect.

In reversing, the court held that the language of the information showed that the prosecution had chosen to proceed against defendant as a violator of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607. Because that was an included offense, the fact that he might have been prosecuted under the sodomy statute was a matter beyond the control of defendant and of which he could not complain, for the reason that a conviction or acquittal of either was a conviction or acquittal of the other.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, after being indicted pursuant to &sect; 18-6607, filed a demurrer alleging that the statute was unconstitutional because it denied him the equal protection of the laws, it provided for cruel and unusual punishment, and it violated due process principles based on its lack of definite and certain terms. The trial court discharged defendant after sustaining his demurrer, and the court reversed. The court held that the statute did not violate defendant's right to equal protection because it did not overlap with and was not inconsistent with the statutory definition of intent to commit rape under &sect; 18-907. Also, defendant's claim that the words &quot;lewd&quot; and &quot;lascivious&quot; contained in the statute were of such general import as to render the statute uncertain was without merit, and the certainty required by due process was present. However, in light of the statute's prescribed punishment of life imprisonment, defendant's cruel and unusual claim was viable. Thus, in order to render the statute constitutional, the court construed the law as permitting the trial court to impose a maximum imprisonment at less than life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors sought an election as provided for by Idaho Code &sect; 33-522, as amended by 1949 Idaho Sess.

In affirming the judgment the court first noted that as a procedural point, it was proper for the district court to make findings of fact and enter judgment immediately after overruling the trustees' demurrer, where the trustees did not further plead by answer. The court then rejected seriatim several constitutional objections to the amendments. First, the title did not violate Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 16, for failing to note that the length of time for notice of the election was only 10 days. Such detail was not required to be included in the title. Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 19, was not violated because the amendments operated on all organized districts where units were previously in operation. Uniformity of taxation was observed in any event, so Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 5, was not offended. Nor was Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, violated by the amendments, which were merely exponents of the home rule principle.</SPAN></P>

After the board affirmed the assessment, the taxpayer appealed to the Commission. Even though the Commission reduced the assessment, the assessor and the board refused to comply with the Commission's order, claiming that it was in excess of the Commission's constitutional powers and would result in an inequitable and unequal assessment between the same class of taxpayers in the county. Upon review, the court found that the legislative provision allowing an appeal from an order of the board, Idaho Code &sect; 63-2210, was not an infringement upon the board's constitutional powers. The court found that not only was the legislature not prohibited from conferring appellate power upon the Commission, but Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 12 expressly provided that the Commission should have other powers and perform such other duties as could be prescribed by law. Furthermore, the power to review upon appeal the order of the board could be vested by the legislature in an appellate board composes of administrative officers.

The court therefore found the ordinance to be constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shareholder challenged an order of the District Court, Third Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho) that granted the motion for nonsuit by respondent mutual irrigation corporation in the shareholder's action that sought judicial review of the denial by the Department of Reclamation (Idaho) of the shareholder's application to change the point at which it diverted the water to which its shares entitled it and the place of that water's use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of the nonsuit and the action's dismissal were based on the findings that the lands that the corporation's irrigation system could not irrigate the new lands that the shareholder sought to irrigate and that the corporation did not consent to the change of the diversion point. The court affirmed the order and awarded costs to the corporation, concluding that there was no claim, or evidence, that the corporation consented to the proposed changes. The corporation's assessment and collection of maintenance charges and the shareholders' prior use of the water did not constitute implied consent to the changes because no water was delivered to the shareholder through the corporation's system, and the corporation did not know of any diversion of that water except under the shareholder's separately decreed rights. The corporation's right to manage its affairs in the same manner as any other corporation resulted in it not having to provide any due process. Also, Carey Act companies received different treatment because 41 Idaho Code Ann. ch. 21 covered those companies' water rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of the corporation's motion for a nonsuit in the shareholder's action for judicial review of the denial of the shareholder's application to change the point at which it diverted the water to which its shares entitled it and the place of that water's use. The court also affirmed the action's dismissal and awarded costs to the corporation.</SPAN></P>

He subsequently filed an application for modification on grounds of a change of condition. The board made an additional award, but did not award benefits for permanent total disability. Five years and seven months later, the employee filed a petition seeking an award for permanent total disability. He claimed both that the board was in error in not making such an award in the last hearing and that he had suffered a change in condition under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 43-1113. The employer filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that the claim was barred under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 43-1407 because it was not filed within four years of the accident. The board dismissed the petition, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 43-1407 was not an unconstitutional denial of due process or an unreasonable classification under Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 13. It provided a means of making claims for change of condition and did not discriminate. The proper procedure for the employee when he was originally denied permanent total disability was to appeal that decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Idaho filed an action against respondent nonresidents to recover income taxes. The nonresidents argued that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 61-2415, providing for tax credits and exemptions, violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, and the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court, Tenth Judicial District, Nez Perce County (Idaho) ruled in favor of the nonresidents. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 61-2415, the nonresidents would receive a lesser tax credit than that given to residents in the same situation. The court stated that in a case involving New York taxes, the United States Supreme Court had held that such discrimination violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The statute was a general rule operating to the disadvantage of all nonresidents and favoring all residents. Accordingly, &sect; 61-2415 was unconstitutional and void for violating U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 insofar as it imposed a tax upon the nonresidents here. The State argued that because the tax commissioner had interpreted the law to give nonresidents the same exemptions or credits as nonresidents and had assessed the taxes here on that basis, the Constitution had not been violated. The court stated that because the statute was unambiguous, it could not apply the rule that a long-continued and consistently practiced interpretation of an ambiguous statute by an enforcement official would be given weight by the courts in the interpretation thereof. Another commissioner might follow the wording of the statute, which plainly did not give nonresidents the same exemptions as residents.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the information correctly identified the owner of the property as a company capable of holding title to the stolen items. Under Idaho Code &sect; 19-1315, the property was adequately enough described in information in order to apprise defendant of the nature and character of the charge against him. The omission of the word &quot;felonious&quot; from the information charging grand larceny was not a fatal defect. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury that defendant's possession of the property shortly after it was stolen was evidence from which the guilt might be inferred or in instructing that it could convict defendant if it found that his possession of the recently stolen property neither reasonable nor satisfactory. The use of the word &quot;satisfactorily&quot; in the instruction placed no burden on defendant to prove his innocence. Sufficient evidence supported the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court applied three factors of Brown balancing test and concluded that checkpoints were a minimally restrictive means of advancing government's compelling interest in wildlife preservation.

The court noted that an officer may stop a vehicle to investigate possible criminal behavior if there is an articulable and reasonable suspicion the vehicle is being driven contrary to traffic laws. Further, the court noted the plain language of Idaho Code &sect; 49-808 required use of a turn signal whenever a movement is made to the left or right on the highway.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County, Idaho, which upheld a magistrate's denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed a district court's judgment upholding a magistrate's denial of habeas corpus relief. Defendant had pleaded guilty to four counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor under Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607. Count two, which alleged physical contact between defendant and his victim, was upheld by the district court, but the other three counts were dismissed pursuant to an application for post-conviction relief. The appellate court concluded that defendant's habeas corpus claim of innocence was procedurally barred because it should have been raised in his application for post-conviction relief. Defendant's assertion that he was factually and legally innocent of the crime for which he was incarcerated was insufficient to allow him to pass through the gateway that would permit the court to consider his procedurally barred claim of actual innocence. Moreover, defendant did not have a constitutionally protected interest in parole. Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Blaine County that convicted and sentenced him for trafficking in cocaine, a violation of Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732B(a)(2)(A), and principal to trafficking in marijuana, a violation of Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-204 and 37-2732B(a)(1)(B). Defendant filed an amended notice of appeal to include the denial of his Idaho Crim. R. 35 motion for reduction of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence for trafficking in cocaine and principal to trafficking in marijuana. The reviewing court affirmed. The court found that the statutes at issue did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Until the amount of cocaine involved exceeded 28 grams, the prosecutor had no discretion to choose between the two statutes at issue. The court found that there was substantial and competent evidence to prove that 28 or more grams of cocaine were involved in the drug transaction. Thus, the district court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. The court could not say that the district court's 34-month delay in ruling on defendant's Idaho Crim. R. 35 motion was reasonable. Consequently, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider the original motion 34 months after it was filed. Although the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the original Rule 35 motion, its action in ruling on the merits was harmless error, as the motion was denied. The dismissal of defendant's second Rule 35 motion was proper due to its untimeliness and the fact that it was his second such motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction for trafficking in controlled substances was affirmed, and the order of the district court denying defendant's motion to reduce his sentence was affirmed. Defendant failed to establish that his prosecution under the statutes at issue violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution or the Idaho Constitution. Moreover, there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Third Judicial District (Idaho) convicting and sentencing him for trafficking in methamphetamine and marijuana. Defendant contended that the drug trafficking statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732B, was unconstitutional and that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers executed a search warrant at defendant's home. Police discovered more than 400 grams of methamphetamine and more than a pound of marijuana hidden in stash cans in the garage and outbuildings. Defendant was later tried and convicted of trafficking in methamphetamine and marijuana. On review, defendant contended the drug trafficking statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732B, was unconstitutional and that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support his conviction. The appeals court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute violated due process by not including an intent element, since only the legislature can define crimes. Similarly, the court rejected defendant's equal protection challenge since the increased punishment for larger amounts of controlled substances was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in curbing large-scale possession, manufacturing, and distribution of controlled substances. Finally, the court ruled the evidence was sufficient to establish constructive possession based on the numerous and varied locations and the storage of scales and drug packaging material in plain view on shelves in the garage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed defendant's convictions for trafficking in methamphetamine and marijuana because the evidence was sufficient to establish his constructive possession of the drugs. The court also rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to the drug trafficking statute because it was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in curbing large-scale possession, manufacturing, and distribution of controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment and the arrestee appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court found that the county could not be liable for a claim that arose out of an assault or battery and therefore, the trial court correctly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact in this claim. Further, the court ruled that the officers did not deprive the arrestee of a constitutional right by handcuffing her. The court balanced the interests of the suspect against the government interest at stake in effectuating a safe arrest, and found that the important interests of officer safety and jailhouse order justified the minor inconvenience suffered by the arrestee. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in finding no genuine issue of material fact and granting the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of kidnapping in the first degree and of lewd conduct with a minor child under 16 years of age. Defendant challenged numerous trial court rulings, as well as the admission of certain evidence. Defendant also challenged his determinate life term of imprisonment for each offense as excessive. On appeal, the court held that errors in a grand jury proceeding of the type alleged by defendant were not a sufficient basis to set aside the conviction after the petit jury found defendant guilty following a fair trial. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in admitting a physician's testimony as to the rape victim's statements because the victim had no reason to believe that she was seeing the physician for any reason other than treatment. The court concluded that the conviction and sentencing for two crimes did not violate the double punishment bar of Idaho Code &sect; 18-301 because the acts composing the two crimes were separable. The court also ruled that two life sentences did not constitute an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Accordingly, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

Idaho Code &sect; 37-2701(s) defined marijuana.

The court ruled that it did not have to reach this issue because it was raised for the first time on appeal. Defendant also argued that &sect; 37-2732B(a)(1) when read in conjunction with Idaho Code &sect; 37-2701(s), which defined marijuana, was void for vagueness because it failed to define what constituted a marijuana plant. The court ruled that this issue was also waived for failure to raise it below. The court also ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow a defense witness to read excerpts of defendant's medical record, which was already admitted into evidence. Per case law, there was no discernable difference between reading an exhibit and admitting an exhibit into evidence when the same information was imparted by each.

Although the magistrate's wholesale adoption of findings and conclusions drafted by the prosecutor was inappropriate, the court held that the findings were supported by substantial evidence. The court also held that defendant BAC test results were admissible, notwithstanding the lack of Miranda warnings, because they were not testimonial or communicative evidence and the officer's request for the test was not an interrogation. Furthermore, under Idaho Code &sect; 18-8002, defendant, by accepting the privilege of operating a motor vehicle upon Idaho's highways, consented in advance to submit to a BAC test.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court refused to consider defendant's allegation that &sect; 18-803 was constitutionally void for vagueness and overbreadth because defendant failed to raise the matter before the trial court. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment. At trial, there was a great deal of testimony regarding the actions of defendant and the probable causes of the fire, as well as testimony regarding the financial condition of the business. Defendant testified that she did not intentionally start the fire and offered several witnesses in support of her claim. However, the court found that the evidence, although conflicting, was sufficient to support the jury's finding of guilty. Accordingly, the court found that the trial court had not erred in refusing to given an instruction directing an acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged an order of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho) dismissing his application for post-conviction relief on the ground that the action was untimely. Petitioner was convicted of rape, forcible sexual penetration by use of a foreign object, and kidnapping in the second degree. He raised several challenges to the application of the statute of limitations, Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations of Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902. At the time of the petitioner's conviction, the statute provided a five-year limitation but it was amended to one year. The petitioner's application was not filed within one-year period. On appeal, the court affirmed the order summarily dismissing the application. The trial court properly raised the statute of limitations issue sue sponte. The time limit to file an application for post-conviction relief was not extended by any other collateral post-judgment proceeding. The shortened statute of limitation was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law when it did not increase the punishment or change the elements of the offense but only changed a procedure. The one-year period from the time of the effective date of the amendment was a reasonable amount of time in which to file an application. There was no Fourteenth Amendment due process violation. Although defendant may have been deprived of his right of access to the courts, and this deprivation temporarily tolled the statute, such tolling ceased when the petitioner retained an attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for driving without privileges upon a judgment, which was entered following a bench trial in the magistrate division. On appeal, the court found that the facts presented at the trial clearly showed that the sheriff did not stop or unreasonably detain defendant. The court concluded that the evidence garnered by the sheriff during his encounter with defendant was not suppressible as suggested by defendant, nor was the charge disposable on the ground that the arrest was unconstitutional as the result of an unreasonable stop by a police officer. The magistrate correctly denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Because the violation occurred during the period of suspension of defendant's license, he properly was charged with driving without privileges. Upon review of the record and consideration of the arguments presented, the court held that there was substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the state proved the essential elements of the crime of driving without privileges beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the court upheld the magistrate's decision that defendant was operating his vehicle without privileges, as charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tribal law enforcement officer stopped defendant after he was observed driving erratically. The law enforcement officer observed defendant's demeanor and ability to follow field sobriety tests. After defendant was arrested for driving under the influence, he sought to have all evidence from the search suppressed because the search had been illegal. The magistrate determined that the evidence had not been illegally obtained. The trial court reversed the order of the magistrate and determined that the evidence had been illegally obtained and required removal under the exclusionary rule. The State asserted that the law enforcement officer made a proper citizen's arrest. The court reversed the decision that suppressed the evidence because it determined that while the law enforcement officer was not acting in a capacity as a private citizen, and was therefore acting beyond his authority, the investigative stop did not violate defendant's constitutional rights, so there was no requirement to suppress the evidence. The court determined that the investigative stop made by the law enforcement officer without authority was not an arrest that entitled defendant to Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of a decision of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which affirmed an order of the magistrate below dismissing the petition for a writ of habeas corpus when the magistrate determined that the petition was to be treated as one for post conviction relief under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act (UPCPA), Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 19-4901 through 19-4911.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pleaded guilty to lewd conduct with a child. Acting pro se, he filed a pleading captioned &quot;Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus&quot; in the magistrate division. The petition alleged that at the time he pleaded guilty, he was mentally incompetent and requested counsel. The magistrate denied the request and granted the State's motion for dismissal. The inmate appealed. In affirming, the court held that the allegations of the inmate's petition amounted to assertions that his guilty plea was obtained and his conviction entered without observation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, the claims were governed by the UPCPA and were not properly presented through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Summary dismissal of the petition was improper as the allegations of the inmate that he had only recently been taken off certain medication that prevented him from filing his claim within the statute of limitations of Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902 were sufficient to raise factual issues. However, the court was constrained to affirm dismissal of the action because, pursuant to Idaho case law, dismissal was a proper response where the action was not filed in the correct district court.</SPAN></P>

The agents reported that the dancers wore G-strings that exposed the cleft of buttocks, the bar permitted simulated acts of sexual intercourse, and patrons touched or fondled the genitals of the dancers. The administrative hearing officer found that the testimony did not establish any violations and recommended against license revocation. The Director adopted the hearing officer's findings, but held that violations had occurred, which warranted revocation. The court held that the Administrative Procedures Act, specifically Idaho Code &sect; 23-1010A, governed the Director's actions and the standard of review to be applied to the trial court. Because judicial review was available to the bar, due process was satisfied. Under Idaho Code &sect; 67-5244, the Director had all decision-making power and could adopt or reject the hearing officer's findings. The testimony was sufficient to support the Director's findings that there had been violations, including the dancers wearing G-strings that exposed the cleft of buttocks and that patrons licked whipped cream from the dancers' nipples.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance (heroin). The prosecutor informed defendant that if he did not plead guilty, the State would dismiss that case and proceed with a new indictment against him for conspiracy to traffic in heroin, which had a greater penalty. Defendant failed to plead and the prosecutor submitted the heightened charge to the grand jury for the indictment. On appeal, the court held that defendant's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were not infringed when the prosecutor carried out his threat to indict defendant on the greater charge and that the threat was permissible. The matter took over 13 months before going to trial. Defendant contended that his motion to dismiss should have been grant based on violation of his right to a speedy trial. The court disagreed and held that a substantial portion of the delay was attributable to the defendant's late-filed motion to suppress evidence, which caused a timely trial to be vacated. The prosecution demonstrated good cause for the failure to bring the case to trial within six months as required under Idaho Code &sect; 19-3501.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to suppress the results of the blood test was denied, based on contentions that his statutory rights were denied. Defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to DUI. The court affirmed the conviction and the denial of the suppression motion, holding that Idaho Code &sect; 18-8002(4)(d) did not require suppression of the results of the State's BAC test whenever a police officer failed to inform the licensee of his rights under Idaho Code &sect; 18-8002(3)(d).

The court held that the existence of a language barrier for the inmate was a circumstance in which due process standards could require the appointment of a representative to assist the inmate. However, because the inmate could understand broken English, communicated in English, and was only limited in his ability to read written English, due process standards were satisfied by the appointment of an interpreter.

Because Idaho Code &sect; 43-726 did not create an exclusive remedy for the landowners, the trial court properly ordered the district to repay the purchase price to the buyer at the foreclosure sale, voided the tax deeds, and restored title to the landowners. Because the trial court did not find that the assessments themselves were unconstitutional, the landowners were not entitled to attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 or the private attorney general doctrine.

In affirming defendant's convictions, the court first held that under &sect; 19-404 the statute of limitations was tolled if either defendant was outside the state when the offense was committed, or he was outside the state during the limitations period. It was not necessary that both these conditions concur for the statute of limitations to be tolled. The court then held that Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607 was not void for vagueness because the terms &quot;lewd&quot; and &quot;lascivious&quot; were easily comprehended. The information was sufficient although it did not pinpoint the times when the offenses were alleged to have occurred.

The court affirmed the dismissal holding that the inmate presented no basis for the one-year time limitation found in Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902 to be tolled. Also, the alleged ignorance of a legal remedy or legal theories underlying a cause of action did not postpone commencement of a limitation period.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court agreed ruled that defendant was not seized prior to his abandonment of the drugs, because there was no physical restraint.

The district court summarily denied the petition, stating that the issues in the application should have been presented on appeal. The inmate appealed. In reversing and remanding, the court found that the district court erred in dismissing the application in reliance upon the affidavit of the inmate's former counsel, for the affidavit did not dispel all material factual issues. For example, the affidavit did not address the inmate's claim that the attorney failed to file an appeal despite the inmate's request. Mere conclusory assertions of the State's witnesses, unsupported by facts, were insufficient to support summary dismissal. On the record presented it was impossible to determine whether the attorney's advice to the inmate was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Consequently, summary dismissal was error.</SPAN></P>

He was initially charged with first-degree murder. After the district court denied his motions for dismissal or to adjudicate him as a youthful offender under the Youth Rehabilitation Act (YRA), Idaho Code &sect; 16-1801, et seq., he pled guilty to the lesser charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 14 years old at the time that he beat and stabbed another youth that he encountered during a night of cruising. The youth died from his wounds. Defendant was sentenced to a unified life sentence, with a fixed period of confinement of 25 years after the district court reviewed his presentence investigation report (PSI) and a psychological evaluation. The PSI revealed an extensive juvenile record, beginning at the age of 8 years old. In part, he was discharged from one treatment program because he verbally and physically abused his peers and members of the staff. On appeal, the court rejected his challenge to the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 16-1806A because that question had already been decided adversely to defendant's position. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence because it correctly concluded that society had to be protected from defendant and that defendant could access rehabilitative programs within the prison system. The sentence, with a minimum period of confinement of 25 years, furthered the sentencing goals of protecting society, deterrence and retribution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant telephoned children and discussed AIDS, the means of its transmission, use of condoms, and other matters of a sexual nature. Defendant contended that the statute under which he was convicted, Idaho Code &sect; 18-6710, was unconstitutionally overbroad and that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The statute was not overbroad because it did not prohibit the mere expression of ideas or information. Telephone calls made with a legitimate intent to communicate were not criminalized. The statute prohibited only telephone contacts made with a specific and exclusive intent to annoy, terrify, threaten, intimidate, harass or offend. The court concluded that use of a telephone transmission solely to inflict injury by destroying the mental tranquility of the listener was not protected speech, but conduct that could legitimately be proscribed by the state. Defendant also argued that the statute was void for vagueness because it did not define words such as &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;indecent.&quot; The court disagreed. The vagueness doctrine did not require that every word used in a criminal statute be statutorily defined.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's reversal of the magistrate's decision to suppress the results was reversed on appeal and the magistrate's order was reinstated. The question presented was at what point the right to confer with counsel accrued. The court held that when a driver is detained for driving under the influence, the right to counsel attaches once the driver has been arrested and charged. The court found that defendant's right to counsel attached immediately after she blew into a breath-testing device, obtained a result in excess of .10, and was issued a criminal citation. At that point, the court found that defendant had the right to consult counsel immediately upon request and the State was without authority to condition that right upon the completion of booking procedures. The court found that the State unconstitutionally infringed upon defendant's right to counsel because defendant's requests to speak to counsel prior to or during booking were not granted until one-half hour after defendant was placed in a cell. Therefore, the results of the breath test were inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with trafficking in marijuana, failure to affix a controlled substance tax stamp and possession of marijuana with intent to deliver after a search where police officers found baggies containing marijuana in the kitchen and in each of the bedrooms, and marijuana plants in a fourth bedroom which had been converted to a &quot;grow room,&quot; in a house occupied by defendant and three others. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that defendant's contention that the search warrant was invalidated because of one of the officer's non-compliance with Idaho Code &sect; 19-5109, which governed the Idaho Police Officers Standards Training certification of peace officers, to be unsupported by the record. The court determined that the officer had become certified within one year of her starting date as a peace officer, although she had served as a dispatcher for some time prior to becoming a peace officer. The court also found that information provided by the informant used in the affidavit for the search was corroborated in part when the officer discovered that defendant and two others lived in the house that matched the informant's description.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment of conviction for one count of rape and three counts of forcible sexual penetration by use of a foreign object, affirmed; judgment of conviction for two counts of infamous crime against nature, reversed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions from the District Court of the First Judicial District, Kootenai County (Idaho) of rape, forcible sexual penetration by use of a foreign object, and infamous crime against nature. He claimed that the prosecution's loss of evidence warranted dismissal of his indictment and that his prosecution for infamous crime against nature predicated upon sexual acts performed with his wife violated his right of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6605. The court noted that the state did not attempt to identify a governmental interest that would justify the intrusive invasion into marital privacy effectuated by application of &sect; 18-6605 to the private, consensual behavior of marital partners. Therefore, the court held that Idaho's statute prohibiting the infamous crime against nature could not be constitutionally enforced to prohibit private consensual marital conduct, and vacated defendant's convictions on those counts. As to the effect the loss of two photographs had on his trial, the court affirmed, holding that the content of the photographs was not controverted, and was known to two police officers, the prosecutor, and the victim. Given the tenuousness of the photographs' potential probative value to show consent, and recognizing that the photos were described to the jury, the court found it highly improbable that presentation of the photographs themselves would have changed the jury's verdict. The court affirmed defendant's remaining convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, insofar as it adjudged defendant guilty of two counts of the infamous crime against nature was reversed. The judgment was in all other respects affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In an action brought by contractor to recover additional costs of constructing motel for property owners, judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and vacated in part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor sought review of the judgment of the District Court of the First Judicial District of Shoshone County (Idaho), which found against respondent motel owner but only awarded eight percent of the contractor's alleged damages. Cross-appellant landowner also appealed, alleging that the district court erred in awarding the contractor additional money for the site work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor brought actions for breach of contract and lien foreclosure against the motel owner and the landowner. The district court granted judgment in favor of the contractor, but awarded costs and fees in favor of the landowner and the motel owner for defense of the subcontractors' liens. On appeal, the contractor argued that the district court erred in finding that the contract contained a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) and in making the contractor, rather than the motel owner, liable under Idaho Code &sect; 45-511 for payment of all fees connected with the subcontractors' liens. The court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. The court held that no valid reason was shown for denying the contractor the right to prove that its costs were increased as a result of changes in the work, quality of materials, equipment, and finishes that were to be provided when the GMP was established. The court also held that the contractor had the duty to defend against the claims of the subcontractors and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that there was no overall prevailing party as to the claims between the contractor and the motel owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that the parties' cost plus contract was subject to a guaranteed maximum price, which was not waived. The court remanded the case to the district court to consider the proof made and the proof offered by the contractor to establish its increased costs due to delays and changes caused by the landowner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought an action seeking compensatory and punitive damages against defendant developers for breach of contract, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The District Court of the Second Judicial District, Idaho County (Idaho) entered judgment in favor of the developers as to the emotional distress claim and in favor of the property owners on the remaining claims. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gravamen of the property owners' complaint was that the developers defrauded them out of a parcel of land by falsely presenting the impression that the developers were allied with the charitable purposes of the property owners. Among other contentions on appeal, the developers argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the fiduciary duty owed a client from a real estate agent. The court agreed. The complaint did not allege any real estate agent/client relationship and there was little if any evidence presented as to such a relationship. The existence of such a relationship would affect the duty of care owed to the property owners and subject the developers' conduct to closer scrutiny. Therefore, it was error to allow such instructions. The error was prejudicial because it misled the jury on a number of crucial issues including the level of outrageousness of the conduct required to hold the developers liable on the emotional distress claim and the reasonableness of the reliance required by the fraud claim. The erroneous instructions infected the entire trial and required the granting of a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had passed an ordinance pursuant to Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 50-1043 to 50-1049, seeking to collect local-option nonproperty taxes on liquor by the drink and on hotel-motel occupancy. The city imposed the tax upon the campground, and a lawsuit was filed, challenging the ordinance as inapplicable to campgrounds. The district court ruled that the ordinance was invalid to the extent that it imposed tax liability on campground owners until amended. Later, the amended ordinance was found to be valid by the district court. The city filed an action against the campground, claiming unpaid local option taxes for certain years, plus interest and penalties. The campground answered and counterclaimed that it was entitled to a setoff against the taxes that were paid under the invalid ordinance. The district court granted the city partial summary judgment and denied the campground's counterclaim. The court affirmed, holding that the campground owner failed to adhere to the procedures provided for in the ordinance to challenge the assessment, thus it was not error for the district court to refuse to review the assessment amount. Other arguments were not briefed properly, thus were not reviewed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Kootenai County, which rejected the mother's contention that Idaho Code &sect; 56-203B was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's daughter went to live with her father. While the daughter resided with him, the father received public assistance from the state. The state began billing the mother for the payments. The mother contended that &sect; 56-203B, which exempted assistance recipients from liability for child support paid by the state, unconstitutionally discriminated against parents, such as herself, who are eligible for, but did not apply to receive, such public welfare benefits. The court rejected the mother's equal protection contention. The court refused to apply the strict scrutiny test as to constitutionality of &sect; 56-203B. The mother had a fundamental right to make parenting decisions, but that did not require the state to relieve her of her obligation to support a child that resided with someone else. More importantly, the mother's failure to come within the statutory exemption resulted from her desire to avoid welfare. The statute was constitutional under the rational basis test. The statute manifested the legitimate interest of providing assistance to parents unable to provide for their children. This goal was rationally served by limiting the exemption to assistance recipients.</SPAN></P>
