</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioned for direct review of a Clark County Superior Court (Washington) decision that permanently enjoined it, and persons acting in concert with it, from entering respondent's retail premises for purposes of soliciting initiative signatures, in respondent's action for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an initiative signature gathering company, challenged an injunction against it, prohibiting the gathering of signatures on the property of respondent, a discount retailer. The court affirmed, balancing the competing interests of private property against the right to initiative petitioning under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1(a) (amend. 72), considering factors such as the nature and use of the property, the scope of the invitation extended to the public by the property owner, and the impact on the initiative process. Although the court recognized the narrow exception to a property owner's sovereignty in favor of initiative petition activities in shopping centers bearing the earmarks of a town square or public forum, the exception did not apply because respondent's stores bore none of the characteristics of a town center and respondent had never expressly invited the public into its store for any noncommercial purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision was affirmed. The narrow exception to a property owner's sovereignty in favor of initiative petition activities in shopping centers bearing the earmarks of a public forum did not apply because respondent's stores were not characteristic of a town center and respondent discouraged public activities in its store.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, rental property businesses, filed a class action against the City of Mukilteo, Washington (respondent) challenging the constitutionality of Mukilteo, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 5.04.070(A)(3). This ordinance imposed a residential dwelling unit (RDU) fee per dwelling unit in addition to the basic business licensing fee, regardless of whether the unit was currently being rented. The court held that the RDU fee was subject to the taxing provisions of the Washington Constitution. The incident of this tax was on rental property as such and a tax on rental property was no less a tax on property. The RDU tax violated Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, amend. 81's prohibition of non-uniform taxation of real property; violated the ad valorem requirement of Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2, amend. 79; and, because it was not authorized by statute, it was in excess of respondent's taxing authority. Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to respondent because the challenged residential dwelling unit tax violated the state constitutional prohibition of non-uniform taxation of real property, the ad valorem requirement, and was in excess of respondent's constitutional taxing authority because the tax was not authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) involuntarily committing appellant after a jury found appellant to be a sexually violent predator pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09. The state cross-appealed on the issue of burden of proof at show cause hearings under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involuntarily committed as a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09. The court held that: (1) the denial of appellant's motions to represent himself was proper; (2) the admission of evidence relating to appellant's prior rape victims was proper; (3) evidence of conditions at a particular facility were irrelevant; (4) the jury instructions were proper; (5) because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between SVPs and other mentally ill persons, annual commitment review hearings do not violate the equal protection clause; (6) refusing to seal the proceedings was proper; (7) because the conditions of appellant's confinement were not so punitive as to be criminal rather than civil, there was no double jeopardy; (8) the trial court's attempt to require review every 180 days was overruled; and (9) due process requires the state to bear the burden of proof in involuntary civil commitment hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of commitment affirmed; sexually violent predator statute was constitutional; trial court erroneously determined that annual review provision violated appellant's right to equal protection, therefore the imposition of reviews every 180 days was overruled; state bore the burden of proof in show cause hearings held pursuant to the statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant asserted conditions at the SCC were unconstitutional and that the statute under which he was committed was also unconstitutional. The motion was denied, although the trial court did find that certain conditions at SCC were unconstitutional. Appellant challenged the denial of the motion as well as several other trial court rulings. The court found that appellant failed to sufficiently prove the conditions of his confinement under sexual predator civil commitment statute constituted punishment so as to render that statute criminal in nature and unconstitutional as applied to him. None of appellant's other numerous allegations of error warranted reversal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the information was legally sufficient since it set forth the required elements of aggravated first-degree murder. Additionally, the court held that appellant's guilty pleas were valid since, before acceptance, the trial court created a record affirmatively showing that the pleas were knowing and voluntary. Furthermore, the court held that pursuant to &sect; 10.95.060(3), presentation of evidence regarding &quot;circumstances of the murder&quot; was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board, denied parole to petitioner, a convicted murderer, and extended his minimum term of imprisonment after it determined that he posed a threat to community safety and was not parolable. Respondent based its decision in part upon petitioner's refusal to admit responsibility for the underlying crime. Petitioner filed a personal restraint petition alleging that respondent violated petitioner's right against self-incrimination. After the lower court granted the petition, respondent sought discretionary review, which was granted. Upon review, the court held that respondent did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner's parol on the basis of its conclusion that he was not rehabilitated and that he posed a threat to community safety. The lower court erred in concluding that respondent's consideration of petitioner's denial of guilt violated his constitutional right against self-incrimination.

The orders were affirmed on appeal. Upon review, the court affirmed the orders. The court held that in applying Wash. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent convict was ordered to pay restitution for multiple convictions for arson. Before the period of restitution expired, the statute authorizing the restitution was amended to permit extension of the initial period of restitution orders, and appellant state applied to extend respondent's restitution period. Holding that the amendments did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, sec. 10, or Wash. Const. art. I, sec. 23, due process, or double jeopardy, the court reversed the judgment for respondent and remanded. The court held that, assuming restitution was penal in nature, the amendments did not increase the quantum of punishment ordered, but only the time appellant had to collect, and thus did not violate the ex post facto proscriptions. Similarly, the amendments were not bills of attainder since they did not inflict punishment. The court held that the amendments did not violate due process, because respondent had no vested property right to have his restitution order end at a particular time. Furthermore, extension of the restitution was not a &quot;direct consequence&quot; of his guilty plea, and thus the plea, made in the full knowledge of all direct consequences, was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a husband and wife and their wholly owned mortgage company, were found liable for 250 violations of the Mortgage Broker Practices Act, Wash.

Petitioners argued for the first time on appeal that the fine violated U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV, but the court dismissed the appeal, on a common-law doctrine of reviewability. On review, the court held that Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a), and not common-law governed the appeal, overruled the cases of Aripa v. Department of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., 91 Wash. 2d 135, 588 P.2d 185 (1978); Jones v. Industrial Elec.-Seattle, Inc., 53 Wash. App. 536, 768 P.2d 520 (1989), Department of Labor &amp; Indus. v.

The court explained that, in order to prove that a statute exceeded the state's police power, the person challenging the statute was required to overcome the presumption that the state intended to correct some evil or promote some interest of the state, and that the statute bore a reasonable and substantial relationship to accomplishing its purpose. The court found that the statute did bear a reasonable and substantial relationship to accomplishing its purpose: to protect the public interest, and concluded that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the legislature's police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI). At issue on appeal was whether it was constitutionally permissible for the trial court to admit evidence that a DUI defendant such as respondent refused to perform field sobriety tests (FST). Specifically, the question was whether admitting such evidence violated respondent's U.S. Const. amend. V right against self-incrimination. The court concluded that respondent's refusal to perform the field sobriety test (FST) was neither non-testimonial evidence nor compelled by the state. Thus, U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment admitting into evidence respondent's refusal to perform field sobriety tests where the admission of such evidence in respondent's trial for driving under the influence was neither compelled by the government nor testimonial in nature, and thus did not implicate respondent's constitutional right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court decision upholding respondent city's decision to deny petitioner corporations' application for a conditional use permit to build a rooftop helistop for purposes related to its business operations. Reviewing respondent's decision de novo, the court found nothing wrong with respondent's conclusion that the helistop could not be permitted under the conditional use ordinance at issue because it was not a necessary or integral element of the service provided by petitioners. Defining &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;integral&quot; according to their dictionary definitions, the court found that the helistop was merely a business convenience. Legitimate concerns with safety and noise associated with the helistop remained despite mitigation efforts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted as a sexually violent predator and committed to the custody of the Washington Department of Social and Health Services. The issues were whether a person so committed was entitled to an appeal as of right or whether he or she must file a motion for discretionary review, and whether the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to invalidate an annual evaluation of his condition. The court held that where a trial court found in a hearing under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090(2) no probable cause to believe that a violent sexual predator's condition had changed, an appellate court reviewed such a decision under the provisions of Wash. R. App. P. 2.3(b). The court granted discretionary review and decided the case on its merits, concluding that the evidence supported the finding that no probable cause existed to support a change in condition that would warrant appellant's release from custody. Appellant failed to demonstrate that his evaluation was invalid either because the evaluator did not examine him personally or because he was denied the presence of counsel at the examination.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner had challenged two statutes,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.265(1), 69.50.420(1), which classified him as a &quot;juvenile,&quot; although he was 19 years of age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner entered a guilty plea to a charge of possession of marijuana. The trial court sent notice of petitioner's conviction to the Washington Department of Licensing. Upon receipt of the notice, the department suspended petitioner's driver's license pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.265(1). Petitioner, who was 19 years of age at the time, won injunctive relief in the trial court, staying the order revoking his driver's license. The court of appeals dissolved the injunction. The Washington Supreme Court affirmed, holding that Washington law required trial courts to notify the department as to certain violations of law by &quot;juveniles&quot; 13 years of age or older and under the age of 21. The court further held that the word &quot;juvenile&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.265(1) took the same definition as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.420(1), the statute under which the trial court referred the matter to the department. The court concluded that the two statutes at issue did not offend equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his sentence of death and his underlying convictions for two murders. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in its decision to have him shackled throughout the trial and special sentencing proceedings and handcuffed during certain testimony. The court found that defendant was never disruptive in court, he was not an escape risk, and he posed no threat to anyone during the court proceedings. Therefore, there was no manifest need for restraining defendant and the trial court's decision to use restraints was clearly an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, defendant's conviction was affirmed because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming and any reasonable jury would have reached the same result in the absence of the trial court's error. However, the presence of defendant in physical restraints indicated to the jury that his character was dangerous and prejudiced him in such a manner that warranted a reversal of his death sentence. Accordingly, the jury's sentence of death was reversed and remanded for a new special sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a group of out-of-state corporate taxpayers that successfully challenged state taxes they had paid as constitutionally defective, challenged orders of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), upholding the constitutionality of the multiple activities tax credit (MATC), 1987 Wash. Laws &sect; 3, and holding that it was properly applied retroactively to cure problems with the prior invalidated tax scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant out-of-state corporations challenged a trial court order holding them liable for unpaid tax assessments in actions for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages against appellee state government and officials, alleging appellees were seeking to collect unconstitutional taxes. Appellants were among a group of 71 corporate taxpayers that successfully challenged state taxes they had paid as violative of the Commerce Clause, winning a United States Supreme Court ruling that partially invalidated the tax scheme as constitutionally defective. In response, the state enacted a two-way credit law designed to eliminate the constitutional defects. Appellants challenged the retroactive application of the two-way credit law to an &quot;interim period&quot; from the date the prior tax scheme was invalidated to enactment of the new law, claiming retrospective application discriminated against interstate commerce and violated equal protection principles and their rights to due process of law. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed the orders, holding that the retroactive application of the remedial legislation called for by the law did not offend constitutional principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court judgments on the key points because the fact that the United States Supreme Court had declared that a tax scheme was partially and impermissibly discriminatory did not in itself dictate the relief that defendants must provide, and retroactive application of the new state law satisfied the requirements of federal due process as a post-deprivation remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pled guilty to theft and attempted theft. At sentencing, the state asserted petitioner's offender score was 11. Petitioner offered a calculation of eight. The difference centered around three California convictions. At the sentencing hearing, the state orally asserted the convictions would be classified as felonies under comparable Washington law, without presenting evidence of any kind. The court decided the offenses were felony convictions, and sentenced petitioner to the greater term. On appeal, petitioner argued that the state failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the convictions were comparable to Washington felonies. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court. The supreme court reversed and held that a challenge to the classification of out-of-state convictions, like other sentencing errors resulting in unlawful sentences, could be raised for the first time on appeal. In the present case, the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that the disputed convictions would be classified as felonies under Washington law. The offender score used to calculate the proper standard range was incorrect and the sentence was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murder and received a death sentence. The trial court determined that no juror had improper contact with any member of the victim's family during the sentencing phase of the trial. Petitioner filed a personal restraint petition challenging this finding and contending that he was entitled to either a new trial or the vacation of his death sentence. The court denied the petition. The prosecution's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence, which would have provided petitioner with impeachment material against prisoners testifying on behalf of the prosecution, did not preclude a fair trial. Petitioner's trial counsel was not ineffective where counsel cross-examined and impeached the prisoners and chose not to retain additional experts who could give negligible assistance. The ultimate jury instruction in the sentencing phase, while slightly differently worded from the prescription of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.060(4), was not confusing. The admission of victim impact evidence did not violate the prohibition on ex post facto laws. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that no juror misconduct occurred during the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned three adjacent parcels of land; the entire area was transected by the dividing line between port commissioner districts one and two. The county auditor informed appellant that she resided within district one for purposes of voter registration and candidacy. Voters elected appellant to the office of port commissioner for district one. The trial court set aside the election on the ground that appellant's house did not sit upon the portion of the land within district one but instead occupied land within district two, and that appellant thus did not reside within district one as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 53.12.010(1)(a). On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the intent of &sect; 53.12.010(1)(a) did not support such a narrow reading. Because the judiciary was historically obliged to refrain from invalidating elections, public policy favored eligibility, appellant complied in good faith with all applicable regulations, and appellant treated the three parcels as one large area, the court upheld the election result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the annulment of the election results and entered judgment for appellant; the court found that the election was valid because eligibility of candidates was to be favored, the court was to construe the statute liberally, and appellant fulfilled all statutory obligations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court, Yakima County (Washington) that convicted him of obstructing a police officer in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.020(1) and possession of drug paraphernalia after his motion to suppress evidence was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a vehicle involved in a legitimate traffic stop. Defendant exited and walked away. The police ordered him to stop, but he ran away. The police caught him, searched him incident to the arrest, and found a marijuana pipe. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the marijuana pipe, which was denied by the trial court. Defendant was convicted of obstructing a police officer in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.020(1) and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant appealed. The court reversed because a stop based on a traffic violation did not provide an officer with grounds to require identification of the passengers in the car. While police officers could have controlled the scene for their own safety, they were required to protect the privacy interests of the passengers. Because the police did not articulate facts that reasonably suggested a problematic situation that warranted stopping defendant from leaving, and the police had no probable cause to suspect defendant of having committed a crime, the police did not have probable cause to search defendant and the evidence obtained in that search should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant and denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence was reversed and remanded because a stop based on a traffic violation did not provide the officer with grounds to require identification of the passengers in the car, and when defendant fled, there were no articulated reasons that warranted the police to stop defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, sought a declaratory judgment that defendant mortgage company engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by producing and completing residential home loan documents. They argued that such unauthorized practice of law violated the Consumer Protection Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.86. Both parties moved for summary judgment, which was granted in favor of defendant. The trial court held that charging a fee for the production and completion of residential loan documents was not the unauthorized practice of law where lay persons involved in the process did not exercise legal discretion. Plaintiffs sought review in the appeals court, and respondent sought direct review by the court, which was granted. The court affirmed and held that the trial court balanced the competing interests of protecting the public from the harm of the lay exercise of legal discretion and of promoting convenience and low cost. The court noted that where lay persons selected and completed form legal documents by entering objective data, those actions were unlikely to result in the uncertain legal rights with which the court was concerned. Thus, the risk of public harm was low.</SPAN></P>

The team affiliate filed a motion to strike portions of the citizen's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged legislation submitted for a referendum the issue of whether counties should be allowed to create public stadium authorities which could then contract with a professional football team for development of a new stadium and exhibition center. The legislation also stated it would be null and void unless the football team affiliate agreed to reimburse the state and counties for the cost of the special election to be held on the referendum. On appeal, the court held that the legislature did not transfer its legislative functions or the governor's veto powers to others by conditioning the operative effect of the legislation on the football team affiliate's payment of the election costs. The court held that the legislation was not unconstitutional special legislation, because it applied to classes, the counties and any affiliates of any national football league team. The court also ruled that the citizen's rights to political speech and equal protection were not violated by the scheduling of the election so soon after the legislation's passage.</SPAN></P>

The parents had a fundamental, constitutionally protected right to autonomy in child rearing decisions. The court remanded to the trial courts to determine whether the friends or family members had established sufficient financial need to warrant an award of attorney fees and costs on appeal.

Appellants objected that eminent domain could not be exercised where the anticipated use of the condemned property included private use. The trial court adjudicated public use and necessity that authorized the state to exercise its eminent domain power. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the use was primarily public, the public interest required it, and the property appropriated was necessary for the public purpose. The court found that the private use was not so combined with the public use that the two could not be separated, and found further that the state was not seeking to condemn more land than was needed for the public expansion project.

The superior court held that the repealed statute violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, but in a declaratory ruling, granted taxpayers only prospective relief. Both parties directly appealed that decision. Taxpayers contended that they were entitled to retroactive relief in the form of a refund of &quot;taxes&quot; paid. The State contended that the former statute was valid under the Commerce Clause, as the regulatory fee was not a tax and did not discriminate against interstate commerce. Any holding of unconstitutionality should be prospective only. On appeal, the court reversed the order, finding that the repealed statute imposed a constitutional regulatory fee, not a tax, and did not violate the Commerce Clause.

Here, providing PERC jurisdiction over wage related issues was within the ambit of the county legislative authority and did not violate separation of powers. The Act regulated specific aspects of employment in the public sector, such as collective bargaining and wage disputes, that did not affect those functions traditionally within the judicial branch. Under the Act, the district court retained the power to collectively bargain and contract over working conditions. The court's resistance to bargaining or resolving disputes with employees through the procedures under the Act was not enough to show a violation of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in a work-related, two-car accident with the driver, and received industrial insurance benefits from the department. The employee was notified that he could pursue a claim against the driver himself or that the department would pursue the action for him. The employee did not respond to the letter, and the third party action was assigned to the department, which accepted a settlement offer from the driver's insurer and released the driver from liability. The employee did not object to the settlement and accepted the settlement funds. The employee then filed an action against the driver, and the department intervened. The trial court granted summary judgment for the driver and the department. The appellate court reversed, ruling that the department's letter was not a demand under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.070(1). On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the certified letter complied with the statute and did not violate the employee's due process rights. The court concluded that the letter was not too vague to constitute a demand as required by the statute and that, because the employee did not read the letter anyway, the issue was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In petitioner accused murderer's trial, the trial court granted respondent state's motion in limine to exclude expert testimony of diminished capacity and denied petitioner's motion to admit the testimony. The court reversed the trial court's order, holding that it was error to exclude expert testimony on diminished capacity prior to trial on a motion in limine in a case of aggravated first degree murder in which respondent intended to ask for the death penalty. The court refused to adopt the foundational requirements of State v. Edmon as absolute; that the trial court did so unconstitutionally deprived petitioner before trial of his due process right to present a diminished capacity defense, and constituted an abuse of discretion. There was sufficient basis in the record to allow expert testimony on diminished capacity at trial during the guilt phase. The trial court unreasonably and prematurely concluded that the foundation for admissibility had not been satisfied; it should have considered admissibility under Wash. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was sentenced to death for aggravated first-degree murder. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. He then filed personal restraint petition and an amended petition, which the court denied. It found that representation of counsel, a public defender, was not ineffective based on any actual or alleged conflict arising from the representation by counsel and the public defender's office, in separate matters, of some of the state's witnesses, as petitioner told the trial court he wanted counsel to continue representation and did not establish a conflict affected counsel's performance. Petitioner also failed to provide evidence that there were undisclosed inducements given to jail inmates in exchange for their testimony and, even if such evidence was shown, petitioner's own testimony confirmed much of the inmates' testimony. Further, petitioner's constitutional rights were not violated by his absence from in-chambers conferences between the trial court and counsel as all but one involved legal matters. The one conference that required petitioner's presence was subsequently heard on the record in petitioner's presence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the employer corporation's owners failed to prove that the failure to pay the wages resulted from mere &quot;carelessness&quot; or that a bona fide dispute existed regarding the amount of back wages, in order to negate the necessary willfulness under Wash.

The employer corporation's owners failed to articulate any standard for such &quot;financial inability&quot; and the court concluded that the failure to pay the employee was willful in the absence of a clearly demarcated test for financial inability to pay. The court declined to create an exception judicially to the double damages provision of &sect; 49.52.070 for financial inability to pay wages due because the plain language of &sect; 49.52.070 was to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.350(3) violated appellant patient's negligence action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that her doctor negligently administered radiation treatment to the patient's eyes and that the medical center was liable for the malpractice under a theory of corporate negligence. The patient alleged that she learned of the injuries between 15 and 16 years after the radiation treatment. The court found that the eight-year applicable statute of repose, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.350(3), violated the privileges and immunities clause of the Washington State Constitution. The court found that a heightened scrutiny standard was not justified in the case, and the court used the rational basis analysis applicable to the Equal Protection Clause. Using that standard, the court found that there were non-arbitrary reasons that the statute of repose did not apply uniformly to all persons who discovered their malpractice claims over eight years after the malpractice occurred. However, the classification of medical malpractice claims subject to the statute did not bear a rational relationship to the purpose of the statute. The purpose of the statute was to protect insurance companies. However, the statute could not avert or resolve a malpractice insurance crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county assessors challenged the constitutionality of Referendum 47, which changed the method of assessing real property for purposes of levying property taxes. The county assessors argued that the new scheme violated the uniformity requirement of the Washington Constitution and unfairly shifted the tax burden from owners of rapidly appreciating property to owners of property which was staying more stable in value or which was depreciating in value. The court held that the taxing scheme violated the uniformity requirement of the Washington Constitution because the value averaging created different assessment ratios for real property which, under Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, were one class of property. The court disagreed with the Director of the Washington Department of Revenue's position and held that value averaging was an assessment formula and was not an &quot;exemption&quot; from taxation. The court declined to extend the equal protection analysis to the referendum. The court granted the county assessors' petition for a writ of mandamus and ordered the Director of the Washington Department of Revenue to calculate the assessment ratios for real property without regard to Referendum 47.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent peat mining operation brought an action against petitioner Snohomish County, challenging a decision of the county hearing examiner that the mining operation had to obtain a grading permit for its excavation and fill activities. The superior court reversed on the ground that because the mining operation established a nonconforming use, the permit was not required. The Court of Appeals (Washington) affirmed. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a complaint regarding excessive ponding on neighboring property, the county initiated an investigation into the mining operation that resulted in charges of code violations including grading without the necessary permits and approvals required under Snohomish County, Wash., Code &sect; 17.04.280. The mining operation filed an appeal. The hearing examiner found that the mining operation had established a valid nonconforming use. However, the mining operation was subject to police power regulations including the code provision requiring a grading permit. The mining operation thereafter pursued judicial review of the hearing examiner's decision. On appeal, the court held that: (1) although the mining operation was a valid nonconforming use that did not require a general conditional use permit, the mining operation was not exempt from all other specific permitting requirements, even if they regulated some of the same operations; and (2) the mining operation's nonconforming use was subject to the county's later enacted grading permit requirement, which was a reasonable police power regulation enacted to protect the health and safety of the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment from the court of appeals and reinstated the hearing examiner's decision that the mining operation was subject to the grading permit requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Whatcom County (Washington) which granted summary judgment to respondent corporation and boat owners who had argued that an ordinance appellant had passed was not a valid exercise of police power. The trial court also issued a judgment declaring the ordinance invalid, unconstitutional, void and of no force and effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county had passed an ordinance that banned the use of motorized personal watercraft, subject to certain limited exceptions, on all marine waters and one lake in that county. The court was asked to determine whether that ordinance was unconstitutional or violative of the public trust doctrine. The court concluded that it was neither and, consequently, reversed the trial court's judgment that the ordinance was void and of no force and effect and remanded for entry of an order granting appellant's motion for summary judgment. The court found that the ordinance did not conflict, for the purposes of Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11, any other applicable state statutes, or the public trust doctrine. The ordinance was reasonably necessary to further appellant's legitimate public purposes and not unduly oppressive; it is a reasonable exercise of the county's police power and not inconsistent with respondents' due process rights. The court was unable to consider respondents' vagueness claim because it constituted a facial challenge not implicating First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9A.46.110 (1993), and sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals, Division I (Washington), which affirmed decisions by the trial courts concluding the statute defining the crime of &quot;stalking,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and did not violate constitutional due process. Defendants' cases had been consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants repeatedly followed a different woman as she tried to go about her business and refused to cease such conduct upon request. On appeal, defendants argued that the stalking statute was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, and violated constitutional requirements of procedural due process. The State contended it had a legitimate interest in restraining harmful conduct and may do so under the police powers which promote the health, safety and welfare of the public. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the stalking statute, was not void for vagueness, was not unconstitutionally overbroad and did not violate constitutional requirements of due process. The court held that the stalking statute did not interfere with one's legitimate freedom of movement or right to travel, but applied to conduct between two or more persons when one wishes to be left alone and to be free of interference by the other. The statute was a reasonable exercise of the police powers in protecting privacy interests of a segment of society from invasive oppressive behavior and harmful conduct. The court also held that the evidence in both cases was sufficient to justify the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Thus, it infringed on speech protected by the First Amendment and usurped the right of the electorate to determine the merits of political initiatives without fear of government sanction. This imposition upon political expression was not justified because the state did not carry its heavy burden of proving that the statute served a compelling interest or that the statute was necessary to serve that interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 provided greater protection than U.S. Const. amend.

The court affirmed the conviction and the appellate court decision, holding that the confrontation clauses in U.S. Const. amend. VI, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 were sufficiently similar to provide the identical protection and that the right of confrontation by a face-to-face meeting was not absolute and could be modified, as by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.150, to protect the interests of a child victim, who would suffer emotional distress from having to testify in the presence of defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, because the procedure of allowing the child victim to testify by television rather than in a face-to-face provided defendant with adequate protection of his constitutional right to confrontation, while at the same time providing the child victim the protection from suffering from the emotional stress of facing defendant.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9.94A.120(9)(c) to monitor compliance with other conditions of community placement. The court found that the trial court could require sex offenders to undergo plethysmograph testing as part of a treatment program imposed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(9)(c)(iii). However, the trial court could not order plethysmograph testing unless it also required crime-related treatment for sexual deviancy. &quot;No contact&quot; orders were authorized by Wash. Rev.

The state and community council assigned error to the summary judgment in favor of the county, which raised issues whether the statute: constituted a special law granting corporate powers or privileges for municipal purposes; granted privileges to a class of citizens which did not apply equally to all similarly situated citizens; revised other pre-existing statutory provisions without setting forth the text of the provisions; violated Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect;. 4; and violated the one-person, one-vote requirement of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that the act violated the state constitution. When considering the purpose of the statute, to provide an island community with a method to give direct input on the planning and zoning of their community to the county legislative authority and to serve as a forum for the discussion of local issues, the court was unable to conclude that the exclusion of all other island communities was rational.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision and held that the justice's brief appearance at the rally to express his belief in the preservation and protection of innocent human life and to thank his supporters in the crowd for his election to office did not lead to a clear conclusion that he was, as a result, not impartial on the issue as it might present itself to him in his role as a judge. The court concluded that there was nothing in the record that permitted the court to construe the justice's conduct as an express or implied promise to decide particular issues in a particular way or as an indication that he would be unwilling or unable to be impartial and follow the law if faced with a case in which abortion issues were presented.</SPAN></P>

The patient brought a malpractice action against the physician in which she claimed that the physician's negligence proximately caused the heart attack and stroke. The trial court granted the physician's motion for a summary judgment of dismissal on the grounds that the statute of limitations barred the patient's action. On appeal, the patient contended that the three-year statute of limitations period commenced to run only when the cause of action accrued and that the cause of action did not accrue until she was injured. The physician contended that the three-year period began to run from the date of the claimed wrongful act or omission and not from the date of injury. The court held (1) the three-year period in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16503 began to run from the date of the claimed act or omission that caused the injury, (2) equitable tolling of the statute of limitations was not appropriate because the patient was not prevented by any positive rule of law from filing within one year of her discovery of her cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant challenged the use of his previous court-martial in his sentencing. The actions were consolidated to determine whether the general courts-martial qualified as a prior criminal conviction under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A. The court held that a general court-martial constituted prior criminal convictions. The court held that defendants' prior court-martial convictions qualified as &quot;strikes&quot; under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act. Laws of 1994. The court held that the first defendant was tried and found guilty by a military judge. The second defendant pleaded guilty to the crimes for which he was court-martialed. The court held that the proceedings were convictions which were to be considered by sentencing judges. The court held that the courts-martial met the statutory definition of a conviction pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(9).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sheriff department employed the law enforcement officer. He was injured and received workers' compensation benefits under the Industrial Insurance Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51. The officer filed the instant action, arguing that his injury was caused by the negligence of the county sheriff department. The appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal because the Washington Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System Act (LEOFF) granted Plan II members the right to sue their employers for negligence in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.280 (1971). The court reviewed the legislative history of the amendments to LEOFF and concluded that Plan II members were eligible for industrial insurance benefits. The 1971 amendment giving all police officers and fire fighters the right to sue their employers for negligence, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.280 (1971), was not removed in successive legislative amendments. The court read the clear and unambiguous language without unnecessary judicial interpretation.

That decision was reversed when the lower court found that the stepfather was liable for support under Wash. Rev.

However, the stepfather's third challenge resulted in a ruling in his favor. The reviewing court found that &sect; 26.16.205 was ambiguous. Thus, the court looked to legislative intent and determined that the statute did not impose a child support obligation on a stepparent equal to that of the child's parents and that the statute did not provide the only means of ending obligations created under &sect; 26.16.205. The court found that the stepfather was not primarily liable for the support of the children after they were placed with their father. The court reasoned that the child support schedule and standards set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.19 governed all child support determinations in the state.</SPAN></P>

The lower court awarded judgment to plaintiffs on their state law claims. On appeal by both parties, the court held that Wash. Rev.

The court found that the DSHS had failed to comply with the statute. The court further held that the general structure and purpose of the dependency statute, Wash. Rev.

Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of insurable interest. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondents and awarded them attorney fees. The Court of Appeals of Washington partially reversed the judgment and affirmed the award of attorney fees. Petitioner sought discretionary review of the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents entered into an agreement to purchase a home. They began to make improvements to the home but before they could obtain long-term financing, a fire destroyed the home. The court concluded that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, while holding that their insurable interest was limited to the improvements they made to the property. The court found that respondents did not purchase the property and that the evidence prior to the fire was insufficient to show, under the clear and convincing standard, that the deed from the property owner to the loan broker, absolute on its face, was intended as a security device for any indebtedness on respondent's part. Thus, they were not entitled to recover whatever insurance proceeds would be due based upon the value of the house at the time it was destroyed. The court found no equal protection or privileges and immunities violations with respect to the award of attorney fees. The rule that an insured who prevailed in a dispute over coverage was entitled to attorney fees from the insurer was a legitimate attempt to balance the one-sidedness of the ordinary insurer-policyholder relationship.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court which had determined that none of the criminal charges had been properly dismissed. The court remanded the case for trial. The court determined that a violation of &sect; 10.79.040 occurred whenever there had been an unconstitutional search, whether the officer acted in good faith or bad faith. Defendant's contention that the state lacked insufficient evidence for the unlawful search charge was without merit. The court held that defendant was not immune from criminal liability on the basis that he reasonably believed his conduct was lawful in order to protect police property and under an emergency exception to the warrant requirement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers, the city, and the public development authority entered a plan to renovate and expand a downtown parking garage at a shopping mall owned by the developers. The city adopted an ordinance authorizing the city's support for the garage. The activists filed suit against the city and the public development authority, and the developers intervened. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly rejected the activists' challenge to the ordinance. The court reasoned that the city complied with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.86.050 by holding hearings and by establishing that the garage conformed to the city's comprehensive plan. Furthermore, the city was authorized to purchase the garage under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.86.010. The activists' allegation that the city failed to comply with the State Environmental Policy Act, at Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21C, was properly dismissed because the activists failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit. The court also found that the ordinance did not violate the public purpose requirement of Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 because the city determined that the project would confer various public benefits.</SPAN></P>

On appeal by the state, the court held that the case law that provided that a civil forfeiture was punishment for the purposes of federal and state double jeopardy analysis had been overruled by a United States Supreme Court case. The civil forfeiture was not punishment for purposes of the state constitution because the legislature clearly intended that he forfeiture was remedial and not punitive.

During a search incident to defendant's arrest, heroin was discovered, defendant was eventually convicted of a drug possession offense, and that conviction was affirmed. Defendant appealed and the court reversed. The court noted that pedestrian infractions were generally classified, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.63.020, as traffic infractions rather than criminal offenses. The court also noted that the Seattle municipal code followed the same approach. The court determined that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.021 permitted a police officer to engage in certain activities incident to a traffic infraction, but the statute did not permit the officer to conduct a warrant check. The court found that Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 11.31.010, 11.59.090 were to the same effect. As a result, the court concluded that, because the police officer had no authority to conduct the warrant check, the arrest, or the search, the heroin was improperly seized and required suppression.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled the confession was voluntary and admissible and sentenced defendant within the standard sentence range with the deadly weapon enhancement, a total sentence of 99 months. Defendant contended that an enhanced firearm initiative did not satisfy the title and single subject requirement of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 and that his confession was not admissible. The court affirmed the conviction because the confession was voluntary and properly submitted to the jury. The court also found that the initiative's legislative title contained only one subject, increased penalties for armed crimes, and the other provisions that violated the constitution were severable. The court remanded the judgment for resentencing because the trial court failed to include a period of community placement.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court held that: (1) the statutory element of having a purpose to stimulate the viewer sexually, combined with the exhibition, ensured that the statute was not overbroad; (2) the legitimate reach of the statute far surpassed whatever impermissible application the statute might reach; (3) admission of the videotaped picnic scenes was not error where defendant withdrew any objection to its admission or never objected at all; and (4) where the jury could have inferred the requisite criminal intent from defendant's conduct, there was substantial evidence to convict.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the appellate court's reversal of the conviction. Defendant's conduct, while contemptible, did not fall within the prohibitions of the sexual exploitation of minors statute. In order to have convicted defendant under the statute the state was required to have shown some affirmative act of assistance, interaction, influence, or communication on the part of a defendant, which initiated and resulted in a child's display of sexually explicit conduct.</SPAN></P>

After agreeing to an evidentiary hearing, the state moved to strike the hearing based on a recent Washington Supreme Court ruling. The trial court denied the hearing, and petitioner's request for discretionary review by the court of appeals was denied. The court granted discretionary review and affirmed the court of appeals' denial of discretionary review. The petitioner had standing to challenge the state's right to try him as a sexually violent predator. The trial court correctly denied an evidentiary hearing based on the supreme court's ruling that sexually violent predator proceedings were civil in nature and not subject to double jeopardy or ex post facto challenges. The supreme court also concluded that the Community Protection Act was facially constitutional. Until petitioner was committed, the constitutionality of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the superior court's judgment that applicable provisions of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50, deprived respondent cancer patient of access to marijuana for medicinal purposes in violation of the state constitution. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.204(c)(14), which categorized marijuana under schedule I, thereby making it illegal for all uses other than research, did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 32. Applying the six Gunwall factors, the court first found that the protections provided under the state Privileges and Immunities Clause, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, were coextensive with the federal Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court then ruled that the rational basis standard of review was appropriate, and that under that standard, the classification of marijuana as on schedule I, pursuant to &sect; 69.50(c)(14), did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court further decided that the Frequent Recurrence to Fundamental Principles Analysis, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 32, did not provide a substantive right to the medicinal use of marijuana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped, tortured, and murdered a 21-year-old female. He stole her money to finance a trip to Palm Springs, California, where he raped another young woman and slit her throat. He made statements to police detectives in Palm Springs that were recorded without his knowledge. In his statements, he related in a calm, graphic manner, and with specific detail, a narrative of his activities. A rational trier of fact could have found that leniency was not merited. Considering such a heinous crime, a difficult childhood and troubled family life was not sufficient mitigation to deserve leniency. The death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. The death verdict was not based upon passion or prejudice. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting the testimony of the California victim under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b). There was no violation of double jeopardy. The Palm Springs police lawfully and independently recorded defendant's statements under California law. The statements were therefore admissible at trial even though similar action violated Washington law. Sufficient authority allowed for death qualifying the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the support requirement of &sect; 4.24.010 violated the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), Wash.

The ERA prohibited classification based on sex, unless the classification was based upon: 1) the actual differences between the sexes; or 2) designed to alleviate effects of past discrimination. However, the differential treatment accorded mothers and fathers of illegitimate children was not based upon the actual differences between the sexes. Further, the court held that the father had standing to challenge the support requirement, because it limited his ability, only, to participate in the wrongful death action. Indeed, both parents of legitimate children and mothers of illegitimate children were provided with an unfettered cause of action. In its opinion, the court noted that the ERA was stronger than federal equal protection in regards to sex discrimination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the trial court ruling in defendant's favor, the court found &sect; 10.64.025(2) constitutional under both the separation of powers doctrine and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As to separation of powers, the court found &sect; 10.64.025(2) did not directly conflict with a court rule which gave the trial court discretion regarding release or bail. On the equal protection claim, the court found that because neither a suspect class, semi-suspect class, or fundamental right was at issue the rational relationship test applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a resident at a juvenile detention facility, the minor slapped a peer, set a fire in his room, and made unwanted physical contact with the staff.

The secretaries approved the transfer. The trial court certified the class as current and future juveniles incarcerated at a Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration facility. It granted summary judgment for the minor, which the court reversed. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.280 did not deprive the right to a jury trial because there was no such right in juvenile proceedings. Section 13.40.280 did not convert a juvenile proceeding into a criminal proceeding because the basis of the custody did not change. Even if the place of confinement changed, the benefits of the juvenile system remained, such as record expungement and population segregation. Section 13.40.280 did not violate equal protection because transferred juveniles retained juvenile protections, and therefore were not in the same class as declined juveniles.</SPAN></P>

The court below held that RISA allowed a private cause of action only for penalties for excess service charges and not for disclosure violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the parties raised numerous issues, the court found two issues dispositive. The court held that the 1992 legislation that deregulated service charges under RISA was retroactive. Thus, the court agreed with the corporation's position that, because the 1992 legislation repealed the maximum rates in place prior to the amendment, any contracted-for rates lawful under the new legislation were valid even if the transaction violated the law when entered into. There was no vested right in the ceilings on the rate of interest, and the legislature's use of the word &quot;shall&quot; indicated a mandatory directive, rather than prospective, application. The court declined to find an affirmative cause of action under RISA for other than excess service charges. The language of the statute did not provide a basis for such a cause of action, nor was implication of such an action warranted given the legislative history to the contrary. Further, a cause of action was not to be implied where the legislature had provided an adequate remedy in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was no rational basis to treat defendants under pretrial electronic home detention and defendants under post-trial electronic home detention differently regarding jail time credit. Before conviction, defendants were placed under home detention to protect the community and assure their presence at trial.

All parties appealed and the court granted review of the consolidated cases to consider whether it was unconstitutional double jeopardy for petitioner state to prosecute respondents when the department had previously issued each respondent a probationary license. The court concluded that the administrative issuance of probationary licenses was not punishment under the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two adult cabarets and three dancers, challenged the constitutionality of a city ordinance that regulated such establishments, under both the First Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The Superior Court of King County (Washington) upheld the ordinance except for one of its provisions. It also dissolved a temporary restraining order and awarded attorneys' fees to respondent city. Cross-appeals were filed by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constitutionality of the city's regulation of adult cabarets was challenged. The court stated that Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, justified enhanced protection in the context of adult entertainment regulations that imposed prior restraints. However, a similar enhancement was not warranted with regard to provisions that constituted restrictions on the time, place, or manner of such activity. Those principles led the court to find that the 14-day period for processing managers' licenses was an invalid prior restraint because it made no provision for temporary licenses. However, the provisions that prescribed a minimum distance between customers and dancers, as well as those that regulated lighting and business hours, were a legitimate exercise of the city's police powers because they furthered its interest in controlling the secondary effects of adult entertainment. The court limited the scope of another provision to displays or graphic representations of nudity outside of adult cabarets so as to eliminate its possible application to nude artistic works. The city was entitled to the attorneys' fees that it incurred prior to the dissolution of the a temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the judgment that upheld the 14 day processing period for a managers' license. The court also reversed the portion that invalidated the outdoor prohibition. It upheld that trial court's decision to award the city the attorneys' fees it incurred prior to the trial court's dissolution of the temporary restraining order, but remanded for a determination of the amount. The decision was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The parties argued whether the &quot;Youth Education Program&quot; (YEP) was a school within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.406. The court held that by giving a special verdict form that explicitly stated that YEP was a school the trial court violated Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court also found that defendants were denied due process when their sentences were enhanced based upon their proximity to school grounds, the location of which could not be ascertained by any readily accessible means. The court stated that although defendants' actual lack of knowledge of the protected zone around YEP was irrelevant to culpability, a readily available means by which they or others of ordinary intelligence could have determined the existence of the protected school zone was a constitutional necessity. Because YEP was not readily ascertainable as a school, defendants' enhanced sentences were vacated.</SPAN></P>

Appellant asserted that the trial court erred in dismissing its cause of action and sought an injunction to halt respondent's fundraising activities. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and reversed the court of appeal's reversal and remand because the court found that the chaplaincy program satisfied both Wash. Const. art.

The county assessed the city for property taxes on the stadium, which the city paid under protest. The city then filed a complaint for to recover the taxes paid. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, an ordered a refund of 49 percent of the taxes paid by the city. The county appealed the trial court's ruling. The city cross-appealed on the ground that the stadium was completely tax exempt. The court ruled that the title to the stadium did not mean that the city had complete ownership, but that the city had a 49 percent ownership interest in the stadium. Because the city was exempt from property taxes for its ownership interest in the stadium under Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, and Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant married couple and petitioner tort victim sought review of judgments in favor of appellee tort victim and respondents, married couple, in consolidated appeals from separate decisions which decided whether a victim of a tort committed by a married person in his separate capacity could execute a judgment based on the tort claim against the tortfeasor's interest in community real property. The court concluded the answer to the question was yes and affirmed in favor of appellee tort victim and reversed in favor of petitioner tort victim. The court explained the former exemption from separate torts that applied to community property often produced illogical and unjust results due to courts' inability to consistently determine whether the tortfeasor spouse's actions served to benefit the community. The court further noted the exemption arose at a time when the community was viewed as a distinct legal entity apart from the spouses who composed it. The court reasoned policy considerations strongly favored allowing a creditor to execute against the tortfeasor's community property interest because the law should not immunize tort-feasors absent express statutory provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee tort victim and reversed judgment in favor of petitioner tort victim because both tort victims were entitled to execute their respective judgments against appellant married couple and respondents, married couple.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer, a self-insured parent corporation, had paid the employee for medical and time-loss benefits for the workplace injury.

The appellate court, in reversing the trial court, reasoned that a self-insured parent corporation was not, as a matter of law, the employer of employees working for a subsidiary. The court held that the IIA created the employer's obligations to the employee and that having fulfilled its obligation under the IIA to provide the employee relief, the employer was correspondingly entitled to immunity from all civil actions and causes of action stemming from the employee's injury. In addition, the court held that &sect; 296-15-023(2) passed all of the statutory tests and was, therefore, valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer needed agency approval to appropriate groundwater for its development. When the agency delayed that decision until it conducted a watershed assessment of all applications, the developer filed a writ of mandamus. The trial court ordered the agency to expedite the developer's permit application and found the agency engaged in improper rulemaking. The agency appealed, arguing the ruling violated the rights of senior water right applicants, intruded on the funding decisions of the legislature, and interfered with the agency's administrative discretion to implement the water resource statutes. The court found the agency was faced with a large number of permit applications. The watershed assessment would aid the agency in expediting all permit applications and the agency had received funding specifically for a watershed assessment. Therefore, the agency's decision to delay the developer's permit was not a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). However, its decision to create procedures and priorities were new requirements or qualifications which required the agency to conduct APA rule-making procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant legislature and respondent governor both appealed summary judgment entered by the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington). After the governor vetoed certain legislation, the legislature filed a declaratory judgment seeking to invalidate the vetoes and asking the court to construe the governor's veto authority under Wash. Const. art. III, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared the governor's vetoes of subsections invalid, but the governor's vetoes of appropriations bill provisos were valid. Likewise, the trial court ruled that the governor's vetoes of appropriations reductions were valid and did not alter the provisos to such appropriations that remained. Both parties appealed. The court held that legislative drafting that altered the natural divisions of a bill to circumvent the governor's veto power should have been struck down. The court upheld the governor's veto of subsections because the subsections of a single section involved repeal of whole sections of the Revised Code of Washington and were de facto sections of legislation to which the veto applied. The court also held that any budget proviso with a fiscal purpose contained in an omnibus appropriations bill was an appropriations item under Wash. Const. art. III, section 12. Thus, if the legislature drafted budget bills as lump sum appropriations conditioned by provisos, the governor's veto power extended to each proviso. The court held that the governor could have vetoed a nondollar proviso in an appropriations bill without diminishing the overall agency appropriation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the governor's veto of the sections of bills that were improperly designated as subsections and affirmed the trial court's order that the governor's veto of dollar and nondollar appropriations bill provisos and reductions of expenditures in appropriations bills. The court modified the trial court's order as to provisos that conditioned agency expenditures on use of funds solely for purposes detailed in a proviso.</SPAN></P>

The newspaper claimed that the act violated its rights under both the U.S. Const. amend. I and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5.

However, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the act unconstitutionally infringed on the newspaper's right to freedom of the press. In so holding, the court concluded that: (1) the newspaper's no-conflict-of-interest policy was expressly designed to uphold its credibility and merited protection under the free press clauses of the state and federal constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city sought declaratory relief to determine the constitutionality of a housing inspection program, and also sought the issuance of warrants to inspect the premises of landlords and tenants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.160 allowed an appellate court to order convicted indigent defendants to pay appellate costs, including the fees for appointed counsel. The indigent petitioners maintained that the statute did not satisfy constitutional equal protection and right to effective assistance of counsel concerns. The court disagreed, finding that the statute contemplated the constitutionally required inquiry into ability to pay and the financial circumstances of the defendant as well as the burden payment would place on a defendant and his or her immediate family. The statute afforded the opportunity to object to the state's cost bill, and allowed for a remission petition at any time. Recoupment of appointed counsel's fees would necessarily be limited by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.88.330 to reasonable attorney fees.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.160 was a procedural statute that did not affect vested or substantive rights, and thus could be applied retroactively, although retroactive application was not at issue since the precipitating event for application of the statute concerning attorney fees and costs of litigation was termination of the case, which arose after the statute's enactment.</SPAN></P>

The parishioners appealed. The court affirmed and held that the ordinance's delay period was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court held that the ordinance had a coercive effect against the bishop in the practice of his religion because his plans were in furtherance of his fundamental right to the free exercise of religion. The court ruled that the parishioners had the burden of showing a compelling state interest in creating a delay, but failed to do so.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Washington), which affirmed his convictions for obstructing a public servant and resisting arrest. He contended that a uniformed off-duty police officer, who was working as a private security guard, could not be a public servant performing official duties for purposes of the obstructing statute and was not a peace officer for purposes of the resisting arrest statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two off-duty police officers were working as private security guards when they noticed defendant carrying a large sum of money and what appeared to be a baggie containing rock cocaine. The officers spoke to defendant and he ran from them. The officers caught him and he resisted arrest. Defendant was convicted of obstructing a public servant and resisting arrest. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that a uniformed off-duty police officer working as a private security guard could not be a public servant performing official duties for purposes of the obstructing statute and was not a peace officer for the resisting arrest statute. The court affirmed. It found that a police officer, whether on duty or off duty, was a public servant and a peace officer. It also found that the officers stepped out of their roles as private security guards and into their roles as police officers when they stopped defendant. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge were sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe the defendant possessed an illegal drug. As such, the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juveniles, one who was charged with murder and the other who was charged with kidnapping, sought review of a judgment of the trial court in their respective cases that held that petitioners were properly tried as adults for their serious violent offenses pursuant to the Basic Juvenile Court Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110, and were not entitled to a declination hearing in the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted direct review of petitioner juveniles' challenge to a judgment of their respective trial courts, where they were respectively charged with murder and kidnapping, that petitioners were to be tried as adults under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110, because the statute granted jurisdiction to the trial court over juveniles over the age of 16 who committed serious violent crimes rather than with the juvenile court. The court dismissed the petitions and found that the statute granted exclusive jurisdiction over petitioners to the trial court. There was no requirement that the trial court conduct a declination hearing in order to determine whether to remand petitioners to the juvenile court, because where the statute vested exclusive jurisdiction over petitioners with the trial court, there was no latitude to vest jurisdiction elsewhere. The court noted that once petitioners were within the trial court's jurisdiction, they were no longer considered juveniles over whom the juvenile court had jurisdiction. The court held that the statute's wide-ranging subjects did not offend the requirement under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 that there be rational unity between the sections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent dog owners were charged with violating Wash. Rev.

The court granted discretionary review, and reversed. With respect to the statute, the court noted that the Legislature was seeking to identify dogs likely to pose a significant danger to people and to require owners to take precautions reducing that danger. It was therefore reasonable to conclude that the Legislature did not intend to impose criminal liability if the owner was unaware of the dog's dangerous propensities. The court held that criminal liability arose under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 16.08.100(3) only if a dog that severely injured or killed a human being previously fell within the definition of either a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog. The State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of the crime, that the defendant either knew or should have known that his or her dog was a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog.</SPAN></P>

On further appeal the court held that 1) the hospital was required to advise the court of defendant's admissions under Wash. Rev.

The court held that the facts of the case established conduct that far exceeded that required for conviction of premeditated murder and felony murder because the evidence showed a prolonged, exceedingly violent assault on the victim.

Code &sect; 49.60.030. The court found that the broad recognition of rights contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.030(1) includes the right of an independent contractor to be free of discrimination based on sex, race, national origin, religion, or disability in the making or performing of a contract for personal services. The court also held that the golfer presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and held that (1) entrapment was an affirmative defense and the defendant was required to demonstrate that she was improperly induced to commit a criminal act which she otherwise would not have committed, (2) a review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the state lead to the conclusion that a rational trier of fact could have found that the defendant failed to prove entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence, (3) violation of due process rights could be raised for the first time on appeal, and (4) the state in soliciting the defendant from a meeting and in an emotional vulnerable state was outrageous conduct that violated the defendants right to due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that his mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole under Initiative 593 was unconstitutional and should be reversed because Initiative 593 constituted a bill of attainder and violated equal protection. The court found both claims without merit and affirmed the inmate's sentence. Only those persons who committed a third &quot;most serious offense&quot; after Initiative 593's effective enactment were subject to a life sentence. Therefore, those persons subject to Initiative 593 did not comprise a targeted, readily identifiable group being subjected to a legislative punishment and Initiative 593 was not a bill of attainder. Because the persons convicted of three &quot;most serious offenses&quot; under Initiative 593 did not constitute a suspect class or semisuspect class, the proper standard of review for equal protection purposes was rational basis review. Initiative 593's goal of improved safety was a legitimate state interest. Therefore, Initiative 593 passed rational basis scrutiny and did not violate federal or state equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that the victim owed him money for drugs. Defendant said that he took the bank bags when the victim's back was turned. The victim testified that there was a struggle and that he was threatened. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for second-degree robbery. The court held that permitting the State to use a prior assault conviction to impeach defendant's credibility was harmless error. Even if that evidence had not been before the jury, the outcome of the trial would, in all likelihood, have been the same. Defendant's admission that he took the bank bags contradicted his counsel's opening statements. Therefore, the State was properly permitted to cross-examine defendant on that issue. The admission of a photograph taken of defendant when he was arrested was proper because he raised the issue of identity, and the photo tended to show that the victim's description matched the man arrested. The admission of the photo was not prejudicial because the jury knew that defendant was arrested for the crime. Application of the Persistent Offender Accountability Act did not violate defendant's federal and state constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act did not violate Wash. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed the judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington) that reversed the two defendants' convictions under Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 12A.14.080 on the ground that the ordinance violated the right to bear arms guaranteed by Wash. Const. Art. I, &sect; 24. One defendant had been found carrying a concealed three inch blade and the other defendant carried a concealed six to nine inch blade.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to the weapons charges, one of the defendants was arrested for drug traffic loitering and the other for theft. Each was convicted of the weapons charge only. The handle of the knife carried by one defendant had duct tape for a handle. The concealed knife carried by the other defendant was a paring knife. The Washington Supreme Court ruled that the challenged ordinance, Seattle Municipal Code 12A.14.080, did not conflict with the right to bear arms guarantee of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 24. The court ruled that a legislative enactment is presumed constitutional and that a party challenging one must prove that it violates the constitution beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that defendants failed to prove that their knives were &quot;arms&quot; as contemplated by the constitutional provision. The court ruled that even if the knives were not &quot;arms&quot; the ordinance would still be valid only if it were a reasonable exercise of the police power. The court found that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the police power to promote safety, peace, and good order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was killed at a dam owned by defendant city. His employer had statutory immunity, so plaintiff estate filed suit against the city. The city claimed that the employer or employee was at fault, but under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.22.070(1), the jury could fault only the city and the employee. Therefore, the city asserted that &sect; 4.22.070(1) was unconstitutional. The Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington) agreed. The estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had held that &sect; 4.22.070(1) violated the city's right to a jury trial. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 4.22.070(1) did not remove any relevant factual issue from the jury and, therefore, did not violate the right to jury trial. The right to jury trial included the right to have the jury determine the allocation of fault. Evidence of an immune employer's negligence might be relevant to the jury's findings of which entities were at fault, however, the exact percentage of fault attributable to the immune employer had no legal effect on the liability of the city and the decedent. Consequently, the jury was not asked to make an irrelevant determination of the immune employer's fault. Section 4.22.070(1) did not set employer fault at zero percent. The statute created a liability allocation system that did not include immune employers. The statutory mechanism of setting total fault at 100 percent without regard for the potential contributory fault of an immune employer conveniently implemented the distribution of fault between those parties and other entities whose fault would actually affect the decedent's recovery and the city's liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the liability allocation system that did not include statutorily immune employers was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, who were ordered to pay restitution more than 60 days after sentencing, appealed their restitution orders as untimely. After defendants filed opening briefs, the state legislature amended the restitution statute to extend the time for determining restitution from 60 to 180 days. Defendants challenged the statute's retroactive application. On appeal, the court affirmed the restitution orders. The court held that, given the legislature's inadvertent omission of a reference to &sect; 9.94A.142 in the amendment that rendered it absurd and undermined its sole purpose, the court was permitted to supply the missing language to effectuate the legislature's intent that the amendment apply retroactively.

Even after petitioner provided a written demand for release respondent hospital continued to detain her without a hearing, in reliance on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.34.030. Although petitioner escaped from respondent hospital, the court held that the case was not moot because she faced the possibility of re-incarceration. The court noted that &sect; 71.34.030 was amended to permit a minor to be voluntarily admitted upon application of the parent, but the amendment did not change the requirement that a minor must be released within 24 hours of notice of intent to leave unless a petition was filed with the court to conduct a commitment hearing. The court held that under Wash. Rev.

The superior court determined that some charges were barred by res judicata due to an earlier recall petition and that others were factually and legally insufficient for submission to the voters under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.82.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a petition to recall the auditor, charging her with seven acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, and violation of her oath of office. The county prosecutor prepared a ballot synopsis and petitioned the superior court to determine the sufficiency of the charges and the adequacy of the synopsis. Affirming the trial court judgment, the court first rejected petitioner's argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.82 unlawfully restricted the right of recall established by Wash. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 33, 34, amend. 8, because the statute carried out the constitutional framers' intent to limit the scope of recall to recall for cause. The court also found Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.041(3), which gave local governmental entities the option to pay officers' expenses in defending recall charges, constitutional, and found that three of petitioner's charges were barred by res judicata. Finally, the court held that the remaining charges, including allegedly falsifying a document and destroying elections ballots, were insufficient because the petitioner did not have knowledge of facts indicating that the auditor intended to commit an unlawful act.</SPAN></P>

The United States Supreme Court had ruled that the tax exemption discriminated against interstate commerce pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court on remand of this earlier case held that it operated prospectively and no claims could have been made for taxes paid. The state legislature amended the law to cure the constitutional defect, which was to be applied retroactively. The court held that when the United States Supreme Court remanded a case, unless it explicitly reserves the issue of retroactive application of that case, the normal rule of retroactivity was assumed. The court overruled its decision in National Can Corporation vs. Department of Revenue, 109 Wash.2d. 818 (1988) to the extent that it held that Tyler Pipe Industries vs. Department of Revenue, 105 Wash.2d. 318 (1986) applied only on a prospective basis. The court found that the post deprivation remedy for unconstitutionally collected taxes provided meaningful backward looking relief that rectified the unconstitutional deprivation.

The court held that &sect; 9A.44.140(4) lowered the standard of proof for a waiver for juveniles younger than 15 years old, that the lower standard of proof was the quid pro quo for the two-year waiting period, that defendant did not have the option of undertaking the clear and convincing burden in order to apply for the waiver before two years, and that defendant was required to wait two years to seek a waiver of the sex offender registration requirement under &sect; 9A.44.140(4).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to the burglary charge.

The trial court granted the motion and increased defendant's sentence, finding that defendant had committed fraud upon the trial court by failing to disclose his full criminal history. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V barred the state from resentencing defendant. On appeal, the court held that the double jeopardy clause did not bar the state from increasing a defendant's sentence, even if the defendant had served the time, where the sentence was procured by fraud, provided that the state filed a motion to vacate the sentence, pursuant to Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former husband received disability retirement benefits. In a divorce decree, the trial court treated the former husband's disability retirement allowance as part community property and awarded the former wife 30 percent during his lifetime. The trial court held that she was not eligible for death benefits. On appeal, the former wife contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 41.26.030(6), 41.26.160, which provided for death benefits only for surviving spouses, violated due process. The wife argued that the death benefit was a form of deferred compensation that was earned during the marriage. The court held that every presumption favored the validity of an act of the legislature and that it could not be declared unconstitutional unless it clearly appeared to be so. The court held that no general community property interest under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.16.030 could surmount the plain language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.030(6), which clearly stated that a divorced spouse could not be a surviving spouse.

Rev. Code &sect; 29.79.040.On appeal, the court held that although the issue was moot because the filing date had expired, it would hear the case because the issue involved a substantial public interest that was likely to recur. The court held that the attorney general lacked discretion to refuse to prepare the ballot title on the ground that the initiative was beyond the scope of the state's legislative power. The attorney general's proper recourse was to prepare the ballot title, then seek an injunction to prevent the measure from being placed on the ballot. However, the initiative was invalid. It exceeded state legislative power because the scope of the initiative was federal and global in nature. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it was permitted to infer an intent to commit burglary based upon the evidence. The court determined that the instruction violated defendant's right to due process by creating a mandatory presumption that shifted the burden of persuasion on the intent element to defendant. However, the court held that the error was harmless because defendant's testimony was sufficient to establish all of the elements of first degree burglary.

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that since the state was not a party to the case, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order it to reimburse defendant. Although the court held that the statute authorized reimbursement in appropriate cases prosecuted under city ordinances, it found that courts were not granted authority to order cities to reimburse defendants who had been acquitted on assault charges based on self-defense. Since defendant was entitled to seek reimbursement of her costs from the legislature through a sundry claims process, under Wash. Rev.

The city contended the court erred in holding that the city could not enforce an ordinance that defined the offense of driving while intoxicated in a manner that was not in uniformity with the state statute defining the offense of driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented by this appeal was whether petitioner city could enforce an ordinance that defined the offense of driving while intoxicated in a manner that was not in uniformity with the state statute defining the offense of driving under the influence. The city ordinance, Seattle, Or., Municipal Code &sect; 11.56.020(A)(1), made it an offense to have a concentration of 0.08 grams of alcohol per a quantity of breath within two hours of driving a vehicle, whereas the statute made it unlawful to have a concentration of 0.10 grams of alcohol per the same quantity of breath within two hours of driving. The trial court dismissed a citation charging respondent with violating &sect; 11.56.020(A)(1), on the ground that the ordinance violated Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11, in that it conflicted with state law. On review, the city contended the trial court's dismissal was erroneous. The appeals court held that the uniformity requirement of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.08.020 and 46.08.030 precluded the city from enforcing &sect; 11.56.020(A)(1)(a). The court reasoned that a driver traveling only 20 miles east of the city could be confronted with different DUI standards in five different jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the dismissal of the citation against respondent because the city ordinance upon which the citation was based did not comply with the statutory uniformity requirement.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the civil forfeiture of &quot;proceeds&quot; as defined by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50 was not punishment and did not implicate double jeopardy. The court affirmed the conviction of one of the petitioners, holding that there was probable cause to issue a search warrant and that jeopardy did not attach in the civil forfeiture proceedings because the assets forfeited were the proceeds of illegal drug transactions. The court concluded that forfeiture of the proceeds of a crime was not punishment for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. V.

The residential property owners filed a class action seeking a declaratory judgment invalidating the utility charge. They challenged the constitutionality of the charges and sought a refund, an injunction against further collection, and attorney fees. The trial court certified the class. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The trial court upheld the charge, granted the city's motion, and dismissed the complaint. The property owners argued the charge was an unconstitutional property tax that violated Wash. Const. art. 7, &sect; 1. The city contended the charges were not taxes but utility charges or regulatory fees imposed pursuant to police powers. The appellate court held the charge failed to satisfy two of three requirements for a valid regulatory fee, failed to meet the special assessment definition, and could not be characterized as an excise tax.

The court held that county jails' policies were consistent with the grant of authority in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.150(1) requiring prisoners to be eligible for earned early release credit. Furthermore, employing an intermediate scrutiny analysis, the court determined that the state's substantial interest in maintaining prisoner discipline, particularly by preventing flight from prosecution and preserving local control over jails, justified disparate treatment to overcome defendants' equal protection challenge. Likewise, the court held that the disparate earned early release policies at issue did not result in multiple punishment to trigger double jeopardy protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon in violation of &sect; 9.41.250. The court of appeals reversed the conviction on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The issue was whether the statute was constitutional as applied to the facts and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her conviction under the statute. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and affirmed the conviction. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional and that the statute by its terms did not require a &quot;furtive overt movement&quot; element, as held by the court of appeals. Evidence of intent to conceal the dangerous weapon was all that was required. The evidence supported the finding that defendant furtively carried the knife she was convicted of possessing. Undisputed evidence showed that the knife was carried in an inner pocket, an unusual and suspicious place to carry a knife. The evidence also supported the finding that she carried the knife with the intent to conceal it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two people were murdered at a restaurant. Defendant had also recently been convicted of felony assault. At trial, defendant admitted the killings, but claimed diminished capacity based on his use of crystal methamphetamine. The jury convicted, and, finding aggravating factors, sentenced him to death. The court affirmed. The court held that there was no failure by the prosecutor to consider mitigating circumstances. It was not error to admit defendant's assault conviction for both motive and impeachment. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing in either &quot;in-life,&quot; crime scene, or autopsy photographs of the victims. The court's reasonable doubt, anti-sympathy, and mitigating factor instructions were not erroneous. It was not error to refuse to admit an essay written by one of the murder victims into evidence; it was not mitigating evidence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.060(3). The prosecutor did not misstate the law in construing how the jury could consider mitigating circumstances. Nor did the prosecutor's referral to the crime as &quot;heinous,&quot; &quot;brutal,&quot; and &quot;savage,&quot; or his appeal to sympathy for the victims' relatives, prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

When department of wildlife officers were made aware of defendant's possession of the wildlife, they attempted to retrieve the coyotes in a peaceful manner. Although defendant appeared to cooperate, he actually stifled the officers' attempts to retrieve the coyotes. When the officers became more aggressive, defendant became combative and assaulted the officers. Defendant was convicted of one count of unlawful possession of wildlife and two counts of third degree assault. Defendant appealed, most importantly presenting the issue of whether a person confronted with an allegedly unreasonable search or seizure may assault law enforcement officers and then rely on the exclusionary rule to foreclose admission of evidence pertaining to the assaultive behavior. In rejecting defendant's arguments, the court held that an assault against police officers following an illegal entry was outside the scope of the exclusionary rule because exclusion of such evidence would only license attacks upon law enforcement officers performing their duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' daughter, born in 1977, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy due to asphyxiation before or at birth. In 1979, the parents were advised by attorneys that they did not have a basis for a medical malpractice action. However, in 1991, they were advised that they did have a potential claim, and in 1992, the parents filed an action. The trial court dismissed the action, finding it barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court found that, after the 1986 amendment to &sect; 4.16.350, the statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims was no longer tolled during minority. The court reversed, holding that the 1986 amendment did not expressly repeal the tolling statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.190, when it imputed parental knowledge to minors. In construing the two statutes so that the integrity of both would be maintained, the court read &sect; 4.16.350 in such a way that a minor's rights were preserved until the age of majority, but when knowledge was imputed, for a three-year period of time only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee filed a motion to dismiss the charge of first-degree driving while having a revoked license upon the basis that the Department of Licensing (department) did not provide him with notice of revocation at his most recent address listed on papers in the department's possession. The court found that the appellate questions presented were: (1) whether Wash. Rev.

The court held that &sect; 46.20.205 was constitutional and did not deny the licensee due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It held the Act violated Wash. Const. art.

Code &sect; 84.52.065, school taxes must be levied on all real property every year. Under the Act, a portion of the property taxes collected from property owners in the redevelopment area was allocated to the regular tax authority administering the district, and a portion was allocated to the public improvement's sponsor. Under the formula in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.88.070, the portion to be allocated to the sponsor was equal to all property taxes generated by the difference between the assessed value of property in the year the redevelopment area was created and the assessed value of that property in the current year. In the absence of &sect; 39.88.070, this differential in assessed property value would be subject to school taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The witness refused to answer questions about a statement he made to police, claiming the privilege against self-incrimination. The trial court held him in contempt and imposed a 30 day jail sentence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.21. On appeal, the court upheld the contempt finding and the jail term. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the self-incrimination privilege did not authorize him to refuse to answer questions about his use of an alias.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.21.050 provided a proper basis for the contempt finding because his conduct conflicted with the maintenance of order in the court and the conduct of the defendant's trial, and it was manifestly offensive to the trial court's authority and dignity. The trial court followed proper procedure under &sect; 7.21.050 because the salient fact was set forth in the order and the imposition of the sentence one week after the case went to the jury was timely under the statute.

Defendant entered a not guilty plea, but attempted to plead guilty to felony murder when the prosecution merged the two counts. The trial court refused the guilty plea, and the prosecution sought the death penalty. The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree felony murder and aggravated first-degree murder with four aggravating factors of burglary, robbery, kidnapping, and concealment of identity. A death sentence was imposed and defendant sought review. The court found that there was no error by the trial court in any of its pretrial, trial, or post trial actions and that the death sentence was supported by sufficient evidence and was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an adult entertainment operator and two nude dancers, appealed from a judgment entered by the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which upheld Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code (SMC) 6.202.230, an administrative ordinance of defendant city governing license revocation and suspension related to adult entertainment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator and the dancers asserted that SMC 6.202.230 was facially unconstitutional because it failed to provide a stay of license revocation or suspension pending judicial review. They further argued that the ordinance violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5. The city argued that the statutory writ procedures under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.16 allowed for the cessation of penalties pending judicial review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment entered by the trial court, which upheld the ordinance, and struck the portion of SMC 6.202.230 that expressly precluded a mandatory stay. The court held that SMC 6.202.230 was unconstitutional because it lacked the minimum procedural safeguards under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5. Although nude dancing was removed from the core of protected expression, it had expressive value requiring constitutional protection. Moreover, the revocation and suspension of licenses constituted a prior restraint because future protected expression was suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association was involved in a labor dispute with its employees. Respondent union sought to represent the employees and impose collective bargaining. The court amended Wash. Gen. R. 12(b)(16) to provide that the association could, in its discretion, adopt collective bargaining for its employees. The association declined to do so, and the legislature amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56 (1994) to provide that the association was a public employer and to make collective bargaining mandatory. The association applied for a writ of prohibition on the ground that the statute violated the separation of powers provision of Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1. The association's application was granted. The court held that: (1) Wash. Gen. R. 12(b)(16), which made the association's collective bargaining discretionary, was in conflict with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56 (1994), which made it mandatory; (2) the constitution vested the judicial power of the state in a separate branch of government, the judiciary; (3) a basic function of the judicial branch of government was the regulation of the practice of law; and (4) the legislature lacked the power to supersede or detract from the power of the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of both first degree incest and second degree rape based on a single act of intercourse with his minor stepchild, was ordered to serve concurrent sentences. The court on review rejected defendant's double jeopardy argument, but not for the reasons proposed by the state. The court reversed the prior case law that held that imposition of concurrent sentences precluded attachment of double jeopardy, and held that with multiple convictions, the court had to determine whether the multiple charges arising from the single criminal act were in fact the same or separate and distinct offenses. The court held that under the &quot;same evidence&quot; rule, double jeopardy rights were violated if defendant was convicted of offenses that were identical both in fact and in law. But if each offense included elements not found in the others, the offenses were different and multiple convictions could stand. The court examined the language and legislative history of the respective statutes, and concluded that incest and rape were separate and distinct crimes due to distinct elements; the former required sex with a relative, the latter sex by the use of force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision that affirmed defendant's conviction for both first degree incest and second degree rape because double jeopardy was not violated. The court reversed prior case law that held that imposition of concurrent sentences precluded double jeopardy, but nevertheless found no constitutional violation because, under the same evidence rule, each charge was a distinct and separate offense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the department's motion to dismiss, which alleged that the hospital lacked standing to challenge its decision, but held that the issuance of the certificate of need was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The hospital had standing to challenge the department's decision because the legislature intended to protect the interests of competing health care providers when it enacted the certificate of need statute, Wash.

The court affirmed holding that specific intent either to create apprehension of bodily harm or to cause bodily harm was an essential element of assault in the second degree. The court found that the instruction did not set forth the intent requirement clearly because it was not enough to instruct the jury that the assault required an intentional unlawful act. The court held that even if the jury found that the act resulted in reasonable apprehension, it was not sufficient to convict because the act had to be accompanied by an actual intent to cause that apprehension and that it was reversible error not to tell the jury about that element.</SPAN></P>

The court found neither the state freedom of information act nor the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited the PUD employee from independently and voluntarily disclosing information. Further, the police officer's general request for help in fighting crime was not a request for information under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.314. Moreover, walking in an area near a residence which was impliedly open to the public and where marijuana could be smelled did not violate any constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that the court erred in dismissing the action on the ground that the state failed to give the landowners a hearing within 90 days of the mandate issued in a previous case. The mandate held that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505(e), a claimant was entitled to a full adversarial hearing within 90 days if the claimant contested the seizure. The court held that unlike the federal forfeiture statute, the Washington statute did not permit the state to take actual possession until after a full adversarial hearing. The court held that the state's contention that the court's language that &quot;claimants are entitled to a full adversarial hearing within 90 days if they contest the seizure,&quot; was dicta and should not have been relied upon by the trial judge, was plainly wrong. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the 90-day hearing limitation was applicable to the appeal, and the trial court properly dismissed the forfeiture action. The court held that the landowners were entitled to a full adversarial hearing within 90 days of the issuance of the mandate, and that the state ignored the unambiguous language and waited nearly 6 months before obtaining a trial date.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 7, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's judgment was proper. The taxpayer's property was assessed at rates significantly higher than those of intercounty utilities, including five other telecommunications companies operating in the county, and higher than other locally assessed personal property county taxpayers. The Department of Revenue directly assessed utilities which operated in multiple counties, but utilities which operated in a single county were assessed by the county assessor.

He fled the store and was chased by the security guard and the individuals. They caught the decedent and held him on the ground until police officers arrived. The police officers summoned a medic unit when decedent was unresponsive. An autopsy conducted by the medical examiner determined that he died from asphyxia due to compression of the neck and chest. The county executive requested that the district court convene an inquest, and the superior court enjoined the inquest. The superior court found that both Wash. Rev. Code Chapter 36.24 and the executive order that implemented that statute violated the constitutional separation of powers doctrine. The court reversed the superior court because the statute and executive order were constitutional under the separation of powers doctrine. The executive order did not exceed the executive's authority under the county charter. Although there were differences between the executive order and statute there were no conflicts of constitutional magnitude. Finally, inquest juries must have been chosen from county-wide source lists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that mandamus was an extraordinary writ that was not directed at a general course of conduct.

The court found that this did not apply because the law was inoperative at the time the action was commenced. The writ petition, in so far as it was based on still inoperative law, was premature. The citizens also sought declaratory relief, but the court found that it did not have original jurisdiction over that relief. For a declaratory judgment, a justiciable controversy had to exist that was an actual, present and existing dispute between parties having genuine opposing interests which were direct and substantial, for which a judicial determination would have been final and conclusive. The court found that the citizens had not met these elements and had requested an advisory opinion, which was not final and which the court would not grant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alien was charged and pled guilty to being a non-citizen in possession of a firearm in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.170. He was deported, re-entered the country, and was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, charged with being an alien in the United States after deportation. At the hearing on that charge, he attacked the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.170. The alien filed a motion in the district court to vacate judgment on his firearm conviction, which was denied. The superior court also denied his motion. On appeal, the court affirmed and held Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.170 was not pre-empted by the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1101 et seq., because it did not regulate immigration. The statute was not pre-empted by federal firearms laws under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 921- 930. States were permitted to co-regulate firearms, so long as the regulation was consistent with federal firearms laws. The court also held that the alien failed to make anything more than a facial equal protection challenge to the statute, which was not sufficient to prove its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords sought damages relating to four inspections of their apartment buildings. Three inspections were conducted with the tenants' consent. A fourth inspection was pursuant to a municipal court warrant issued after the exterior of the building revealed housing code violations. On appeal, the court held that the tenants had authority to consent to the searches of their apartments because the right of possession rather than the right of ownership determined who could consent and the tenants had the privacy interest in the leased premises. The tenants also had authority to consent to the common areas of the apartments in their own right and because landlords that operated residential apartment houses assumed the risk tenants would consent to inspections of common areas. The municipal court's warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment, but the municipal court lacked authority under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 to issue the warrant. The municipal court had no inherent authority to issue administrative search warrants and no statute or court rule authorized the issuance of such warrants that were supported by probable cause and based on a civil infraction rather than a crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A small number of legislators introduced legislation specifically designed to enable the second port to annex territory within the first port without the first port's approval. The underlying goal of the legislation was to increase the tax assessment of the second port at the expense of the first port. Ultimately, the legislature adopted &sect; 53.04.082. Under the authority of that statute, the second port adopted a resolution requesting that the county auditor put the question of annexation of the first port's territory lying within the expanded limits of second port on an election ballot. The first port brought suit to enjoin the second port from placing the annexation proposal on the ballot, arguing that &sect; 53.04.082 was unconstitutional because it impaired a contractual obligation and constituted special legislation. The trial court agreed on the first issue, but disagreed on the second issue. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute effected an unconstitutional impairment of the municipal bond contracts of the first port because it reduced the first port's tax base, upon which the bonds were premised.

Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court on the same grounds. The court further found that the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the project was inadequate as a matter of law because the EIS did not contain a detailed discussion of alternatives to the proposed action, as required by Wash.

The court also held that the proposed project was required to comply with the county's Solid Waste Management Plan (SWMP), pursuant to Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect;18.10.560, and thus the hearing examiner's conclusion that the SWMP was only a guideline was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

The developer filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, arguing that like a building permit, the MUP application vested on the date it was filed. The trial court quashed the writ of review because the developer did not first seek a reasonable use exception. The developer then sought and was denied the exception. The developer moved for summary judgment on the vested rights issue. The trial court denied the motion and the court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance.

The trial court found that the bifurcated nature of the statute's application violated due process. On appeal, the court held that the procedures under the statute were unconstitutional because they (1) were prior restraints upon protected speech as applied to adults; (2) were overbroad and reached constitutionally protected conduct; (3) violated due process by not providing sufficient time for defense preparation; (4) violated due process by subjecting all dealers to civil contempt proceedings even thought they might not have notice of what the court determined erotic; and (5) violated the right to a jury trial by allowing the decision of whether material was erotic to be made at the initial civil hearing.

The lower court had reversed the dismissal of the charges, holding that the state had presented sufficient evidence to prove illegal &quot;spotlighting&quot;. Defendants argued on appeal that it was impossible to hunt a decoy deer, and that the charges against them for &quot;spotlighting&quot; big game should be dismissed.

The court found defendants' argument had camouflaged an incorrect assumption, which was defendants had to actually encounter big game in order to hunt big game. When defendants had allegedly took aim at the decoy in their headlights, believing it to be a deer, they had hunted big game with artificial light, and had committed a violation of the &quot;spotlighting&quot; statute.

The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence, finding that defendant presented a substantial danger to the community due to his lack of amenability to treatment. On appeal, the case was remanded for resentencing. The trial court ordered an evaluation by a sexual deviancy program, which determined that defendant was not amenable for treatment. The trial court affirmed the exceptional sentence. Defendant appealed by writ of certiorari, claiming that the trial court's finding of non-amenability violated his constitutional rights because it was based upon his refusal to admit guilt and abandon his appeal. The court accepted certification from the appellate court. The court ruled that the trial court's imposition of the exceptional sentence was proper because it was supported by objective evidence that defendant was not amenable to treatment where there was a continuous pattern of sexually deviant offenses and previous failed attempts at treatment, which were followed by new and more predatory offenses. Thus, the constitutional issues were moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the statute on the ground that it violated the ex post facto clauses of the federal and state constitutions; one appellant also argued that the statute as applied to him violated the equal protection and due process clauses. The court held that the requirement to register as a sex offender did not constitute punishment and thus did not violate constitutional ex post facto prohibitions. It reasoned that the Legislature's purpose was regulatory, not punitive; registration did not affirmatively inhibit or restrain an offender's movement or activities; registration per se was not traditionally deemed punishment; and registration did not necessarily promote the deterrent function of punishment. It reasoned that any burdens upon registrants were an incident of the underlying conviction and were not punitive for ex post facto analysis. The court found no violation of one appellant's due process rights because registration was a collateral consequence of his underlying guilty plea. It held that the classifications established in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130(3)(A) for the purposes of establishing deadlines to register did not violate equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pedestrian tripped on a sidewalk and sustained injury. She brought suit against city and landowners for failure to maintain the sidewalk as required by Tacoma City Ord. 9.17.010, and city filed a cross-claim against landowners. Because the ordinance did not give a right of private action against a landowner, summary judgment was granted in landowners' favor on pedestrian's claim. Landowners moved for summary judgment on city's claim, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The superior court granted landowners' motion, and city appealed. In affirming, the reviewing court concluded that, while the ordinance at issue satisfied the first two prongs of the substantive due process test, it failed the third prong, which precluded an ordinance from being duly oppressive. The ordinance was unduly oppressive where it imposed an indemnification obligation upon a property owner without a finding of fault or without a judgment being entered against the city. The ordinance penalized landowners simply for failing to notify the city of sidewalk defects and required indemnification whenever injury occurred rather than when a judgment had been obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's grant of summary judgment in favor of landowners on city's cross-claim was affirmed, as the city ordinance was unduly oppressive and constituted an unreasonable exercise of the police power under a substantive due process analysis.</SPAN></P>

The provisions at issue concerned the valuation of land for the purpose of calculating the nursing homes' returns on investment allowances. The court found that the contracts between the nursing homes and DSHS were substantially impaired by the retroactive amendments and that the amendments were not reasonable and necessary to achieve a legitimate public purpose. Thus, the retroactive amendments to the reimbursement scheme were an unconstitutional impairment of contracts. Moreover, the retroactive amendments deprived the nursing homes of vested rights.

The court rejected defendant's claim that the state's use of peremptory challenges to remove jurors who did not favor the death penalty denied him his Sixth Amendment right to a jury representing a fair cross section of the community because the Sixth Amendment did not apply to groups defined solely in terms of shared attitudes such as opposition to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court held that where the city was unable to point to any statute or court rule that authorized a superior court to issue such search warrants, these warrants were void because they were issued by a judge who did not have the authority to issue such warrants. The court reasoned that Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 7, 32, commanded that no individual's private affairs could be disturbed without authority of law.

Defendant was given a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile offender was convicted of aggravated murder for committing a rape, robbery, and murder to an 85 year old woman. Defendant was two months' shy of his 18th birthday when the incident happened. The case was transferred from the juvenile court to the adult court where defendant was prosecuted as an adult, was found guilty of aggravated murder, and was given a death sentence. The court affirmed the conviction but vacated the imposition of the death sentence and remanded the case for imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The court held that the juvenile court did not err in declining jurisdiction, and the transfer of the case to adult court was proper under Wash. Rev. Code 13.40.110(2). The court held that defendant's issues raised about the conduct of the guilt portion of his trial, if not moot, did not present any basis for reversible error. The court vacated the death sentence and held that neither the juvenile court declination statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110, nor the death penalty statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95, authorized imposition of the death penalty to a juvenile offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant juvenile offender's conviction for aggravated first degree murder, but vacated the imposition of the death penalty and remanded the case for imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Neither the juvenile offender statute nor the death penalty statute could be construed as authorizing the imposition of the death penalty to a juvenile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved three separate defendants who were charged with malicious harassment under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.080 of the hate crime statute. The trial court dismissed the charges and the state appealed. The cases were joined to determine the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.080(2) was an unconstitutional content-based regulation of protected speech because it punished symbolic speech for its offensive message. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.080(1) was constitutional because it was a valid exercise of police power and neither overbroad nor vague, and did not violate equal protection because it regulated conduct and only incidentally affected speech. Section (1) enhanced the punishment of a crime that was directed towards victims because of their association with a protected class. The court affirmed the dismissal of charges against defendant whose conduct did not constitute criminal harassment, assault, or property damage. The court reversed and remanded the dismissal against the 2 defendants who actually damaged the victims' property, or because they placed the victims in reasonable fear for their persons.</SPAN></P>

The newspaper, the minor, and the mother argued that &sect;&sect; 13.31.110 and 13.50 did not apply to appellate proceedings and if they did, then &sect;&sect; 13.34.110 and 13.50 were unconstitutional. The court held that &sect;&sect; 13.31.110 and 13.50 applied only to superior court hearings and did not require appellate court proceedings to be closed to the press or public. Reading &sect;&sect; 13.31.110 and 13.50 in this way did not force every family to be faced with the prospect of having its story spread on the front page of a newspaper once an appeal was taken because Wash. Gen. R. 15 enabled families to seal records in the appellate courts. Both the mother and father had waived any confidentiality or privacy interest on their own behalf and the minor's guardian ad litem joined in the motion because he believed that opening the proceedings was in the minor's best interest. Thus, the department had failed to meet its procedural burden of persuading the court that access should have been restricted under Wash. Gen. R. 15.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Wash. Rev.

Defendant further asserted that &sect; 13.40.135 was vague because it did not require the finding of sexual motivation to be based on objective, criminal sexual conduct. The court determined that the term &quot;sexual motivation&quot; was sufficiently definite so that ordinary people could have properly understood what conduct was proscribed pursuant to &sect; 13.40.135. The court determined that under &sect; 13.40.135, &quot;sexual motivation&quot; meant that one of the purposes for which defendant committed the underlying offense was for the purpose of his or her sexual gratification. The court held that &sect; 13.40.135 properly required evidence of identifiable conduct by defendant while committing the offense which proved beyond a reasonable doubt the offense was committed for the purpose of sexual gratification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seven defendants entered guilty pleas to assault or sexual crimes.

Defendants appealed asserting that because they had pleaded guilty, there was no probable cause for blood extractions, they constituted illegal searches, and were only being used to accumulate evidence against future offenses. Defendants challenged their pleas as involuntary because they were not advised of the procedure prior to pleading guilty. The court held that the orders were proper, applying a &quot;rational relationship&quot; test due to the lack of a fundamental right not to have blood drawn. In that &sect; 43.43.754 applied only to persons who committed &quot;sex offenses&quot; or &quot;violent offenses,&quot; there was a rational relationship between the interest of the government in law enforcement and the application of the statute to this class of persons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state prisoners appealed a judgment dismissing their post-conviction petitions as untimely. The court affirmed. Each petition had filed for post-conviction relief over a year after their convictions had become final. Each then argued that any statute of limitations constituted an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and each also asserted that they had in any event not been properly informed of the enactment of the one-year statute of limitations. The court rejected these arguments. As to the suspension claim, the court held that the constitutional right to habeas corpus was more limited than the statutory post-conviction right, and consequently the limitations on state post-conviction relief did not violate the constitutional right to habeas. As to the notice claim, the court held that petitioners were not entitled to actual notice and, thus, the lack of actual notice was of no moment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment below was affirmed. Petitioner's post-conviction petitions were correctly dismissed, inasmuch as the one-year statute-of-limitations on post-conviction actions did not suspend the writ of habeas corpus and inasmuch as petitioners were not entitled to actual notice of the new one-year deadline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Washington), which dismissed his personal restraint petition alleging that his sentence to life imprisonment without parole, imposed under the 1977 aggravated murder/death penalty law, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.040-.047 (1977) and former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.94, was unconstitutional as imposing a harsher sentence for demanding a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate and a codefendant gunned down six people, killing five of them, including two young children. They were charged and tried together under Washington's 1977 murder/death penalty law, which was replaced in 1981. The State sought the death penalty, but the jury imposed life without the possibility of parole after convicting the inmate of five counts of murder in the first degree. The inmate's petition asserted that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights by penalizing him for demanding a trial by jury because a defendant who entered a guilty plea was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. The court held that the petition was procedurally barred because the inmate failed to meet his threshold burden of demonstrating an actual and substantial prejudice. Granting parole was solely within the discretion of the parole board. The fact that a defendant was given the possibility of parole did not guarantee parole. Therefore, the sentences were substantially similar, and there was no prejudice shown. Also, because of the substantial similarity in the sentences, the inmate's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was not chilled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance that ordered improvements to a street and created the LID.

Rev. Code &sect; 35.44.047, read: &quot;more fairly reflected the special benefits.&quot; Following the confirmation of the final assessment roll, the owners unsuccessfully challenged the roll in the superior court; the lower appellate court certified the case to the court, which reversed the judgment. The court held that the city founded the LID assessments on a fundamentally wrong basis, which was ground for judicial denial of confirmation of the assessment roll pursuant to &sect; 35.44.250. There was no evidence presented that showed that the trips generation method that the city used &quot;more fairly reflected the special benefits.&quot; The expert testimony at the trial found no relationship between trips generation and special benefits. Two-thirds of the assessments were based upon a speculative future highest and best use that was totally without evidentiary support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent press organizations challenged the constitutionality of 1993 Wash. Laws 188, &sect; 9, which required courts to ensure that information identifying child victims of sexual assault was not disclosed to the public or press during the course of judicial proceedings or in any court records. The trial court found the section unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the state and county from enforcing it. The court affirmed, finding it violative of the right of open access to judicial proceedings, as guaranteed under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. The court stated that art. 1, &sect; 10 allowed for the separate, clear, and specific provision entitling the public, including the press, to openly administered justice. This right of access was not absolute, and may be outweighed by some competing interest. The court found in the present case that the competing interests were also compelling: protecting children from further trauma. However, the disputed law did not permit trial courts to conform to constitutional guidelines and make a balance of the competing interests. Thus, the law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the partial summary judgment in defendant's favor in that the leave cash payouts under the PERS I employee's pension plan applied only to the extent that the leave accrued during plaintiffs' two year average final compensation.

The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.24.340(1)(a), which mandated HIV testing of convicted sexual offenders, applied to juveniles. The juvenile sexual offenders' purported semantic differentiation that juveniles were not &quot;convicted&quot; but &quot;adjudicated&quot; was without merit because other criminal laws applied &quot;conviction&quot; in reference to juvenile dispositions. Public policy favored the application of &sect; 90.24.340(1)(a) to juveniles. The state's testing of the juvenile sexual offenders' blood for HIV constituted a special need for which a warrant or an individual suspicion of the presence of HIV was not required under the Fourth Amendment. The state's compelling interest in detecting and preventing the spread of HIV outweighed any expectations of privacy. Their privacy interest in the confidentiality of their test results was protected by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.24.015, and access to test results was allowed only to persons with a genuine interest.

The court held that the search warrant was overbroad and invalid because it did not state with sufficient particularity the crimes under investigation and permitted the seizure of broad categories of material without reference to any specific criminal activity. The court affirmed those convictions based upon appellant's confession because, the confession, taken together with independent corroborating evidence, was sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions.

He was convicted of two counts of communication with a minor for immoral purposes in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090 and one count of indecent exposure. The appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court also affirmed. The trial court had not erred by instructing the jury that the term &quot;immoral purposes&quot; in &sect; 9.68A.090 could be defined as &quot;immoral purposes of a sexual nature.&quot; Section 9.68A.090 was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute did not require defendant to have actually communicated a contractual offer to the girls. It was sufficient that he had invited or induced them to engage in behavior constituting indecent liberties, even without consideration. The state adequately proved the constitutional validity of defendant's previous conviction for indecent liberties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the of the Court of Appeals, Division One (Washington), that affirmed his trial court conviction for a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act (Act), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040, based on his prior predicate conviction for manslaughter in the first degree. Additionally, he applied for a petition of personal restraint that was consolidated with his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a violation of the Act on the basis of his earlier predicate conviction for manslaughter in the first degree. The court of appeals affirmed his trial court conviction, and he appealed. He also applied for a personal restraint petition that was consolidated with his appeal of the judgment of the court of appeals. On appeal, he contended that the earlier conviction was constitutionally invalid because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the state had the burden of proof upon a claim of self-defense; and that as a consequence of that failure, one element of the Act was constitutionally invalid under the court's precedent. The court held that: defendant could challenge the validity of the manslaughter conviction on the basis of the defective instruction because that conviction was not final at the time an appellate decision reallocated the burden of proof on self-defense; the reallocated burden of self-defense applied in the underlying manslaughter trial; and, the instructions given in that trial were therefore constitutionally defective as they misrepresented the burden of proof. Thus, the court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed. Defendant's conviction under the Act therefore was vacated, and his personal restraint petition was granted.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.030(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury on two counts of aggravated first-degree murder. During the sentencing phase, the jury determined there were not sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant leniency, and he was sentenced to death pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.030(2). On appeal, he challenged both his conviction and his sentence on constitutional and procedural errors. He claimed the state failed to produce material information to the defense in response to a general request under Brady. The court affirmed. It noted that the jury returned a verdict of guilty, finding that defendant had committed first-degree murder accompanied by an aggravating circumstance: multiple victims killed as part of a common scheme or plan. The state's nondisclosure of the information did not warrant reversal. The information was not both favorable to the accused and material to determining guilt or punishment. The death penalty statutory procedures followed were valid, the death sentence was comparatively proportionate to sentences imposed in similar cases, and the death sentence was not arbitrarily, wantonly, or freakishly imposed and was not the result of passion or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.225(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A widow's late husband, a disabled worker receiving temporary total disability and Social Security retirement, was notified by the Department of Labor and Industries (Department), that his workers' compensation was to be reduced as of August 1986, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.225(1), as a setoff to Social Security. The statute had an exception for workers receiving permanent total disability prior to July 1, 1986. The worker never applied for permanent total disability, although his physician stated his condition was permanent. The worker appealed, but the Department's ruling was affirmed. He then filed suit, and the superior court granted summary judgment for the Department. He died pending appeal, and his wife was substituted as appellant. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.225 was not ambiguous, and the worker did not fall within the exception for those &quot;receiving&quot; permanent total disability before July 1; 2) the statute did not violate the vested rights clause of the Washington Constitution; 3) the statute did not violate equal protection under the state and federal constitutions; and 4) federal law did not preempt the offset.</SPAN></P>
