</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners challenged the judgment of the Nebraska Department of Water Resources authorizing defendant metropolitan utilities district (MUD) to supplement its water supply in the maximum amount of 60,000,000 gallons of ground water per day from a well field, which the landowners claimed would affect their water table.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners claimed that the grant of the permit violated Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 14, and art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 16, and 21. The MUD claimed that the landowners failed to show a sufficient interest to raise the question of constitutionality. The landowners argued that the withdrawal of 60,000,000 gallons of water from the ground at the site of the MUD well field would reduce the water table under their lands to their damage. The experts stated that there would be no lowering of the water table beyond the perimeter of the cone of influence. Both experts testified that the cone of influence would not extend more than 5,000 feet to the north and not more than 2,000 feet to a half-mile to the east. The land interests of the landowners were to the east or downstream from the well field and far beyond the cone of influence, relatively speaking. The court also found that based upon the evidence the lowering of the river level would have only a negligible effect upon the landowners' underground water, which they asserted was controlled by the rise and fall of the Platte River.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The objectors contested the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-638 (1963), which authorized the Department of Water Resources to approve the extraction of ground water and the department's decision to grant such a permit to the water utility. The court affirmed the department's decision. The court noted that the objectors could raise constitutional issues for the first time on judicial review because the administrative agency was not empowered to decide constitutional issues. Based on evidence concerning water levels and flows, the court found that the objectors did not have sufficient interest to raise a constitutional issue. The court declined to declare the applicable statute unconstitutional as an overbroad delegation of power because the invalidation of the statute would not benefit the objectors. Because the water utility's proposed pumping was a reasonable use for the public benefit, the court concluded that the permit granted by the department did not infringe the riparian rights of the objectors.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the city raised the issues of whether the Board had jurisdiction and whether or not the Board had the authority to disregard a tripartite agreement in reaching its decision. The court held that the Board had subject matter jurisdiction and that the evidence before the Board was sufficient to sustain its findings that the grant of power district's application would better serve the public convenience and necessity and most economically and feasibly supply electric service to the other town without duplication of facilities or operations. The court held that the provisions of the tripartite agreement were subject to Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When it became apparent that the second city could no longer provide adequate electrical energy to its college, it contracted with the first city to construct a transmission line and furnish electrical energy to the college. The first city filed its application with the board to construct the transmission line. The power district objected and filed its own application, asserting that it already had power lines running into the second city's rural areas, and requested that it be granted the authority to provide the second city's power. The court held that the board had jurisdiction over the matter because Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 70-1012 (Supp. 1963) placed the authority to decide factual issues involving the construction of large power lines to the board. The court could only intervene if the board's decision was arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by evidence. The evidence supported the board's finding that allowing the first city to construct a power line would have resulted in an unwarranted duplication of service and that the contract was subject to the board's authority under &sect; 70-1012. The court refused to disturb the board's order.</SPAN></P>

The application was denied by the building inspector, by the board of zoning appeals, and by appellee City of Lincoln, Nebraska. The District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) affirmed. The fraternity appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fraternity purchased and used the property for a period of time. The fraternity desired to build a new building to house more students. Because the proposed building would house 12 more students than a building that fit within the zoning requirements, the fraternity sought a variance. The fraternity argued that because it was not economically desirable to construct the smaller building and because of the university's housing code requirements for the fraternity, it was entitled to a variance based upon practical difficulties. On appeal, the court reviewed the board of zoning appeals' decision for abuse of discretion and whether the decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or illegal. The court found that the board of zoning appeals' decision was not an abuse of discretion and was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or illegal. The court concluded that the fraternity could have built a building that met the zoning requirements without practical difficulty and that the zoning requirements permitted the fraternity a reasonable use of its land. The court refused to address the fraternity's arguments that the City's zoning code was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant corporation appealed from a judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska). On remand, the trial court declared an installment contract between the parties void, and ordered the corporation to return two downpayments that plaintiffs had made to it on the contract with interest from the respective dates of payment. The trial court then overruled the corporation's motion to vacate the judgment and for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior appeal, the court reversed and remanded a decision of the trial court, which held that the contract was valid. On rehearing from the previous appeal, the court directed the trial court to determine both the amount of the downpayments that plaintiffs had made as well as whether they were entitled to a return of those payments. On the second appeal, the corporation claimed that the trial court erred in finding the installment sales contract void and uncollectible and that the trial court erred in requiring a return of plaintiffs' downpayments on the contract. The court held that the trial court had no alternative under the mandate but to enter a judgment holding the contract void and uncollectible. The trial court did not err in following the court's mandate. However, the trial court erred in requiring the corporation to return the two disputed downpayments to plaintiffs because the statute involved at the time of the contract, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-138, did not require the return of the downpayments, but only provided that the type of contract entered into by the parties was void, and that the corporation would have no right to collect any principal, interest, or charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's judgment declaring the installment contract void, but reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment requiring the corporation to return the two downpayments with interest to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

The meaning of the act was sufficiently clear and certain to avoid a charge of such indefiniteness as to violate constitutional requirements. The court found that Neb. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state legislature enacted a comprehensive registration act governing the practice of engineering and architecture. The architect contended that the act was unconstitutional and, if constitutional, he had grandfather rights to practice professional architecture under the provisions of the act. The court affirmed. The court found that the fact that the requirements for registration were the same for the two related professions did not amount to an improper classification or discrimination. The court determined that the proof of attempted compliance by the architect was unsatisfactory because he had one year to enforce his right to a grandfather certificate and did not do so, thus failing to pursue his legal remedy. The court concluded that, having failed to secure a certificate of registration within the time provided for exercising his grandfather right, or in any other manner provided by the act, the architect stood in violation of the act and was properly enjoined from continuing such violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State commenced an action against the property owner to take 17.8 acres of land from her so that it could control the outside advertising on the land. The land was located adjacent to an interstate highway. A board of appraisers found that the easement on the land was valued at $ 100. Believing that the taking was valued at $ 5,000, the owner appealed that determination to the trial court, which returned a verdict for the State. The property owner alleged that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the proper compensation for the taking. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the measure of damages for which the owner was entitled to was only the difference between the reasonable market value before and after the taking. The court found that the property owner did provide independent proof of the actual value of the land before the condemnation and that such evidence showed a sum certain for monies lost by the owner for advertising for at least a five-year period. The court held that the loss of advertising income should have been a compensated loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporations appealed from a decision of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which determined that an ordinance enacted by defendant city was constitutional, save for one portion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance that sought to regulate employment practices in private business within the city. The ordinance would add a new chapter to the municipal code entitled Fair Employment Practices, and would make it unlawful for an employer of three or more persons to discriminate on the basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, or ancestry. The ordinance would apply to the corporations. The corporations contended the city was without power to implement such an ordinance. The court reversed and remanded. The corporations' contention that the city charter was a limitation of power was without merit. However, there was no grant of power given to the city in its charter to pass an ordinance pertaining to fair employment practices or civil rights. The matters of fair employment practices and civil rights are matters of statewide and not of local concern. Therefore, the city exceeded its powers in enacting the ordinance. The state had passed several statutes governing those topics, making it clear that the state Department of Labor was vested with the power and responsibility of enforcing employment regulations within the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the district court's decision to uphold the majority of an ordinance enacted by the city.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the ordinance was a proper exercise of municipal authority, and was not arbitrary or discriminatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, county attorney and county sheriff, challenged a judgment of the District Court for Scotts Bluff County (Nebraska), which declared &quot;A Sunday Closing Law,&quot; 1963 Neb. Laws ch. 392, &sect;&sect; 69-901 - 69-909, to be void and unconstitutional and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing its provisions against plaintiff retailer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question the court had to determine was whether the classifications embraced within the Sunday Closing law had some reasonable relation to the promotion of health, peace, and the good order of society, and were based upon reasonable distinctions affecting all persons similarly situated or engaged in the same type of business without discrimination. The court noted that the classifications had to rest on real differences among members of the class, and the classification had to bear reasonable relationship to the purposes of the legislation. Affirming, the court noted that it was illegal to sell orange juice or a can of coffee on Sunday, but permissible to sell a can of beer. Further, it was illegal to sell a pound of hamburger or a dozen wieners, yet permissible to sell the buns or bread with which they would be used. The court found that reason could not explain how the promotion of the declared purpose of the statute was justified by the discrimination inherent in the approach taken. The court held that the commodity classifications were arbitrary and discriminatory. The statute was also arbitrary in that it exempted establishments having two or less employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that the Sunday Closing Law was discriminatory, arbitrary, and unreasonable, and denied the retailer the equal protection of the law and deprived the retailer of its property without due process of law, all in violation of the retailer's rights under the Constitution of the State of Nebraska and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also sustained the assignee's motion to strike certain allegations of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchasers entered into a contract of conditional sale for the purchase of a truck from the seller, who later assigned the contract to the assignee. The purchasers subsequently filed suit to declare the contract void, alleging that it was in fact a loan made in violation of the Nebraska Installment Loan Act (Act) and thus, was void and unenforceable. On appeal from the trial court's dismissal of the purchasers' action, the court held that the purchasers' contract was valid and enforceable because L. B. 17, 74th Leg., Spec. Sess., 1963 Neb. Laws ch. 9, which provided that loans made in violation of the Act were no longer void on that account, was a valid and constitutional act of the legislature and was applicable to the purchasers' action. The court found that L. B. 17, which was given retroactive effect to all transactions made prior to the effective date of the legislation, including the purchasers', was constitutional because the purchasers did not have a vested right in the penalty provisions of the Act as they existed at the time the contract was entered into, nor did the repeal of such provisions impair the obligation of the purchasers' contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the purchasers' action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City passed an ordinance mandating Sunday closing for businesses. The department store filed an action seeking an order temporarily and permanently restraining the City from enforcing the provisions of the ordinance and seeking to have the ordinance nullified as unconstitutional. The department store and the City entered into a stipulation to have the hearing for the temporary and permanent injunction heard by the trial court simultaneously. The trial court then consolidated the department store's action with three other pending actions involving the same ordinance. At trial, the department store argued that the City failed to comply with the notice requirements of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-405 (Reissue 1943), and that the ordinance was unconstitutional by unreasonably classifying businesses and granting special privileges to some classes and not others. The trial court entered judgments in all four cases in favor of the City and upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance. The department store sought review. The court found that the ordinance's unequal and unfair treatment of some businesses was discriminatory, and violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1959, the taxpayers filed their business inventory with the county assessor. Later that year, the taxpayers filed additional motor vehicle inventory lists. The county assessor, pursuant to Neb. Rev.

The court agreed with the taxpayers' contention that no timely compliance could be made because at no time during the year did the statute fix a day for the filing of the return that could be complied with within the prescribed period. The court also agreed that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1735 (Reissue 1943) as amended in 1955 provided one method or procedure for the recovery of taxes or any part thereof that for any reason was invalid, including the recovery of penalties as well as taxes. The court rejected the assertion that &sect; 77-1736.05 (Supp. 1961) applied as the taxpayers' sole remedy, stating that it was remedial in nature and extended the time for serving notice and demand for a refund to those who had lost their rights to do so under various amendments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City contended that, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-603 (Reissue 1943), it had the right to proceed to trial after the business owners voluntarily dismissed their petitions. The court disagreed and ordered dismissal of the entire action. The district court properly dismissed the petitions pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-601 (Reissue 1943). However, it was improper to retain the case for trial because the City's answer did not state a cause of action against the business owners. It was defensive only and did not plead any facts that entitled the City to any affirmative relief against the business owners. Thus, it was not a counterclaim and Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-603 (Reissue 1943) did not apply. Accordingly, the business owners' dismissal of their petitions effectively withdrew the entire case from the district court's consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being denied a city permit to place a trailer house on his property, the property owner put a trailer house there nonetheless. The city filed suit to enjoin the property owner from maintaining the house trailer on his property under Ordinance 297. The trial court denied the city injunctive relief. Upon review the court affirmed, holding that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain a finding that the maintenance of the trailer where located was a nuisance. The court held that Ordinance 297 did not apply to the property owner because his request for a city permit was made prior to the effective date of Ordinance 297 and at a time when the city's municipal code provided for such permits. The court held that the trial court's judgment essentially determined that the denial of the property owner's permit application was an abuse of discretion or an arbitrary action on the part of the city council, and such determination was proper. The court held that Ordinance 297 could not be construed to operate retroactively to divest the property owner of his interests.</SPAN></P>

The wording of the information was such that defendant could only be charged with obtaining money on representations he knew to be false with the intent to defraud and cheat the victim. Defendant was fully and sufficiently informed by the information of the charge against him. The court found that the record established that there was probable cause for defendant's arrest, and his arrest was legal. There is no evidence in the record that defendant's car was searched incident to an arrest other than the implication to be drawn from defendant's testimony.

The trial court had allowed a peremptory writ of mandamus and had overruled the Assessor's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City passed an ordinance that purported to annex certain real property and requested that the Assessor place the property on the tax assessment records of the City, which he refused to do. The City filed a mandamus action, and the trial court, after a bench trial, issued a peremptory writ of mandamus. The owners filed a motion to intervene and the trial court denied that motion and motions for a new trial. On appeal the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The trial court should have allowed the owners to intervene because they had a direct and immediate interest that they would lose by the direct operation and legal effect of the mandamus judgment. The ordinance involved did not comply with the provisions of the City's home rule charter because the land contained tracts in excess of five acres. The tracts were also larger than that allowed by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-112 (Reissue 1943). A city derived its power to annex property from the legislative enactment, and it was strictly construed. The City did not have the authority to extend its boundaries over the real estate, and the entire ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant national airline challenged parts of five orders of appellee, the Nebraska State Railway Commission, which required the airline to apply for permission and pay a fee to the Commission in order to obtain authorization for issuance of shares of common stock, for issuance of a stock dividend, for issuance of stock for a consolidation with another airline, for issuance of debentures, and for approval of a credit agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In each of the five cases the airline asked for an order that disclaimed jurisdiction, made an alternate request for authorization of the issuance of stock or financial transactions, and paid the statutory fee required for issuance of the authorization without waiver of its right to contest the jurisdiction and fees when the Commission refused to disclaim. On appeal, the Commission disclaimed jurisdiction in three of the cases. The court determined that the Commission did not have jurisdiction in the remaining claims. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 75-704 (1943) was not properly applied to the airline, which had very little connection with Nebraska. The stock issues and financing were general airline business and not local in nature. The regulation placed a direct burden on interstate commerce, and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution prevented the Commission from requiring a certain system of accounts because then every other state could require its separate system. The court had no authority to order return of the fees in the appellate action.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-901 (Supp. 1959), which permitted the extension of existing zoning ordinances to additional residents, was invalid. He argued that reliance on the statute to adopt the Ordinance, which extended existing zoning regulations to residents within one mile of the corporate city limits, denied equal protection and due process of law in violation of U.S Const. amend. XIV and Neb. Const. art. 1. The resident contended that the passage of the ordinance caused &quot;unpredictable damage&quot; to his property. On review, the court found that there was no misjoinder but that the injunction was in error. The court held that the state statute was valid, that city officials complied with the statute, and that the disputed ordinance was not a new zoning ordinance. The court also took into account a provision in the state statute providing that the extension of existing zoning ordinances would not interference with those using their properties for livestock.

The court held that the city council was the proper party to determine whether the petition was signed by the required number of property owners and that its finding was conclusive. Although Neb.

The court rejected as without merit the landowners' contention that &sect; 17-510 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Neb. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) which, in the declaratory judgment action filed by appellee utilities district, held that L.B. 295 (1959), under and pursuant to which the parties had entered into a contract regarding the collection and remittance of sewer service charges, was unconstitutional in certain respects. The city's motion for a new trial was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of the validity of a contract it had entered with the city. Pursuant to the contract the district agreed to collect for and remit to the city the sewer service charges that the city had imposed by Omaha, Neb., Ordinance No. 21141. On appeal, the court held that L.B. 295 (1959) was constitutional, that Omaha, Neb., Ordinance No. 21141, passed by the city under and pursuant thereto, was valid, and that the district and city could have lawfully entered into a contract whereby the district agreed to use the facilities and services of its water department to collect and remit the sewer service fee or rental use lawfully imposed by the city. However, the court determined that the trial court correctly held that the contract between the district and the city was not made in conformity with the applicable provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-1041 (Reissue 1943), which required allocation of the cost of such operation by the district's board of directors upon some reasonable basis. Therefore, the contract was inoperative and without force and effect for it was not made within the scope of the district's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified and as modified affirmed the trial court's judgment, which held that the contract between the district and the city was inoperative and of no effect. The modification consisted of the court's holding that the legislative act, pursuant to which the parties had entered the contract, was constitutional. The court remanded the case for entry of a judgment in accordance with its holding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Husband's wife hired the attorney to represent her in a divorce proceeding between the husband and the wife. Without being charged with any criminal offense, the husband was incarcerated in the city jail for five days and the county jail for two days. The husband, believing that the attorney was working in his official capacity as the city and county attorney, gave a deed and a bill of sale to the attorney, not knowing that the attorney was about to file a suit for divorce on the wife's behalf. The husband also alleged that the attorney induced him to sign voluntary commitment papers to the state hospital. The husband filed an action against the attorney and sought to recover treble damages provided by &sect; 7-106 R.R.S. 1943. The trial court held that &sect; 7-106 was violative of Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5. The court affirmed and stated that penalties in favor of private persons were violative of Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5 and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Subsequently, the court held that &sect; 7-106, insofar as it provided for treble damages, was violative of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholder contended that the corporation and directors issued stocks and securities to him in Nebraska without a license or permit from the state banking department to authorize them to do business as brokers or salesmen. The stockholder filed an action to recover for five allegedly illegal transactions. The district court found against the stockholder on all except one transaction evidenced by a promissory note executed by the corporation. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment as to the promissory note. The court also affirmed judgment against the stockholder as to one transaction that was made and completed prior to the date that the Blue-Sky Law provisions became effective. The court otherwise reversed the judgment as to the second, third, and fourth transactions. The court held that, during the times that the directors were officers of the corporation, they held a fiduciary duty to the stockholder to be responsible for the transactions; the directors should have known that the corporation did not have the proper licensing or authority to sell the securities, and could have been held personally liable for the fraudulent activity.</SPAN></P>

The Act also declared that any violation of the Act or of the director's regulations was a misdemeanor. HEW's recommendations were a suggested model only, and had not been enacted as law. The dairy did not comply with the regulations. The court held that the Act unconstitutionally delegated to the director the power to define crimes. The director's regulations might be changed from time to time and their validity could not be ascertained from the authorizing statute. Defendants' demurrer admitted the dairy's allegation that its milk was wholesome and nutritious without compliance with the Grade A Milk regulations. The due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions guaranteed to the dairy the right to engage in any lawful business and the state could not prohibit the sale of a wholesome, nutritious food product.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed an information against defendant, which alleged that defendant willfully and unlawfully disturbed the peace in violation of Neb.

The court affirmed, holding that the information failed to specify the acts that constituted the offense charged. The court noted that Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 gave defendant the right to demand the nature and cause of accusation. Due process, the court added, required that defendant be given sufficient notice of the nature of the charge in order to allow him to prepare a defense. The court said that to meet these requirements, the information was required to state each fact that was an essential element of the crime charged so that defendant was not required to go beyond the information to learn the nature of the charge against him. Here, the court said, the absence of allegations in the information as to what defendant did to disturb the peace, where the act took place, and what person was disturbed made it impossible for defendant to have prepared his defense.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect;&sect; 3 and 21 because where a legislative act permitted the organization of a district, for the construction of a public improvement, by private individuals, to be paid for by a tax on all the property in the district, and no provision was made for a hearing by any tribunals as to the right of property owners who might be injured, it resulted in the taking of private property for a public purpose without just compensation and without due process of law. Finally, even if 1959 Neb. Laws 9, p.107 cured the Act's defects, jurisdiction of the case was lodged in the court prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the company never informed the decedent that finance charges would be added if the decedent wanted to finance the balance of the cash price over time. The civil penalties contained in the Installment Loan Act, Neb. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-1587 to -15,104 (1943).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties were divorced out-of-state, and the ex-wife sought to register the divorce decree under the Act and to collect spousal and child support arrearages. The ex-wife caused a summons to be issued, filed an affidavit for garnishment, and took other like action. The ex-husband filed a motion to quash the garnishment; the case went before the district court, which quashed the ex-wife's motion on ground that the Act was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the district court erred in quashing the garnishment. The ex-husband's attack was not based on the contents of the Act but on what the Act failed to contain; the ex-husband's contention that the Act permitted garnishment before judgment, on affidavit alone, was groundless. The divorce decree was a judgment, and the district court was obliged to recognize it as such on and after registration. The ex-wife, as judgment creditor, had the right of levy and the establishment of a lien on the property of the ex-husband, who was a judgment debtor. The ex-wife followed the correct procedure and was entitled to judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The riparian owner constructed dikes and levees on his lands whereby he obstructed the flow on his lands of floodwaters. By so doing, the riparian owner caused the waters to flow over and across the landowners' property where it had not been wont to flow prior to such channels being dug and dikes and levees being constructed. The landowners were involved in litigation with other parties against the riparian owner seeking an injunction preventing him from continuing to cause the waters to flow over their lands. Following the disposition of that litigation, the landowners brought this action to recover monetary losses caused by the actions of the riparian owner. The trial court held in favor of the landowners, and the riparian owner appealed. The court ruled that to permit the landowners to maintain a separate suit for monetary damages was to permit the splitting up of a cause of action. The court reversed the judgment in favor of the landowners, concluding that the landowners precluded themselves from claiming any monetary loss for damages they suffered by failing to ask for such in their original action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision, holding that the taxpayer could maintain the action even though precedent demand was not made upon the city attorney to do so. The city refused to bring an action and to require demand of the city attorney would have been a useless procedure. The court held that the four-year statute of limitations, Neb. Rev.

The trial court found that no lien existed because the lien was not timely filed, but it entered a personal judgment against the homeowners. One homeowner appealed, contending that the trial court, after holding that the plumber had no enforceable lien, was without authority to enter a personal judgment. The court affirmed the finding that there was no mechanic's lien. However, the court held that the trial court, having found that the plumber was not entitled to any equitable relief, was not authorized to enter a personal judgment against the homeowners as a right incidental to the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction. The court found that there was no opportunity afforded the homeowners, after equitable relief was denied, to demand a jury trial except in a motion for a new trial, which was filed. The court concluded that the record was insufficient to sustain a holding that the homeowners waived their right to a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant irrigation district filed an action seeking an order confirming and approving its organization and the validity of a contract it had entered into with the United States. Appellee landowners challenged, seeking to avoid the contract. The District Court for Hitchcock County (Nebraska) held that most but not all of the contract regarding an irrigation project was valid. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Irrigation district sought judicial approval of a proposed contract between it and the federal government. Under that contract, the irrigation district would sell its irrigation system to the federal government and would in turn buy water from it. Landowners in the district objected. The judge assigned to the case approved most of the contract, although it rejected a few of its provisions (the so-called &quot;excess-acres provisions&quot;) on the grounds that the landowners in the district had a vested right in the water appropriated by the government. Such provisions constituted a taking of property without due process of law. The landowners appealed, and the irrigation district cross-appealed as to the rejected provisions. The court held for the irrigation district. With respect to the landowners' appeal, their concern was that contract impaired the irrigation district's water rights and thus adversely affected them; that concern was unfounded. The trial judge acted erroneously when it rejected part of the contract, as there was no divestiture of any landowners' property rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment approving most of the irrigation district's contract was affirmed. The judgment rejecting three paragraphs of that contract was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to render judgment in favor of the irrigation district, approving the contract in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff instituted an action against defendant to recover the amount that it had paid for the maintenance of an incompetent in a state hospital. The trial court entered a judgment that denied recovery against defendant. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment for defendant and remanded the action with directions to render a judgment in favor of plaintiff for the cost that it had paid within the statute of limitations under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-206 (Reissue 1943). The court concluded that, at all times that under consideration, the incompetent had her legal settlement in defendant and that her legal settlement was at no time in plaintiff. The court found that the incompetent was incapable, within the meaning of law, of changing her residence or settlement during the entire period that she was physically present in plaintiff. The court further found that there was no evidence that the incompetent ever changed her residence or settlement even if she had become capable of maintaining an intent to change. The court determined that defendant had an obligation to support and maintain the incompetent in the state hospital and that it was obligated to repay plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessee operated the city's airport pursuant to a lease agreement. The pilot's airplane was severely damaged, allegedly due to an unmarked drainage pipe on a ramp at the airport. The district court sustained appellees' demurrers on the ground that the pilot had failed to state a cause of action. The lessee argued that the pilot's notice of appeal was untimely because it was not filed within one month of the order sustaining the demurrers. The court first ruled that the notice of appeal was timely because the appeal period did not begin to run until the district court ruled on the pilot's motion for a rehearing. In reversing the district court's judgment, the court held that the city was operating the airport in a proprietary capacity, even though the Legislature had declared that operation of an airport was a governmental function. Such a determination was a judicial, not a legislative, question. The court also found that because the lessee was an agent of the city, he was subject to suit in the same manner as the city.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that appellants did not establish that the assessed value of the real estate was not fairly and property equalized when considered with the assessment of all other similar properties. The burden was on appellants to establish that the assessment was excessive, which they failed to do. Appellants were not entitled to a tax exemption under 38 U.S.C.S. &sect; 454a because the proceeds of the grant were immediately invested in the real estate. The exemption from taxation in &sect; 454a only applied to payments of benefits due or to become due.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner contested the denial of an injunction in response to her three-cause complaint to prevent the city from undertaking a street project to widen the paved street in front of her properties to four lanes, instead of two. The project would eliminate the right angle parking in front of the landowner's properties and allow only parallel parking. Even though the project was entirely within the city's right of way, the landowner contended that this change in parking decreased the value of her properties and was a taking without due process. The court reversed the incorrect dismissal of &quot;both causes of action&quot; and directed the dismissal of the entire case. The court noted that the city had the police power to maintain its streets in a reasonable manner and that the landowner's right of access to the properties was not impaired if there was reasonable ingress and egress. Because the city's project was within its right of way, was a rational and nondiscriminatory exercise of its police power over traffic safety, and did not unreasonably impair the landowner's access, the court agreed with the denial of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a declaratory action brought by appellees, a city and a county, appellant parking authority challenged the decision of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) that found that the Nebraska Parking Authority Law, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-1701 to 14-1725 (Supp. 1955), was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state legislature provided for the formation of a local parking authority that had the power to use city and county property to construct parking facilities. A private operator could manage the facilities under a lease as specified by the statute. The city and county asserted that the law was invalid and the trial court agreed. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the action. Legislation that applied only to one class of cities was appropriate when there were reasonable differences between the classes. The law was a constitutional use of legislative power because it was a new subject, complete in itself, and the title of the act set out the general provisions of the statute as required by Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 14. The regulation of traffic on the highways and the prevention of bottlenecks in urban areas were statewide concerns over which the state retained authority, even in a home rule city. The leasing provisions of the statute did not defeat its status as legislation in the public interest.</SPAN></P>

The charitable organization subsequently filed a declaratory judgment action to determine whether the contributions were lawfully made. The district court ruled that the contributions were lawful under the power district's general powers. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the contributions were improper because under the general powers granted to the power district, as a public corporation, its revenues had to be devoted to the purposes for which it was being operated. Subsequent contributions made by the power district pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-1106, -1107 (1951), which authorized public corporations to make charitable contributions, were also unlawful because those statutes were unconstitutional due to their failure to articulate reasonable standards to guide the agency that was to administer them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Nebraska Public Auction Law, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 69-801 to 69-817 (Supp. 1955) required the auctioneers to acquire a license and pay taxes before they could sell new merchandise at auction. They sought an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the Law. Defendants claimed that the Law assisted in the collection of taxes and prevented property from escaping taxation. The trial court held that the Law was invalid. On appeal, the court found that the Law was discriminatory and unreasonable. It did not accord the auctioneers equal protection of the law and it abridged their privileges and immunities contrary to the United States Constitution and the Nebraska Constitution. The Auction Law placed arbitrary and unreasonable limitations, regulations, and impositions on the conduct of their lawful business. The regulatory provisions of the statute did not reasonably relate to public health, safety, or welfare. They arbitrarily and unreasonably interfered with private business and imposed unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions on auction sales. The classifications of the statute did not rest upon real differences in situation and circumstances surrounding the members of the class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed a complaint against the Board contesting its assessment of his intangible personal property. The Board dismissed the taxpayer's complaint and fixed the valuation to include an amount the taxpayer had previously deducted. The taxpayer filed an appeal to the trial court, which allowed the taxpayer's deduction. The Board filed an appeal. In affirming the trial court's order, the court concluded that the trial court was correct in its holding. The court found that the method of valuing the stock shares of domestic corporations pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-706 (1943) discriminated against the government obligations. However, the court noted that the legislature had authorized the deduction allowed for under &sect; 77-706. The court reasoned that the legislature's intent in authorizing the deduction was to avoid double taxation as much as possible.</SPAN></P>

The lessee was assessed tax for its lease and the personal property improvements on the lands. The lessee filed a complaint to enjoin the county from collecting taxes. The injunction was granted.

The court held that, while the lessee properly invoked the equitable jurisdiction of the trial court to enjoin the taxes and the state was not a necessary party to the action, the lessee had failed to establish that it was entitled to an injunction. The court held that the lease of public lands was not exempt from taxes in the manner in which the real property held by the federal government was. The lease was considered a real chattel, which rendered the lease personal property and taxable as such pursuant to Neb. Rev.

The result of the removal of the school made the school district ineligible to collect tuition and had the effect of rendering the school nonexistent. The school district contended that the statute and the rule thereunder were an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the Superintendent. The appellate court reversed and held that the last sentence of &sect; 79-307 was unconstitutional as a delegation of legislative authority and that Neb. R. &sect; B, III-3 promulgated thereunder was invalid and unenforceable. The court reasoned that the entire statute was not unconstitutional because the two sentences of the statute could have been separated. The court did not dispute the general rule that the legislature could have delegated some legislative authority to an agency. However, the statute set no limits and was a grant of arbitrary and uncontrolled authority to the Superintendent to remove schools from the approved list.</SPAN></P>

Defendant prayed for dismissal of the complaint together with judgment for the appraised value. On appeal from the trial court's judgment in favor of plaintiffs, the court held that: (1) defendant was not estopped and had not waived her right to claim any value of the crop subsequent to the first day of the lease because there was no evidence that defendant had ever represented that the improvements would be appraised as of that date; (2) any evidence regarding the value of the improvements as of the first day of the lease was wholly immaterial because the county commissioners' appraisement was final and conclusive and not subject to collateral attack; and (3) the court was unable to order a judgment for defendant as requested because defendant did not make any motion for judgment at conclusion of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent state board of educational lands appealed the judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which awarded petitioner taxpayer $ 62,000 in attorney fees payable from the public school lands trust fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Taxpayer sued state board of educational lands, contending that the board was acting improperly with respect to state lands held in trust by it. After taxpayer prevailed in that litigation, the case was remanded for a determining of the proper attorney fees and litigation costs to be awarded him. The judge assigned the matter held that taxpayer was entitled to $ 62,000 in attorney fees, with those fees were to come from the public school lands trust fund. State board appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the judge's ruling and remanded the case for further consideration. The court held that taxpayer's attorney fees should not be paid for out of the public school lands trust fund since the proceeds earned by the board in the course of auctioning off certain public lands were not all due to the litigation initiated by taxpayer. The mere fact that taxpayer litigated as a private citizen and claimed to be litigating on behalf of all citizens was not sufficient in itself to warrant the amount of attorney fees sought or to warrant those fees being paid from the fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former lease holder had valid possession of the school lands in question under a 25-year lease. Upon expiration of the lease, the holder applied for and was issued a new lease pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 72-240 and 72-240.01 (1943). When these statutory provisions were declared unconstitutional, the owner and manager of the lands considered the new lease to be void. An auction was held, and the current lease holders offered the highest bid. After the former lease holder refused to vacate the premises, plaintiffs filed a forcible entry and detainer action seeking restitution of the lands. The court affirmed the judgment for plaintiffs. The court held that when the statutes upon which the holder's lease was issued were found unconstitutional, it was as if the law never existed, and thus the renewed lease was invalid. Further, plaintiffs' petition clearly stated a cause of action for forcible entry based on the requirements of &sect;&sect; 27-1401 and 27-1405. As the former lease holder was unlawfully possessing the premises, the judgment awarding restitution to plaintiffs was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The retail corporation alleged that the restaurant corporation breached their control agreement and as a result excess funds were expended and there was waste and mismanagement. The restaurant corporation alleged, 11 years after the agreement was executed, that it violated Neb. Const. art. XII, &sect; 5, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21-135, and public policy. The court held that the constitution and statute insured against the involuntary loss of the right to vote but did not affect stockholders' rights to lawfully contract with each other with respect to voting rights. A stockholder's control agreement was not ipso facto void. The agreement was valid because it was for the benefit of the corporation, was not fraudulent, and did not violate the constitution or statute. However, the retail corporation's right to sue for damages was derivative and could only be brought in a representative capacity because the alleged wrongs were done to the corporation.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers claimed that the Reorganization of School Districts Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-426.01 et seq., (Reissue 1943) was unconstitutional and that the district was improperly established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Boards, through county committees, both formulated redistricting plans under the Reorganization of School Districts Act whereby the taxpayers' property was located in a newly established district. The Boards held public hearings on the proposed redistricting after which each redistricting proposal received a majority of the votes cast in a special election. The taxpayers claimed that the Act improperly allowed the delegation of legislative authority to the county committees and violated their due process rights. The Boards claimed that the taxpayers were not entitled to an injunction because quo warranto provided an adequate remedy at law. On appeal, the court held that a suit for an injunction was proper in this case because quo warranto could not have been used to test the legality of the assessment and levy of taxes. The court held that the Act did not impermissibly delegate authority because the county committees' actions were restricted and guided by a state committee under various provisions of the Act, under which redistricting proposals had to be submitted to the electorate. The court held that the procedures in the Act satisfied the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The executor brought an action in equity against the treasurer to enjoin the collection of a tax on intangibles it held. The intangibles were stocks in domesticated foreign corporations. The trial court enjoined the collection of the tax and ordered cancellation.

The executor argued that, by domestication, the corporations became corporations organized under the laws of this state and the stock should be valued as such. The court found there was no contention that the corporations complied, or attempted to comply, with the provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-706 (1943), so as to become domestic corporations. The corporations did not surrender their foreign charter or file articles of incorporation with the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator director brought an original action in mandamus seeking to compel respondent auditor to approve his salary vouchers at the rate of $ 6,500 per annum, as authorized by the governor. The auditor contended that payment at the rate authorized by the governor was prohibited by two constitutional provisions, Neb. Const. art. IV, &sect; 25 and Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature amended Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-103, raising the maximum rate of pay for the office of Director of Insurance, effective in April 1951. The director was appointed to the office in December 1951 and sought pay at the new rate because the governor had fixed his salary at that rate. Neb. Const. art. IV, &sect; 25 prohibited a change in the director's salary more often than once every eight years. The legislature had enacted amendments that raised the maximum salary for the office in 1941, 1945, 1947, and 1951. The court held that the raises enacted in 1945 and 1947 were void because they both came within eight years of the 1941 raise. Thus the 1951 raise was valid because it was more than eight years after the last valid raise. Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 19 prohibited a public officer from receiving a raise during his term of office. Although the director's tenure in office was shorter, his term, as set by statute, was from January 1951 to January 1953. Thus he was not permitted to receive the new salary until January 1953, at the earliest.</SPAN></P>

The automatic renewal provision of &sect; 235 was later determined to be violative of the Nebraska Constitution in that it gave the leaseholders a special benefits in the school lands without regard to how much or whether others were willing to pay more. Under the authorities holding the provisions unconstitutional, the board determined that the leaseholders renewal leases were void. The leaseholders brought suit seeking an injunction. The district court entered judgment in favor of the board. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the board had a duty of putting the land up for auction based on the invalidity of the provisions of &sect; 235. The court further held that the record reasonably established that the leaseholders were sent notices of the expiration of their respective leases by the board as &sect; 235 provided.

The blanket mill levy tax was discriminatory as one levied upon one district of the county for the exclusive benefit and local purpose of other districts and as not levied uniformly and proportionately.

The court found that a canal company was under the obligation to keep its canal in proper repair and proper condition to furnish the water users with water, and if this was properly done, the municipality would have no more right to complain than it would if it were a natural stream. The court also held that users of water from a natural stream had the right to have the water of such stream, if they had appropriated it prior to the time that the village or city was laid out or established upon its borders, kept within its banks in order to give them the full benefit of their prior appropriations. The court held that the ordinance was invalid when applied to the ditch in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Omaha and Council Bluffs, Nebraska were provided interstate transpiration of passengers by streetcar by a bus company. The bus company had intracity rights in both cities, but the bus company's rights were terminated in Council Bluffs, and the transit company was granted the rights. The Interstate Commerce Commission granted the transit company and the bus company temporary rights to operate as common carriers for hire between Omaha and Council Bluffs. Omaha denied the transit company's application to turn at a certain street within Omaha, and the transit company contested on the grounds that the bus company had always been allowed to turn at the street. Omaha passed the Ordinances to make transit company's desired turn a violation of law. The transit company filed a declaratory judgment action against Omaha. The trial court concluded that the ordinances were valid, and the transit company appealed. The court affirmed, holding that Omaha had the right to prescribe reasonable regulations for the control of traffic on its streets as a matter of public safety. Even if the Ordinances interfered with interstate commerce, they did not deny the transit company equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor defendants, the city, the light, water, ice, and sewer commissioner, and a bond purchaser.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city billed the taxpayer as provided by Grand Island, Neb., Ordinance No. 2289 for water and sewerage charges relating to building that he owned. The sewerage charge was admittedly erroneous, but the taxpayer tendered the amount of the water charge. The city refused to accept the payment unless the sewerage charge was also paid, and it notified the taxpayer that if the bill was not paid, it would discontinue service. The taxpayer then sought to restrain the city from discontinuing his water service. The trial court found in favor of defendants, and the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the action of the city officials was within their authority. The ordinance, part of the city's home rule charter, was not unconstitutional because the sewerage service charges did not amount to a special assessment for a general improvement, and the ordinance imposing a service fee for sewer use based on the amount of water used did not deprive the taxpayer of property without due process of law. Moreover, the regulation allowing the discontinuance of water service for delinquent payment was not unreasonable and was permitted under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-503 (Reissue 1943).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's order by reversing its judgment taxing costs to the city, but otherwise affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessee and assignee sought a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties to a school land lease that was issued by the State of Nebraska to the lessee, and a decree compelling the Board to approve the assignment of the lease and to issue a renewal lease to the assignee for a new term. The Board's general demurrer was sustained, the lessee and assignee elected not to plead further, and their action was dismissed. On review the court reversed, finding that (1) Neb. Comp. Stat. &sect; 72-220 (1929) was a recording act that gave information and notice to the State as to the identity of the owner of the lease; (2) when the lease was made, the State assured the lessee that he had the right to dispose of it and to have its assignment recorded if the lessee was not in default of any required payment to the State; (3) the State could not change that right by subsequently enacting legislation; (4) the lessee and the assignee were entitled to have the assignment accepted and recorded in the Board's office and records; but (5) the assignee was only entitled to a renewal of the lease as an assignee of the lessee.</SPAN></P>

After the police picked up the car, they refused to release it. The dealer filed a replevin action. The trial court entered a judgment for the dealer. The court held that a purchaser, such as the owner, who received possession of a car without obtaining the certificate, as required the Act Relating to Title and Transfer of Motor Vehicles 1939, Neb. Rev. Stat. ch. 60, art. 1 (1943), acquired no title or ownership. A subsequent purchaser for value of the car, such as the dealer, who complied with the Act, obtained title and ownership. Further, the dealer's title and ownership were superior to any rights that the owner might have. Moreover, statements made by the dealer's president in regards to his stockholder status at the time he acted as a notary were not admissible as substantive proof. As there was no other competent evidence, the trial court was correct in not submitting the issue of notarial acts to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city sought to permanently enjoin the lessee from proceeding with the construction, maintenance, and operation of a trailer park. The city contended that such use was contrary to the zoning ordinances for the area. The subject real estate was zoned as residential. The court held that an injunction was the proper remedy to prevent the erection of buildings in violation of a municipal ordinance. The lessee contended that he had established a non-conforming use of his premises as a trailer park prior to the amendment of the city of its zoning ordinances. The court held that a zoning ordinance could not operate retroactively to deprive a property owner of his previously vested rights. However, the leasing of the land with the intent to use the land for a use then permissible under a zoning ordinance did not prevent the city from changing its zoning ordinance. The property was held subject to the city's lawful exercise of its police power. The lessee failed to prove that the zoning ordinance was unreasonably and arbitrary. The lessee's financial loss was not a concern if the zoning classification was fair.</SPAN></P>

It found that the city had the authority to regulate the gas company and its ordinance requiring the gas company to maintain all pipelines, up to and including the meters, was validly enacted. The court also found that the gas company had notice of the existence of a dangerous condition as a tenant in the building had contacted the gas company about the strong odor of gas and that an agent of the gas company had inspected the premises. In addition, a chemical engineer found dangerous levels of gas in the soil near a garage next to the building and, in the garage near the back room, the engineer exposed the service line and found it had corroded.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held the ordinances were not repugnant to the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and overruled a motion to dismiss the intervenors, a local retailer's association and a furrier association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporations displayed samples of their products in local hotel rooms to obtain retail orders. The City passed ordinances that created a tax and other conditions on the corporations. However, the ordinances did not apply to local retailers. The corporations paid the tax under protest, but brought an action to restrain the enforcement of the ordinances. Two associations of local retailers intervened. The trial court overruled the corporations' motion to dismiss the petitions in intervention and decreed that the ordinances were valid. On appeal, the court held that the corporations' motion to dismiss the petitions in intervention should have been sustained and that the drummer decisions were still good law. The court concluded that the ordinances were discriminatory and unreasonable. The Commerce Clause prohibited the regulation of interstate commerce. The corporations' solicitation of orders for sales in another state necessarily required interstate shipment, their activities were not an identifiable occupation of a local character and a doing of business within the City that was segregable and separable, and they were not subject to taxation or licensing by the City.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 86 to be valid. The sheriff had brought the action for a declaratory judgment to have ch. 86 declared unconstitutional. At the time of the opinion, the act appeared as Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 33-117, 33-117.01, 47-112.01, 47-113, and 47-113.01 (1943).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A sheriff alleged that the Douglas County jail housed federal, state, county, and city prisoners. It was conceded that Douglas County was the only county in Nebraska having a population in excess of 200,000 inhabitants. The sheriff did not challenge the right of the legislature to enact such legislation if it was made applicable to all counties. The objection was that it applied to one county alone and was therefore special legislation, not a general law. The court held that for purposes of legislation, the legislature could classify counties when the classification rested upon reasonable differences of situation or circumstances that called for distinctive legislation for the class. Because a class of counties was established on the basis of population in such a manner that other counties may in the future enter the class without additional legislation, the law was considered to be general in its nature. The court held that the act in question was not unconstitutional because of the fact that it was presently applicable to Douglas County alone. Because reasons that were not superficial or baseless existed for a legislative classification, the courts could not properly interfere.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XV, &sect;&sect; 13, 14, 15, was not in conflict with any federal law and was constitutional as within the police power of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The labor union and the iron works company entered into a &quot;union shop&quot; agreement whereby the employer agreed to discharge any person that did not remain an active member of the union. An amendment to the Nebraska constitution (the amendment), codified at Neb. Const. art. XV, &sect;&sect; 13, 14, 15, was enacted which prohibited such agreements. Thereafter, the iron works company refused to discharge an employee that was not a union member on the basis that the amendment invalidated the union shop agreement. A judgment was entered in favor of defendants as to the validity of the amendment, and the labor union appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment and sanctioned the employer's refusal to discharge the employee. The court held that the amendment did not restrain a union member's exercise of the civil rights of assembly and speech guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend. I; the amendment was permissible general welfare legislation that was rationally related to a reasonable state objective; the amendment did not arbitrarily and unreasonably impair the obligations of existing contracts; and, the amendment did not operate to deny union members' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcoholic liquor (DUI). The county court refused to consider one of the prior plea-based convictions offered by the State for purposes of enhancing appellant's sentence. The district court reversed and remanded finding that the county court's failure to consider the second DUI was clearly erroneous. Appellant appealed. The court concluded that the fact that appellant had previously been convicted of DUI was irrelevant to guilt or innocence and was relevant only to the sentence to be meted out. Remanding the case with directions to sentence appellant according to law did not violate double jeopardy principles. The two waiver forms signed by appellant were sufficient to meet the State's burden of proof that appellant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived her rights to counsel. The determination that the second plea-based conviction was invalid for enhancement purposes was clearly erroneous. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The parole board ruled that on the burglary and theft charges, appellant was not entitled to credit for the time spent in jail. The court affirmed a summary judgment for appellee state, appellee chairman of the state parole board, and other individuals, in appellant prisoner's suit for appellees' refusal to give him credit for time served because his tort claim was for false imprisonment, a type of claim barred by governmental immunity under the state tort claims act, Neb.

Appellant alleged he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel during enhancement and lower court erred in denying the right to counsel of choice by refusing continuance. The court determined the lower court's decision to deny the continuance because appellant's counsel was not prepared at trial. It said that was not an abuse of discretion when the matter was before the lower court for nine months and a previous continuance had already been granted. The court explained the exercise of the right to counsel was subject to the necessities of judicial administration. The court noted appellant had many opportunities in five months to hire private counsel and chose not to do so until the evening before trial. The court found appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel at the enhancement hearing by allowing him to testify because the evidence of prior crimes would have been able to be sufficiently proved by appellee's exhibits of authenticated copies of prior criminal proceedings that established appellant's previous multiple incarceration for felonies.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners were owners of certain lots of a subdivision. Petitioners had requested a reduction in the assessed valuation on the basis that a swine confinement facility entitled them to a 30-percent locational discount. The court found that the commission did not err in refusing to find that the board was bound by the principles of res judicata because an exception to the doctrine of res judicata applied. Neb. Rev.

The trial court upheld the condition. Appellant challenged the decision, alleging that appellee lacked jurisdictional authority to prohibit an individual from working on the premises and that prohibiting an individual from working in the licensed premises as a condition of the issuance of the license was discriminatory, arbitrary, unreasonable, and not supported by the record. The court concluded that the Liquor Control Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-101 et. seq. empowered the appellee to issue a license subject to certain restrictions or conditions so long as those restrictions and conditions were reasonably necessary to the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state and to the promotion and fostering of temperance in the consumption of alcohol.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services sought review of an order of the County Court for Saunders County (Nebraska), sitting as a juvenile court, which required it to make 10 - 12 unannounced visits at both day and night at the home of three juveniles, by a certain date, to see if their appellee mother was properly supervising them. The Department argued that the order was not authorized by statute and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, the mother, the State of Nebraska, and another relative of the juveniles, did not make an appearance in the appeal. On appeal, the court found that the record supported the finding that the unannounced visits would be in the juveniles' best interest, because they would permit the Department to make certain the mother was not allowing unauthorized males to live in and visit the home and that she was not enabling her 15 year old daughter to evade the probation office's electronic monitoring system. The court held that, under Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, it did not have jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-288 (Reissue 1993) therefore, for purposes of this case, it would assume that &sect; 43-288 was constitutional. The court noted that &sect; 43-288 gave the juvenile court broad discretion to set conditions requiring the Department to properly supervise children, adjudicated as juveniles under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-247(3)(Reissue 1993), who have been permitted to remain in their homes pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-284 or 43-286. Thus, the court held that the order was a proper exercise of the juvenile court's authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the county court convicted defendant of producing or distributing obscene material, a Class I misdemeanor, in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-813(1) (Reissue 1995). A District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) judgment affirmed the conviction and $ 1,000 sentence. Defendant appealed. The issues were county court evidentiary rulings and the core question of whether defendant's self-produced videotape was obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tape showed defendant in a space traveler/clown makeup for 14.5 minutes and then masturbating for 1.5 minutes. Defendant should have been allowed to introduce evidence of cable-visions rules, within which defendant claimed to be trying to stay, to show his lack of &sect; 28-813(1) intent to knowingly prepare, produce, or distribute obscene material. Defendant was prejudiced by that exclusion. Dismissal and not an new trial was warranted since there was not sufficient evidence to convict. The appeals court had to de novo reexamine for obscenity. The State had the burden of proving all three prongs of the Miller test: whether (1) the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (2) the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (3) the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The whole &quot;work&quot; examined was that tried by the party's consent and not another version. The whole work did not satisfy the first two Miller tests and was indecent but not obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals reversed the judgment and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city filed its petition after the juvenile had dangerously operated a motor vehicle without a valid license. The Department argued that the lower court was without jurisdiction to order commitment of the juvenile to a treatment center. The lower court's order required the juvenile to appear before it upon his discharge. The court reversed this part of the order because the lower court was without the power to order the juvenile's appearance until all of the elements of due process were complied with. The lower court's order also required the Department's director to notify the lower court before the juvenile was release. The court also reversed this portion of the order for lack of jurisdiction. The lower court exceeded its authority when it attempted to limit the juvenile's release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the District Court for Dakota County (Nebraska), which denied his motions to suppress physical evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant and the subsequent introduction of that evidence and convicted him of possession of methamphetamine and/or cocaine with intent to deliver and unauthorized possession of diazepam pursuant to a jury verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his convictions for possession with intent to deliver and unauthorized possession. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress items which were seized from his home pursuant to a search warrant and in admitting those items into evidence at trial over objection. The court found that the police officer's affidavit was the entire basis presented to the magistrate in support of the request for a search warrant. The court stated that the affidavit, which described a vehicle stop, did not explain why defendant's home should have been searched. The court found that the facts of defendant's arrest hours earlier, of the discovery of drugs without an indication of the amount or an inference that the amount was other than that consistent with personal use, and of a prior conviction at some unspecified time in the past did not support the issuance of the search warrant. The court held that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause and that the fruits of that search were not admissible. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court's orders overruling defendant's motions to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of burglary, first degree criminal trespass, third degree assault on an officer, and tampering with physical evidence. On direct appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. After an evidentiary hearing was held upon defendant's motion for postconviction relief, the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that after reviewing the entire record of defendant's trial and all evidence offered against him, it could not conclude that defendant had demonstrated a reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted him had it not been for his trial counsel's violation of and apparent unfamiliarity with Neb. Ct. R. of Prac. 609. The court found that a review of the entire record lead the court to the conclude that defendant's jury convictions were rendered with overwhelming record support. Further, the court concluded that defendant had failed to satisfy the second prong of the Strickland test, and, thus, his request for postconviction relief premised upon his trial counsel's deficient performance was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee wife sought to enforce a child support order she obtained in Wisconsin against appellant husband in Nebraska. The husband filed a lawsuit in the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) alleging that the child support order was invalid because the Wisconsin court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that it was error for the trial court to sustain the wife's special appearance since her purpose was to object to subject matter jurisdiction, and not personal jurisdiction.  Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-516.01. By alleging that Wisconsin lacked personal jurisdiction over him, the husband alleged sufficient facts in his declaratory judgment action to contest the validity of the Wisconsin support order. Under the divisibility doctrine, even if the wife was domiciled in Wisconsin, the child support order was still subject to examination by a Nebraska court. Rather than ruling on the wife's special appearance as though it was a demurrer, the trial court should have overruled her special appearance and simply let the case proceed to the next step. Moreover, the husband's action for declaratory judgment should not have been dismissed in the course of ruling upon the wife's special appearance. Accordingly, the court reversed the sustaining of the wife's special appearance, reversed the dismissal of the lawsuit, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue in the case was whether parts of the human body, specifically teeth, could constitute dangerous instruments under Nebraska's second degree assault statute. On review, the court reversed the second degree assault conviction, but otherwise affirmed. The court found that declaring body parts dangerous instruments made the increased penalty for using a dangerous instrument meaningless and created ambiguity, if not outright duplication, between second and third degree assault under Nebraska law. The court held, therefore, as a matter of law, that defendant's teeth could not have been considered a dangerous instrument for the purpose of convicting him of second degree assault under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-309. Because the record showed that defendant's teeth were the only thing the jury could have found to be a dangerous instrument, the court found it necessary to reverse the jury's finding that defendant was guilty of second degree assault.</SPAN></P>
