</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of murder in the second degree and not guilty of violations of the Uniform Firearms Act. She was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. On appeal, she contended that the evidence was insufficient to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed, finding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict where a witness observed appellant with a gun and saw victim staggering after it was fired. Appellant next argued that the not-guilty verdict on the Uniform Firearms indictment was inconsistent with the guilty verdict on the murder indictment and that such inconsistency was reversible error. The court noted that even if the two verdicts were logically inconsistent, such inconsistency alone could not be grounds for a new trial or for reversal. Finally, appellant asserted that the trial court erred when it sentenced her to two years' incarceration without setting a minimum sentence. While the court agreed, it found that the issue had not been properly preserved for appellate review because she did not raise it at the time of her sentencing.</SPAN></P>

One morning he shot and killed the man, his wife, and daughter as they slept in their homes in Pennsylvania. Defendant was arrested in Ohio, extradited and tried by a jury. He was convicted of three counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and argued that the trial court erred in rulings it made regarding venue and the jury venire, and in its charge to the jury. The court affirmed the convictions for first degree murder, vacated the imposition of the death sentence, and remanded for imposition of legal sentences. The court held that the trial court did not err in its denial of a change of venue motion because enough time had passed between the murders and the trial for the publicity to ebb and there was no prejudice to defendant. The court also held that the keyman jury selection process was complied with, and was not prejudicial to defendant. Finally, the court held that under Furman v. Georgia, the death penalty could not be imposed on defendant under the Pennsylvania death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of passing a worthless check under 18 P.S. &sect; 4854 (1972-73). Appellant's conviction was affirmed by the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), and appellant sought the instant review. Appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict of guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant went to a check cashing agency and presented for payment a check of the Farragut Hall Corporation, drawn on the First National Bank of Philadelphia, which was made payable to appellant. The check was dishonored and it was determined that the bank had been defunct for 15 years, and that the corporation was non-existent. Appellant was charged with passing a worthless check under 18 P.S. &sect; 4854 (1972-73). After a demurrer to the commonwealth's evidence was denied, the defense rested and the verdict of guilt entered. Appellant was convicted and sought review, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. The court reversed and discharged appellant, finding that it was the intention of the legislature to restrict the statutory scheme of proof to prosecutions of drawers or makers where there was an obvious reason to conclude that they possessed the requisite knowledge and intent. The court determined that the direct evidence was insufficient to prove two of the three elements of the crime and further, that the prosecution could not properly rely upon the statutory inference to withstand the demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court affirming appellant's conviction of passing a worthless check, and discharged appellant. The court held that the state had failed to prove appellant acted with the intent to defraud and that she knew at the time that the maker or drawer had insufficient funds in, or credit with the depository for the payment of such a check.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed the decision of the Orphans' Court Division (Pennsylvania) sustaining appellee estate's position that items representing &quot;income in respect of a decedent&quot; be devalued to reflect state and federal income taxes paid by the estate and that certain additional insurance benefits were exempt from inheritance tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the executors of appellee estate filed the estate's Pennsylvania inheritance tax return, the appraiser for appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania increased the valuation of two items on the return and included a third item previously omitted. The difference in valuation of the two re-appraised items represented federal and state income tax properly paid on the items by the estate since they were &quot;income in respect of a decedent,&quot; while the third item represented additional insurance benefits. Appellee's executors thereafter petitioned the court to reduce appellant's appraisement, arguing that appellant would receive a windfall if the two items were not devalued to reflect income taxes paid by the estate. After the court sustained appellee's position, appellant contested the ruling. The court affirmed in part, holding that since it was unclear whether the legislature intended to impose double taxation in this fashion, the court must presume that no double taxation was intended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination in favor of appellee since there was no affirmative indication of legislative intent to impose double taxation, but reversed and remanded the determination regarding the additional insurance proceeds for further analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), which found that the obscenity statute,&nbsp;18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees exhibited two pornographic motions pictures to the public and were arrested for obscenity and nuisance under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903 (1974), and 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6504 (1974), respectively. The trial court found that &sect; 5903 was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I, and therefore it had no legal basis to grant appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania an injunction against future showing. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court held that under the U.S. Supreme Court's five part Miller test for obscenity, the statute was unconstitutional because it did not define the conduct that was to be forbidden specifically by state law. The court also determined that because &sect; 5903 was unconstitutional, the trial court did not have any authority to grant appellant an injunction to prevent appellees from further showings of the motion pictures. The court affirmed the lower court, and dismissed appellant's challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was charged with murder, sought review of the judgment of (Pennsylvania) trial court, which ordered appellant committed under 50 P.S. &sect; 4408 (1969) of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act until he either became competent to stand trial or ceased to be dangerous to himself or others, even though medical experts had testified that appellant would probably never become competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with murder after a 1960 stabbing incident. Appellant, who was found incompetent to stand trial, was committed to a state hospital pursuant to 50 P.S. &sect; 4408 (1969) of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act. In 1974, three medical experts testified that appellant, because of his paranoid schizophrenia, was potentially dangerous to himself and others and would probably never become competent to stand trial. However, the court below ordered appellant committed until he either became competent to stand trial or ceased to be dangerous to himself or others. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded appellant's order of commitment under &sect; 4408. The court held that a defendant could only be committed under &sect; 4408 for a reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he would attain that capacity in the foreseeable future. Since appellant's incompetency caused what amounted to an indefinite commitment, the court below, on remand, was directed to either civilly commit appellant under 50 P.S. &sect; 4406 or release him.</SPAN></P>

The disciplinary board, after reviewing the report of the hearing committee, agreed with its decision and petitioned the court to disbar respondent from the practice of law. On review of the disciplinary board's decision, the court held that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the findings of the hearing committee. In addition, the court ruled that the mere acquittal of a crime would not be a bar to a suspension of the attorney's right to practice or his disbarment for unprofessional conduct based upon the same acts or conduct involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the testimony established that the stabbing of the victim was in self-defense and that the judgment of sentence should be arrested and should be discharged. The court held that under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 505, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not acting in self-defense. The court held that the evidence showed that the state had met its burden in proving that defendant had not acted in self-defense. The trial testimony showed that defendant and the victim were old friends, who were accustomed to engaging in a rough kind of horseplay that involved verbal and physical abuse, and that the victim was unarmed at the time of the scuffle. There was the victim's conditional threat that if you even speak to me tomorrow I am going to kill you, but that was insufficient to justify defendant's belief of the necessity to kill in order to protect himself.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a direct appeal from his judgment of sentence in the trial court (Pennsylvania) for voluntary manslaughter under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2503. Defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support his claim; that contradictory expert testimony, a medical doctor's testimony regarding ballistics, and inflammatory X-rays were improperly admitted into evidence; and that &sect; 2503 violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for involuntary manslaughter under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2503 based on sufficient evidence. The court held that no knife was located at the scene, thus precluding defendant's self-defense argument. The court also held that the state's expert witnesses' testimony regarding the distance of the fatal shot was not contradictory and improperly admitted into evidence because after reviewing the experts' testimony no conflict existed. The court determined that an examining doctor, while only qualified as to medical matters, was qualified to testify regarding the ballistics of the distance of the fatal shot, because precedent permitted examining medical doctors to testify regarding the distance, and the jury was to determine its weight. The court further ruled that X-ray photographs depicting the victim's wounds were properly admitted into evidence without cautionary instructions because no timely objection was made at trial and black and white X-rays were not very inflammatory. Finally, the court held that defendant's claim that &sect; 2503 was unconstitutional lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

I right to hold public office. Appellant had served as chief deputy recorder of deeds for the county, but resigned the post when elected controller. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's complaint in his action of quo warranto against appellee county controller. Though holding a political office was a form of protected political expression, the court found that the purpose of &sect; 602(b) was to prevent any of the named officers from being in the position of auditing their own book and that the two year period corresponded with the two year statute of limitations for prosecuting public officials after they left office, under 19 P.S. &sect; 211. As chief deputy, appellant was at times required to act in the name of the recorder of deeds, and the possible abuse of the position was the compelling state interest at which &sect; 602(b) was directed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer challenged the order of the commonwealth court (Pennsylvania) which denied appellant's request for permanent injunctive relief from his pending court martial, which was ordered by appellee commissioner pursuant to the Administrative Code, 1929, Pa. Laws 177, art. VII, &sect; 711, as amended 1967, Pa. Laws 671, &sect; 1, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 251 (1974-75), as a result of allegations of impropriety against appellant.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied appellant's request for injunctive relief, and appellant challenged the lower court's order. The court held that while the Code had not violated appellant's constitutional rights to a fair hearing and was not an unconstitutional delegation of power by the legislature, appellant was entitled to permanent injunctive relief because when the Code was implemented by the Pennsylvania State Police Field Regulation 3.03-E, the functions of appellee commissioner were unconstitutionally commingled. The court stated that it was unconstitutional to give appellee commissioner the right to prosecute a court-martial hearing and also allow him to have final judicial authority in determining appellant's guilt or innocence. Accordingly, the court granted appellant a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

They claimed that the forfeiture clause of the Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PURTA), 72 P.S. &sect; 3271 et seq. (1975) violated Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4 (1968). The court affirmed. It ruled that because the constitution expressly authorized the enactment of the special PURTA tax, but did not specify the nature of the tax, or the details of its imposition, collection, and distribution, it could be assumed that the legislature had the freedom to make such reasonable provisions. Thus, it was not necessary that each local taxing authority receive a share of the tax proceeds in all circumstances. It was sufficient to provide for the apportionment of shares among local taxing authorities, which had fulfilled all reasonable requirements. The timely filing of the annual report required by PURTA imposed a reasonable condition to the receipt of distributive shares and thus, did not violate the Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4 mandate that such tax &quot;shall be distributed&quot; annually.</SPAN></P>

Section 3371 allowed all causes of actions to survive after the death of a defendant except actions for slander or libel. Plaintiff argued to the court that this exception for libel was arbitrary and a denial of equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions. The court held that the distinction set up by &sect; 3371 was arbitrary and that no policy or legislative purpose was furthered by the exception for defamation. The distinction did not promote the purpose of a libel action that was to restore plaintiff's good name by providing him with money damages.

After Pennsylvania adopted a new presumption that unless otherwise specifically mentioned adopted children would be treated the same as natural children for purposes of benefiting from wills, appellants brought another action seeking to participate. The trial court denied their request to participate. The court affirmed the decision and held that res judicata applied to the later suit where four identities were established. The four identities were (1) identity of the thing or subject matter sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of parties to the action: and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the parties suing or being sued.

Appellant, who was prosecuted under the activities of the special attorney, challenged summary judgment in favor of the validity of the appointment, which superseded the District Attorney of Philadelphia. The court affirmed the order on the basis that special attorney's powers were derived from appellee's action pursuant to the Administrative Code of 1929 &sect; 907, 71 P.S. &sect; 297 (1962). Pursuant to &sect; 907, the president judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia informed appellee that he believed the investigation that had been undertaken by a grand jury was a proper case &quot;for the Commonwealth's intervention,&quot; and requested that he appoint a special attorney.

The constitutionality of the No-fault Act was sustained because plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proving that statute was clearly, palpably, and plainly a violation of the Constitution. Whether a litigant retained his common-law remedy under the statute, rested on whether he was included in the list of exceptions in &sect;301(a). A limitation of recovery to a sum less than actual damage would be in conflict with the right to remedy by due course of law, but if the right to the remedy was eliminated by the legislature, there would be no violation. Nothing in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;11 prevented the extinguishing of a cause of action. The legislative classification was sustained because it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In limiting plaintiff's petition to the statute, the court rejected plaintiff's positions and concluded that the statute was compatible with both the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former wife sought review of an order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which declared two sections of the Divorce Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 11 and Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 46, unconstitutional as contrary to the Equal Rights Amendment, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 28. The wife had filed an action for divorce against appellee former husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife initiated a cause of action for divorce from bed and board against her husband. Pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 46, the husband was ordered to pay alimony and preliminary counsel fees. He was subsequently ordered to pay additional preliminary counsel fees and expenses. The husband asserted that the trial court had erred by refusing to permit him to cross-examine his wife during the hearings about the disposition of her own estate and contended that the award of $ 5,000 attorney's fees was an abuse of the trial court's discretion. The superior court concluded that the statutory provisions under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect;&sect; 11, 46 impermissibly discriminated on the basis of sex and were void as repugnant to the Pennsylvania Constitution. The court reversed and remanded the cause to the superior court because sua sponte consideration of issues exceeded its proper appellate function of deciding controversies presented to it. The court held that sua sponte consideration of the issues deprived counsel of the opportunity to brief and argue the issues, and the attorney general was denied the opportunity of appearing and responding to the constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the superior court because the constitutionality of sections of the divorce law was never question by the parties.

After being charged with burglary, larceny, and receiving stolen goods, defendant moved to suppress his pre-trial admissions. The trial court granted the motion but subsequently allowed the prosecution to use those same statements to impeach defendant during trial. Defendant was convicted.

Stat. &sect; 3271 et seq., appellant public utility paid a state-wide property tax upon the depreciated value of its realty. The lower court held that because the PURTA tax was supposedly in lieu of local property taxes, it was unconstitutional as inconsistent with Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, which provided that special taxes replaced gross receipt taxes. On appeal, the court held that the legislature's expression in 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3278 that the tax not be interpreted to &quot;replace&quot; the gross receipts tax and its subsequent reenactment of the gross receipts tax, 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8101, did not render PURTA in any sense irreconcilable with Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4 . Section 3278 was included in PURTA to assure that it would not be interpreted as impliedly repealing the gross receipts tax and thereby adversely affecting this source of general commonwealth revenues. Thus, the PURTA tax was a special tax imposed specially for purposes of art. VIII, &sect; 4. Accordingly, payment of that tax by a public utility and distribution by the commonwealth to local taxing authorities was in lieu of local real estate taxation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and sought review, contending that the statute's more severe sanction permitted for a male offender than for the female offender for the same conduct violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the sanction imposed against the female was limited to the payment of a $ 100 fine, but the male offender was liable for the fine, lying-in expenses, child's maintenance during its minority, and funeral expenses if the child dies at birth or during the continuance of an order. The court vacated and remanded for resentencing, as no rational basis existed to justify the distinction in treatment because both parties were equally culpable and equally responsible for the child's care and maintenance. The court concluded that the remaining sentencing section providing for a $ 100 fine was severable and that defendant should be resentenced under that provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth prosecuted appellant for first-degree murder. Appellant asserted that his confession should have been excluded because it was the product of an illegal arrest.

The court held that appellant's assertion that his confession was a result of the delay between his arrest and arraignment was without merit. The court stated that delay in arraignment caused by the necessity to investigate appellant's story was permissible. The court found that the search warrant for appellant's car was not defective. The court held that the warrant was based on the officer's testimony gained from speaking with an eyewitness who had given a description of the car. The court further found that the trial judge did not commit prejudicial error in his charge because he recited facts brought out on cross-examination and instructed the jury to use their recollection and he called appellant's motion for mistrial frivolous at a sidebar.

The court concluded that the trial court properly considered the loss of value in appellant's liquor license resulting from the condemnation. That loss resulted from the destruction of a property interest within the meaning of the United States Constitution and Pennsylvania Constitution, and the Eminent Domain Code, 26 P.S. &sect; 1-101 et seq., (1964).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A nursing facility for multiple handicapped children was being constructed on certain land. After prior litigation concerning the zoning of the land, appellees, opponents of the nursing facility, filed an action in equity seeking to enforce the court's decision in earlier litigation and enjoin further construction of the facility. Appellees sought to have the building permits revoked, the structure as it then existed demolished, and the award of money damages to the individual appellees. Appellants, individuals, the city, and the financing bank, argued that the zoning ordinance was valid. The trial court agreed with appellants and held that the zoning ordinance was valid. The lower court reversed the trial court and held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as constituting &quot;spot zoning.&quot; The court granted allocatur, and reversed the lower court. The court determined that the ordinance was not &quot;spot zoning,&quot; and was therefore valid. The ordinance did not create an &quot;island&quot; of substantially different use without proper justification.

Appellant challenged the suspension, and the lower court upheld the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that reference to the word &quot;arrest&quot; in &sect; 624.1(a) was not a reference to a lawful arrest and that appellee had the authority to suspend appellant's license even in the absence of a lawful arrest. The court found that had the legislature intended otherwise, it would have stated &quot;lawful arrest&quot; as it had done in other statutes.

The prospective purchaser left the premises and met a friend downstairs who began yelling at the occupants of the dealer's apartment. When the friend walked to his car, a shotgun blast coming from the apartment killed him. Defendant was arrested and later confessed to the crime after failing a polygraph test. At trial, defendant took the stand and corroborated the confession. Defendant was convicted and sentenced, and appeal went directly to the court. Defendant contended that the confession was improperly admitted into evidence because it was obtained during an unnecessary delay between her arrest and arraignment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence. The court provided that defendant's corroborative testimony disentitled her from claiming that an error in admitting the confession constituted grounds for reversal. Additionally, the imposition of the minimum sentence was proper because the statute proscribing the imposition of minimum sentences for women was held unconstitutional subsequent to defendant's sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court also concluded that the legislative program was reasonably designed to effectuate the law's public purpose. The court found that the argument that private gain to nursing homes somehow outweighed the public purpose of the law was meritless because it was reasonably designed to yield benefits to the public.

He was convicted and his sentence upheld by the superior court. The court reversed the conviction. The court held that the statute was impermissibly vague. The supreme court had held that a statute prohibiting treating the flag contemptuously was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The difference between &quot;treats contemptuously&quot; and &quot;casts contempt upon&quot; was constitutionally insignificant. The court also held that defendant's conviction for &quot;defiling&quot; the flag was also unconstitutional for vagueness.

On review, defendant argued that bail was fixed at an unreasonably high figure, causing him to remain incarcerated and severely hampering him in the preparation of his defense, and that the denial of his petition for a change of court-appointed counsel was error. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that although all offenses are bailable, the right to release before trial is conditioned upon the accused giving adequate assurance he will appear for trial. In light of defendant's flight from the Commonwealth following the slaying, bail could have been properly denied him. Thus, he could not complain when bail was actually set, albeit at a comparatively high figure. Similarly, the court ruled that defendant's petition for a change of court-appointed counsel was properly denied since an indigent is not entitled to free counsel of his choice.

The state supreme court ruled that the classification was valid because it related to a valid state interest in protecting the availability of benefits to those teachers who joined the system pursuant to the Act of 1956, which was reasonably insured by the exemption for those teachers.

S. &sect; 1201. Appellants claimed that a renewal contract which contained an agency-shop provision requiring all employees, even non-members of the union, to pay dues was permitted under the grandfather clause of &sect; 904. Section 904 banned agency-shop provisions in collective bargaining agreements effective after January, 1970. The renewal contract was effective as of July, 1970, so appellants argued that it should be considered as an extension of the original contract, which was effective in October 1967. The problem, as asserted by appellee, was that the original agreement had exempted appellee, as an existing employee, from the agency-shop requirement. Thus, appellee asserted that the renewal contract was not an extension of the first contract. The court agreed, finding that the second contract was not an example of continued bargaining because only appellee was affected. The court affirmed the appellate court decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, intestate heirs of the decedent, challenged an order of a trial court (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee church's request for reargument and held that the Pennsylvania Mortmain Statute, 1947 Pa. Laws 89, violated the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, and the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heirs argued that the trial court erred in granted the request for reargument where the trial court had already granted the relief sought by the church. The court disagreed. The request for a reargument was made within a reasonable period of time and before the time for filing an appeal had expired. Where the trial court attempted to bring all the facts and relevant law before it upon petition for rehearing filed within the appropriate period of time, it was to have been commended for its attempt to insure the just and comprehensive resolution of the case. As to the merits of the ruling, the court affirmed the trial court on the basis of an opinion in a case filed that same day -- Estate of Cavill, 329 A.2d 503 (1974). Cavill held that the Pennsylvania Mortmain Statute, 1947 Pa. Laws 89, was violative of equal protection. Affirmation was required even where the trial court came to the correct result for the wrong reason.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife sought review of an order from the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), affirming a trial court's order dismissing appellant's divorce petition for a lack of jurisdiction. Appellant claimed that a residency requirement under the Act of 1929, 23 P.S. &sect; 16 (1974), penalized the exercise of her constitutional right of interstate travel and was subject to strict scrutiny under the compelling state interest test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife and appellee husband moved from their home state. They later moved back, and appellant filed for divorce after being in the state only four months. Appellee asserted that appellant failed to meet the residency requirement of the Act of 1929, 23 P.S. &sect; 16 (1974), and that the court lacked jurisdiction. The trial court sustained appellee's objections. The appellate court affirmed. The reviewing court granted allocutor. The court affirmed, finding the imposition of a period of residence as a prerequisite to the exercise of the right to seek a dissolution of the marital relationship is not such a penalty upon interstate travel as to call for application of the &quot;compelling state interest&quot; test. Thus, in applying a rational basis test, the court found the state had an interest in the marriage relationship and in avoiding serious problems inherent in a divorce decree issued without a jurisdictional basis. Because the state's residency requirement was rationally related to the state's interest, the parties were required to meet the one-year residency requirement before petitioning for divorce.</SPAN></P>

The State claimed that appellees used printed form leases allegedly in violation of the Law, and that the printing companies illegally printed and sold the form leases. The reviewing court held that the Law covered allegedly unfair or deceptive practices in connection with the leasing of housing. However, that portion of the order dismissing the state's complaint for failure to state a cause of action with respect to the use of &quot;unenforceable&quot; lease provisions was affirmed. For reasons different than those advanced by the lower court, that portion of its order dismissing the complaint with respect to the printing companies was also affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant heirs challenged the trial court decision which held that decedent's residuary estate should be distributed to the five charitable institutions named in decedent's will. Appellants argued that the gifts, which were made 24 days prior to decedent's death should be invalidated pursuant to 20 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 2507 (1). The court held that the statute violated the Equal Protection of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it impermissibly divided testators into two classes, one whose wills provided for charitable gifts and who died within 30 days of executing their wills. The other was composed of testators who either made no charitable gifts or survived the execution of their wills by at least 30 days. The statute rendered invalid any charitable gifts made by a testator in the first class if any person &quot;who would benefit by its invalidity&quot; objected. Clearly, the statutory classification bore only the most tenuous relation to the legislative purpose of protecting the decedent's family, and also sought to nullify bequests to charity even where the testator left no immediate family. The court affirmed the trial court's decree.</SPAN></P>

The lower court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court held that a court of equity was not always required to entertain a constitutional attack on a taxing statute without regard for the adequacy of the legislatively prescribed remedy. The court determined that the more direct the attack on a statute, the more likely it was that the exercise of equitable jurisdiction would not damage the role of the administrative agency, nor require the factual fabric which might develop at the agency level. The court concluded that the specialized proceedings would be of little use in determining the constitutionality of the statute and that whatever benefit could be derived from the filing of individual appeals would be far outweighed by the inconvenience, delay, and expense involved. The court held that the statutory remedy was not adequate and that there was a substantial question of constitutionality going directly to the validity of the assessment scheme.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of a decision of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held that out-of-state property owned by appellee realty corporation should be excluded from the valuation of appellee's capital stock for purposes of the Pennsylvania franchise tax, 72 P. S. &sect; 1871(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth challenged a decision of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held that out-of-state property owned by appellee realty corporation, should be excluded from the valuation of appellee's capital stock for purposes of the Pennsylvania franchise tax, 72 P. S. &sect; 1871(b). Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in excluding the New York assets and receipts because appellee had not met its burden of proof that inclusion would create an unconstitutional application of the tax; and that the valuation based on the book value of the properties was incorrect. The facts showed that the only connection between the Pennsylvania properties and the out-of-state enterprises was common ownership. Thus, appellee amply met its burden in establishing that it was a multiform business whose out-of state assets were unrelated to and completely independent of its Pennsylvania franchise. The Commonwealth made no attempt to offer specific evidence of the &quot;other values&quot; such as value for tax purposes and appraisal value, so the book value absent such other evidence was an appropriate measure of the franchise's value. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania House of Representatives adopted a House Resolution which established a special committee to investigate matters pertaining to law enforcement. Petitioner, a lieutenant of the state police, was summoned to testify before the committee concerning alleged wiretapping activities by the state police. On the advice of counsel, petitioner refused to answer certain questions despite being requested several times on separate occasions to do so. The House of Representatives then adopted a resolution which found petitioner in contempt of the House and authorized the issuance of a warrant for his commitment. Petitioner filed his application for writ of habeas corpus in the trial court and the application was dismissed. Petitioner challenged that ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the power of all Houses of the General Assembly to vindicate their authority and processes by punishing acts of contempt committed in their presence was inherent in the legislative function. The House had the power under 46 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 61 to commit to prison any person who refused to answer legal questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), that granted petitions of appellee county board of elections for the consolidation and realignment of various election districts, on the ground that the notice provisions of Pa. Code &sect; 504, 25 Pa. Stat. &sect; 2704, were not complied with.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the petitions of appellee county board of elections for the consolidation and realignment of various election districts. Appeals were taken to the Commonwealth Court, but were then transferred to the appellate court pursuant to 17 Pa. Stat. &sect; 211.503(b), since they involved the right to public office. Appellant argued for reversal of the orders of the court on the ground that the notice provisions of the Election Code, Pa. Code &sect; 504, 25 P.S. &sect; 2704, were not complied with. Notices of the proposed consolidations were posted on February 27, 1964, the petitions were filed on March 4, a hearing was begun on March 8, and the final orders consolidating the election districts were entered on March 11, 1974. The appellate court reversed the order. The court determined that the court was without power to set a hearing date or to entertain objections to the consolidation prior to filing a petition. The court ruled that the actions of the trial court were not in compliance with &sect; 504 because the court considered the petitions only four days after filing and the final orders were entered only seven days after filing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and held that the actions of the trial court in setting a hearing to entertain objections to the consolidation proposal only four days after filing was in contravention of the Election Code. The court ruled that the limitations on the court's power created by the code were jurisdictional requirements that could not be waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review after they were suspended from the practice of law arguing that their constitutional rights were violated when they were required during cross examination to admit that they had claimed the privilege against self-incrimination in the preliminary proceedings. The court reversed, concluding that it was a violation of appellants' rights pursuant to U. S. Const. amend. V and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 to admit the evidence. The court found that appellants' credibility was impeached and possibly severely impaired by the unconstitutional references to their prior claims of the privilege, and that this was an improper penalty imposed for exercising a constitutional privilege. The court stated that a prior statement could have been used to impeach the credibility of a witness, but only if the prior statement was inconsistent with the testimony of the witness at trial. In this instance, the court reasoned that asserting the privilege against self-incrimination was not inconsistent with testimony of innocence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that appellants' contentions that there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to sustain the findings of guilt and that the investigative procedures violated appellants' constitutional rights were without merit. Further, the court found that the evidence establishing a pattern of improper solicitation was clear and convincing. The court held that the lower court was fully justified in finding that appellants had abused their positions as lawyers and as officers of the court, and that appellants' breaches of the code of professional responsibility were serious in nature, and that imposition of discipline was required.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed finding that &sect; 624.1(c) created a presumption, but that it could be rebutted by a defendant. Further, the court found that the trier of fact could find that the presumption was not applicable in a particular case, as well. Given that a blood alcohol level as defined in the statute did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant was guilty, the court found that the statute was not unconstitutional. Appellants argued that they were also denied their right to cross examine the experts that determined the blood alcohol level at which intoxication normally occurred. The court found that the legislature could incorporate findings of fact into statutory inferences without infringing on a defendant's right of confrontation because a defendant was entitled to call his own experts at trial to rebut the presumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his sentence of punishment of 10 to 20 years imprisonment for his conviction of murder in the second degree entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County (Pennsylvania). Appellant's sole challenge was with regard to the constitutionality of the Muncy Act, 61 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a male offender, was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 10 to 20 years of imprisonment. Appellant challenged his sentence, claiming that the Act of 1911, 19 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1051-1057 (1964) and the new Muncy Act, 61 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 566 (1974) by their joint operation were constitutionally impermissible. The court affirmed appellant's sentence, but held that the new Muncy Act, 61 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 566 was unconstitutional because it required trial courts not to fix a minimum sentence when imposing sentence on a woman. The court held that the idea that one person was eligible for parole at a different time than another person solely because of his or her sex was discrimination of the most obvious sort under Pa. Cons. art. I, &sect; 28 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. As such, the court struck the last sentence of &sect; 566, which prohibited minimum sentences for female offenders. However, the court found that the Act of 1911, under which appellant was sentenced, was completely neutral and expressed a legislative judgment concerning sentencing alternatives that applied to any person regardless of sex.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence of 10 to 20 years imprisonment for his conviction of second degree murder because the general sentencing statute under which appellant was sentenced was completely neutral on its face.

Appellant claimed error in the trial court's refusal to charge on identification, entrapment, and argued that the facts did not support a verdict for both convictions. She also alleged error in the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried by a jury and convicted of prostitution and solicitation to commit sodomy. A sentence of fifteen months imprisonment and a $ 500 fine was imposed by the trial court. The lower court affirmed without an opinion in a per curiam order. Appellant alleged that the trial court erroneously refused to charge the jury on both identification and entrapment. She also claimed that the facts did not prove both prostitution and solicitation to commit sodomy. Further, appellant maintained that her conduct did not fall within the statutory definition of solicitation to commit sodomy. As to her sentence, appellant claimed that the failure to set a minimum limit on her sentence denied her equal protection of the laws and, that her sentence was excessive. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence because appellant failed to specifically take exception to the jury charge and waived the additional issues because she failed to raise them in the trial court or the lower court and could not raise them for the first time on appeal to the court. Finally, the court found that the trial court's sentence was not so excessive as to be constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence because appellant had failed to preserve any of her issues for review by the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered the rear fire tower of a hospital after the end of visiting hours. In response to a call by a nurse who heard noise in the tower, the police proceeded to the area and arrested appellant. Appellant was convicted of loitering and prowling under 18 Pa. Stat. 4418. Appellant contended that his activity did not come within the coverage of the statute and the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Appellant argued that the statute did not cover indoor prowling and loitering and relied on the principle of strict construction of penal statutes. The appellate court affirmed and held that the statute was designed to alleviate the danger to human life and quiet enjoyment of one's dwelling, which was presented by the nighttime loitering or prowling of malicious-minded individuals and the danger was intensified when the proscribed activity occurred inside, rather than outside, the dwelling. The court found that the statute gave adequate warning to potential offenders and was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Cross-petitions for allocatur were filed, prosecution requesting to have the conviction for anonymous publication reinstated, and appellant seeking reversal of his convictions for criminal libel. The court reversed the lower court's affirmation of the criminal libel convictions because the lower court erroneously concluded that a previous decision by only five members of the court was not binding. The court noted that when a majority of the justices participating join in an opinion, the opinion became binding precedent on the courts of the state.

Appellant was apprehended after one of the missing checks had been cashed. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that they could infer appellant's guilt from his recent possession of the stolen goods by itself. The court noted that the term &quot;recent possession&quot; was undergoing a redefinition in light of present-day experience, and found that it had become a term of art dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of each case. Therefore, the court found that the utility of &quot;recent possession&quot; as a standardized inference was seriously in doubt, although the court did not specifically rule that it no longer existed. The court held that in this case use of the inference segregated appellant's possession of the stolen checks from the other evidence of his guilt but it was not sufficient on its own to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as there was no proof of the time of the theft. The court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Crim. 1118(b) precluded a sua sponte declaration of mistrial by the trial judge. Following appellant's first trial, a new trial was ordered, because the trial court had not granted his motion for withdrawal of a juror when the trial court became aware that the father of the victim was a juror. At the second trial, the trial judge learned that the victim's father was employed as a tipstaff and was attending the jurors. Appellant's counsel, when told, declined to file a motion, but the trial court declared a mistrial. Appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that a retrial would constitute double jeopardy. The trial court denied the petition, and appellant sought review. The court determined that Rule 1118 abolished a motion to withdraw a juror, but did not change the sua sponte declaration of mistrial by the trial court. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the trial court had the authority to abort a trial when in its sound discretion it found that either manifest necessity or the ends of public justice required the declaration of a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's petition for allowance to appeal from the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the trial court's order that sustained defendant's demurrer based on its determination that 18 P.S. &sect; 6108 (1973) proscribed only the carrying of rifles with barrels measuring less than 15 inches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the lower court's judgment affirming the trial court's determination that 18 P.S. &sect; 6108 (1973) proscribed only the carrying of rifles with barrels measuring less than 15 inches. The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and held that as evidenced by its explicit language, the clear intent of &sect; 6108, which was the 1968 amendment to 18 P.S. &sect; 6102 (1973), was that in described circumstances the carrying of any firearm, shotgun, or rifle, constituted a criminal act. The court stated that the trial court's reading of the statute was too narrow and impermissibly rendered the words &quot;rifle&quot; and &quot;shotgun&quot; in the 1968 amendment superfluous, and that its holding that the unlicensed carrying of a rifle with a 22-inch barrel was not a crime was error. The court held that the indictment notified defendant of the charge against him, and that the common-sense meaning of those words was that he was accused of illegally carrying a weapon, a rifle. The court further held that the state's proof was consistent with the common sense reading of the language of the indictment and that the defense was clearly directed to the alleged conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders of the lower court. The court held that defendant was adequately notified that he was indicted for the criminal act of carrying a weapon, a rifle, and that his defense was clearly directed to such conduct, not to some different offense at a different time or place. The court also concluded that defendant was not misled by the indictment, and that the record did not substantiate a claim of prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The court found appellants failed to prove the arbitrariness of the certification because they provided only the unsupported testimony of one witness who was not familiar with all the conditions which are statutorily required to be used to determine the existence of blight. It also held the balance of appellants' contentions could not be raised by preliminary injunction because the scope of preliminary injunctions in this circumstance was limited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer produced custom-made portraits. Appellant took photos in appellee commonwealth, but all processing of the photos took place in another state.

The lower court dismissed the appeal brought by appellant regarding the use tax assessed. On appeal, the court agreed that the making of a custom-made portrait constituted manufacturing within 72 P.S. &sect; 3403-2(c) and that the cameras and film were used in one of the operations of the manufacture of personal property which was excluded from the use tax by 72 P.S. &sect; 3403-2(n)(4)(c). The court held that the statute was clear that the cameras and film were excluded from use tax, and there was no basis for the lower court's finding that appellant could still be taxed because the other steps in the manufacturing process took place outside of the commonwealth.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent died intestate in the Soviet Union, and his estate's only asset was a pension fund in Pennsylvania.

Appellant purported heirs then filed a petition to set aside the final distribution, which the trial court dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that foreign heirs were subject to the same burden of proof of kinship as American claimants, which was proof both that heirs at law existed and that claimants were those heirs at law. The court held that the power of attorney signed by appellants, which was the only evidence offered, was a mere assertion of kinship, not proof.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">29&nbsp;Although the appellant-districts have not raised the issue, we observe that there is some question whether it can be said that the second precondition to the validity of a Legislative rule -- &quot;issued pursuant to proper procedure&quot;, see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Davis, supra,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> at 299 -- is fairly met here.  The Commission's definition of a segregated school, notwithstanding its having been labeled a &quot;finding of fact&quot; in the final orders issued by the Commission, is clearly a substantive rule of law; we have so regarded it in this opinion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Prior to the effective date of the new Commonwealth Documents Law, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 769, No. 240, 45 P.S. &sect; 1101 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> (Supp. 1973-74), the rules and regulations of the Commission were required by section 21 of the Administrative Agency Law, Act of June 4, 1945, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">as amended,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">&nbsp;71 P.S. &sect; 1710.21, to be placed on file with the Department of State for the examination of interested citizens.  The Commission's definition of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> segregation does not appear to have been published as a rule or regulation; certainly it was not among those existing rules and regulations brought over into the Pennsylvania Code under the Commonwealth Documents Law.  Under that new Law, an agency preparing to adopt a rule must give public notice of its intention, 45 P.S. &sect; 1201, must &quot;review and consider any written comments submitted&quot;, 45 P.S. &sect; 1202, and &quot;may hold such public hearings as seem appropriate&quot;.  Although 45 P.S. &sect; 1204 does exempt certain types of regulations from this process, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">legislative</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> (as contrasted with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">interpretative</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">) rules are not excepted. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c13">In exercising a power legislative in nature, we think it necessary to comply fully with legislatively-prescribed procedures.  See L. L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 566 (1965).

The lower court affirmed the finding and appellants sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court first noted that appellee was empowered to correct de facto segregation occurring in state public schools and that the Act itself did not provide a definition for racial imbalance. Appellee had the power to adopt its definition of racial imbalance. The court considered definitions used in other contexts, including federal law, state law, and other authorities, and concluded that appellee's definition was without support in the materials examined. However, the Act empowered appellee to supply the definition because appellee was permitted to do more than merely interpret the Act. Thus, the definition was within appellee's authority and was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, injured wife and her father, brought an action against appellee husband for damages arising from an automobile accident in which appellee was the driver of the automobile. At the time of the accident, appellant injured wife and appellee were not married. The appellate court affirmed the order from the trial court sustaining appellee's preliminary objections. The lower court found that appellant injured wife lacked the capacity to sue him because she was appellee's wife, and accordingly, the complaint was dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed the order from the appellate court. The court found that appellant injured wife could not sue appellee because appellee was protected by interspousal immunity pursuant to 48 P.S. &sect; 111. The court determined that an unliquidated tort claim was not &quot;separate property&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 111, and appellee was therefore protected by interspousal immunity. The court determined that &quot;separate property&quot; as defined in &sect; 111 was lesser in scope than an all-encompassing definition of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was found guilty of speeding and ordered to pay a fine. The prosecution appealed an order from the appellate court granting appellee's motion to quash the summary conviction and ruling Pa. Stat.

The court explained the constitutionality of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 618(b)(2) was not a justiciable issue before the court because appellee had not been affected by the operation of this statute, which dealt with the suspension of an operator's license. As for Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 1002(b)(8), the court determined that it was a conferring of power on the Secretary of Highways in connection with the execution of the speed limit law. This grant of authority was valid because it guided and restrained the exercise of the administrative functions delegated to the secretary. The legislature was attempting to promote safety on the highways, and it provided guidance on what it believed to be safe speeds in certain areas. The statute also mandated the secretary to give notice of the allowable speed increase.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that on its face the law was constitutional, because the retroactive effect of the tax covered a period of one month, which was within the bounds of Pennsylvania constitutional law and that the tax was constitutional as applied. Appellant did not sustain the burden of overcoming the presumption of the validity of tax legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After having been detained and interrogated for 24 hours, appellant, a 19-year-old with no prior police contact, confessed to his complicity in seven burglaries. Immediately thereafter, he was preliminarily arraigned. On grant of allocatur, appellant challenged the decision of superior court, which affirmed the decision of the trial court, which convicted him of a second degree burglary charge, denied his post-trial motions, and convicted him of five other burglary charges following his guilty pleas. On appeal, the court reversed and granted a new trial, holding that appellant had not waived error in the admission of his confession, although it was not included in his motion to suppress, because it was based on a subsequently announced legal principle. The court held that the unjustified 24-hour delay between appellant's arrest and arraignment was unnecessary and thus violated Pa. R. Crim. P. 116(a) (1965). His confession was reasonably related to the delay, invalid, and inadmissible. The court remanded for post-trial motions and a hearing as to whether appellant's guilty pleas to the six remaining burglary charges were primarily motivated by the illegally obtained confession.</SPAN></P>

Appellant then brought an action in mandamus and, while appellant's action was pending, the court issued an opinion which would have required that appellant's claim be brought as a declaratory judgment action. Therefore, in the interests of fairness, the court treated appellant's action as if it were a declaratory judgment action.

The court assumed plenary jurisdiction and found the Act constitutional. The Act served a public purpose because it administered housing programs for persons in need. The Act did not delegate legislative power because the agency involved was a governmental entity and the Act's guidelines did not permit broad or unusual discretion. The Act did not authorize a debt or pledge of credit by Pennsylvania because by its own terms, bonds and notes issued under its auspices were not deemed debts or pledges. The Act did not constitute an irrevocable grant of special privileges and immunities because the challenged provision was simply an amplification of the prohibition against the impairment of contracts. The Act did not provide for a prohibited exemption from taxation because bonds issued under the Act were not the sort of property contemplated by the prohibition against exemption. The Act did not create a special or local law because it had no geographical distinction and was intended to apply statewide. The Act's title was proper as it gave adequate notice as to its subject.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city enacted an ordinance which provided for the imposition of a head tax on all passengers arriving or departing from appellee's airports and required appellant airlines to be liable for the tax.

Subsequently appellee enacted an ordinance which imposed a head tax on certain passengers departing from the airport and required appellants to collect the tax with the price of the ticket.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parking lot operators filed a complaint in equity that challenged appellee city's gross receipts parking tax ordinance. Appellants asserted that the ordinance was so excessive and unreasonable that it amounted to a confiscation of appellants' property without due process of law because appellee was in direct economic competition with appellants.

XIV in that appellee had no reasonable basis for separately classifying appellants' commercial parking operations for the purpose of taxation. The court reversed the dismissal of appellants' complaint.

Appellants filed a complaint in mandamus seeking an order declaring that they were rightful holders of positions as assistant district attorneys and requiring appellee to compensate them. The trial court dismissed appellants' complaint, and the court affirmed. The court concluded that appellants were city employees and were subject to &sect; 10-107(5). The court held that the prohibition on political candidacy was a constitutionally permissible restriction on the political activity of city employees. The court concluded that the city had a compelling governmental interest eliminating neglect of official duties and undue influence and intimidation of employees under a candidate's supervision that justified requiring city employees to resign before becoming.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed, subject to modification of the sentence to life imprisonment. The trial court had jurisdiction because the victim's death occurred and a number of wounds were inflicted within the city. The trial judge did not err in failing to instruct the jury on jurisdiction because the facts overwhelmingly supported jurisdiction. The trial court's refusal to challenge a prospective juror for cause was proper where the juror's reservation about serving was based upon schedule conflicts. The Commonwealth's summation statement that all of its evidence was taken &quot;without a word from the defendant&quot; was not grounds for reversal. Defendant was not coerced into deciding not to take the stand because there was no constitutional violation in impeachment by prior convictions. Finally, as the imposition of the death penalty under statutes such as the one in which the death penalty was imposed upon defendant was violative of U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV, it was unnecessary to consider defendant's claim of non-compliance with the Witherspoon standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant unions sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee trade association a preliminary injunction and issued contempt citations against appellants for violation of a no-strike clause in a collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee trade association sought an injunction against appellant unions for violation of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The trial court granted the injunctions and held appellants in contempt for failure to comply. On appeal, the court held that appellee's unsuccessful attempt for relief in federal court was not res judicata because a final determination as to the contract's existence was not made. The trial court erred in finding that a valid CBA existed because the contract was not ratified. Although the preliminary injunction was invalid, the legality of the contempt citations was still to be determined. Two of the contempt citations issued for failure to work were in error as there was insufficient evidence to hold appellants in contempt as a consequence of the walkouts, under 43 P.S. &sect; 206h. The trial court erred in holding certain appellants in contempt because they were not parties to the original action. The trial court did not err in issuing a decree that appellants' refusal to cross an outside union's picket lines was not grounds for contempt, conditioned on appellants' promise of future compliance. Thus, the court affirmed in part, and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part because the injunction against appellant unions was invalid as the collective bargaining agreement had not been ratified and some of the contempt citations were improper because appellants could not be held responsible for their members' actions under the circumstances. The trial court's decree as to appellant's refusal to cross an outside picket line was proper, where the decree did not hold appellants in contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician brought a suit to enjoin appellee hospital from denying him the right to perform certain procedures in appellee's laboratory. After trial, the chancellor denied the requested relief. A court en banc dismissed appellant's exceptions and entered a final decree. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellee's policy of permitting only its full-time laboratory director to perform certain procedures was reasonable and did not violate due process. No patient rights were infringed because there was no right that would permit a patient to insist on his own doctor's performance of the procedures conducted in a laboratory equipped and staffed by appellee. Appellant was not denied equal protection of the law because appellee's policies for the laboratory reasonably treated cardiologists, such as appellant, and surgeons differently. Appellant was not entitled to a hearing under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because his claim of denial of procedural due process was based on nothing more than a unilateral expectation. Similarly, appellant was not entitled to a hearing under appellee's by-laws because exclusion from the laboratory was not a triggering event for a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because appellee hospital's refusal to permit appellant physician from performing certain procedures in appellee's laboratory did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription against equal protection or due process where the policy was reasonable and appellant was not due a hearing based upon his unilateral expectation. Appellant also was not entitled to a hearing pursuant to appellee's by-laws based on the facts.</SPAN></P>

Appellee newspaper, a corporation, was not an &quot;adult resident&quot; and appellee editor was acting on its behalf. Appellees did not assert any non-commercial or non-political use, as required by the statute, and its provision of the telephone book failed to satisfy the requirement regarding the production of the recipients' names. The information was subject to an exception of the Right to Know Act, 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 66.1 et seq., that barred access to public records where the publication was prohibited, restricted or forbidden by statute. Access to the information was not compelled by either U.S. Const. amend. I or Pa. Const. art.

The court noted that the bylaws of appellee contained safeguards against the creation of an impermissible conflict of interest.The fact that the mayor appointed members of the board did not give the city control of appellee because it was unlikely that appellee's directors would accept nominees for seats on the board that would act as a rubber stamp for the mayor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, voluntary manslaughter, and two counts of robbery, and was sentenced to death on the murder conviction, and from 10 to 20 years on the robbery convictions. Defendant appealed the post-verdict court's denial of his motion for a new trial based on the state's repeated emphasis on &quot;uncontroverted&quot; evidence, which highlighted his failure to testify. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of sentence and ordered a new trial, because the state's emphasis on defendant's failure to testify violated defendant's right not to testify under U.S. Const. amend. V and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The state's comments implied that defendant himself was the only one who could and should have denied the charges against him, and the jury might reasonably have inferred from these statements that his failure to do so was evidence of his guilt. The court held that the use of the word &quot;uncontroverted&quot; in the prosecutor's closing argument also was error, because defendant was not required to affirmatively deny any allegation at all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions and granted a new trial because the state's emphasis on defendant's failure to testify and its use of the term &quot;uncontroverted&quot; evidence were harmful constitutional error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, two appellants challenged the judgments of the lower courts (Pennsylvania), which revoked their probation prior to the trial for the criminal charges that were based on the same activities that gave rise to the alleged probation violation. One appellant sought a writ of prohibition to postpone a probation revocation hearing until after a trial on the substantial criminal charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, two appellants challenged judgments revoking their probation following arrests, but prior to trial on the charges, and one appellant sought a writ of prohibition to require that the revocation hearing be postponed until trial of the charges. The court affirmed the judgments and denied the writ, holding held that there were no statutory or constitutional prohibitions against conducting the hearings prior to the trial. Because the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the probation had been an effective vehicle to accomplish rehabilitation and a sufficient deterrent against future antisocial conduct, a prompt hearing was necessary and evidentiary standards were relaxed. Due process required a revocation hearing, but the exclusionary rule was inapplicable. The court held, as to the instant cases, a statement by one appellant was admissible and because it was not raised during the hearing, a claim that the statement was coerced was barred. In the other appellant's hearing, it was not required that the victim appear in court where there was eyewitness testimony of an assault.</SPAN></P>

Defendant subsequently filed a direct appeal. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of sentence and ordered a new trial. The court ruled defendant was entitled to a new trial since he was unable to effectively and meaningfully exercise his direct appeal rights because he had not been furnished a full transcript or other equivalent picture of what transpired during his trial. The court found that, following a conviction of murder in the first degree, it was the duty of the official stenographer to make, certify, and file of record a typewritten copy of the stenographic notes of trial. In defendant's case, trial counsel made repeated requests but never received a full transcript because substantial and pertinent portions of the notes of testimony were never transcribed due to the stenographer's death. The court found that defendant was entitled to a new trial because specific prejudice or harm would have resulted from not having the entire transcript of testimony as meaningful appellate review was impossible without a complete transcript.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the double jeopardy clause required a prosecutor to bring, in a single proceeding, all known charges against a defendant arising from a &quot;single criminal episode.&quot; First, the court determined that all charges brought in the two successive prosecutions against each defendant originated from but one criminal episode. Because the record established but a single criminal episode for each defendant, the court held that all charges brought against defendants should have been consolidated in single proceedings.

Defendant was questioned at various times throughout the day and eventually confessed after more than 17 hours since the Miranda warnings had passed and defendant had not had any sleep. The court reversed the trial court and held that the confession of defendant was not voluntary. The court also held that the police were constitutionally required to re-advise defendant of his rights under U.S. Const. amends. V and VI prior to the oral confession.

The Commonwealth also sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (Pennsylvania), which granted defendant mechanic's motion for postconviction relief after he pleaded guilty to violating &sect; 718 of the anti-abortion law, 18 P.S. &sect; 4718.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mechanic pleaded guilty to violating &sect; 718 of the anti-abortion statute,&nbsp;18 P.S. &sect; 4718, but later filed a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. The commonwealth appealed the order that granted defendant's motion because &sect; 718 was unconstitutional. Defendant doctor was prosecuted and convicted for violating &sect; 719 of the anti-abortion statute,&nbsp;18 P.S. &sect; 4719, and he appealed the judgment. The court, upon consolidating the two cases for review, reversed the convictions of both defendants. The court held that &sect; 718 and &sect; 719 were unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the provisions failed to comply with the permissible scope of state regulation of abortion. The court determined that as the provisions were unconstitutional, the prosecutions of defendants based on these sections could not sustain their convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sought a writ of prohibition against the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) from the enforcement of Rule &lt;*&gt;301 of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, which prohibited petitioner from entering appearances on behalf of criminal clients because he had an excessive number of cases pending trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ to prohibit the court from invoking against him a rule which prohibited the entry of appearance on behalf of criminal clients where an attorney had a certain number of criminal cases pending trial within a given amount of time. The court granted the writ. The court first stated that in the interest of judicial economy it would consider the challenge to the rule on the basis that it restricted the rights of criminal defendants to counsel of their choice, even though petitioner's standing to assert this argument was questionable. The court held that the rule was a reasonable infringement on the defendant's rights and the right of attorneys to practice criminal law given the backlog of cases and the state's duty to provide speedy trials and expeditiously dispose of criminal cases. However, while the rule permitted disputes as to the accuracy of the list of pending cases, there was no procedure to challenge the reason for delay, such as the prosecution's failure to be prepared or the failure of witnesses to appear. Because of the lack of standards, the rule was held to be vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the lower appellate court and affirmed the Board's orders.

Appellant's assessment did not allow such a deduction. The lower court rejected appellant's tax assessment and held that the inheritance tax on the specifically devised realty was deductible before valuing the residue for tax purposes. The court reversed the lower court's decree that rejected appellant's tax assessment because the trial court erred in allowing the tax on the specific devise to be deducted for the purpose of computing the total inheritance tax due.

As to the murder conviction and subsequent sentence, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the 32 month delay until the trial. The court concluded that defendant's right to a speedy trial were not violated because the case was removed from the trial list in one instance for purpose of plea negotiations and in another for reasons not discernable from the record. The court determined that defendant failed to raise the claim until the day of the actual trial and defendant did not object to the continuances granted to the state.

The court ruled that evidentiary errors did not entitle defendant to relief because they did not rise to the level of constitutional error. It held that any illegality in the search complained of by defendant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was not prejudiced by being denied a juvenile certification hearing, and that the admission of testimony of his silence in response to certain statements did not raise a constitutional issue because it did not occur in the context of a custodial interrogation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, which reversed the family court order that had dismissed petitioner director's application for appointment of a guardian for respondent's 16-year-old son on grounds that he was a neglected child under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 243 et seq. because respondent refused, for religious reasons, to consent to spinal surgery to treat the child's paralytic scoliosis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother had a son who suffered from paralytic scoliosis, which prevented him from standing or walking. Respondent refused to give consent to the physician-advised surgery on the grounds that the proposed spinal fusion procedure required her son to receive blood transfusions, to which respondent was religiously opposed. Consequently, petitioner director sought a declaration that the boy was a neglected child under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 243 et seq., which required the appointment of a guardian who would give consent to the operation. The trial court dismissed the petition, but the superior court reversed. On review, the court reversed, noting that there was no evidence that the boy's life was in any danger that required immediate surgery. The court accordingly found that state's parens patriae interest was not sufficient to outweigh respondent's religious beliefs and rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. However, the court remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to allow the boy an opportunity to be heard, noting that the ultimate question was whether respondent's religious beliefs were paramount to the possible adverse wishes of her son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to determine the child's wishes, finding that because the teenager's life was not immediately imperiled by his physical condition, the state's parens patriae interest was not, in itself, of sufficient magnitude to outweigh respondent mother's religious beliefs, although the child's personal decision might be paramount to respondent's beliefs.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the conviction claiming error in denial of the motion to suppress and that there were multiple errors within the trial. The court found that the motion to suppress was properly denied as the commonwealth met its burden, the trial court did make findings of fact, and consonant statement was inadmissible to corroborate appellant's testimony regarding police misconduct. Additionally, the court found that the petition for mistrial was properly denied as hearsay statement had no influence on the verdict, appellant's confession although read into the record was an exhibit, under Pa. R. Crim. P. 323(g) it was permissible to allow appellant's statements from suppression hearing in where at trial he testified contrary, and that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of hearing for continuance based on allegations of unfair trial due to pre-trial publicity of an unrelated gang member.</SPAN></P>

The commonwealth sought judicial review of that plan. The court found that the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, required that the commonwealth make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as practicable but allow for divergences from a strict population standard based on state policy. The court also found that the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 required the Commonwealth to be divided into 50 senatorial and 203 representative districts, which would be composed of compact and contiguous territory as nearly equal in population as practicable. Further, unless absolutely necessary no county, city, incorporated town, borough, township or ward would be divided in forming either a senatorial or representative district. The court affirmed the final apportionment plan of the Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission, finding that the plan comported with the mandates of the Federal and Pennsylvania Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Evidence indicated that four men participated in the attack; one of the four alleged assailants identified appellant and a second man as responsible. During investigation by appellee state, a warrant was obtained to search appellant's residence. The search yielded bloodstained clothing matching the victim's blood. The jury selected for the trial was drawn from a 98 percent white pool; the county wherein the crime was committed had a 6-8 percent black population. During trial, the judge examined one of appellant's alibi witnesses whom he believed to be lying, and looked up at the witness from the bench. Appellant's post-trial motions for relief were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the victim's wounds gave authorities probable cause to suspect that the clothing worn by appellant would be covered with blood; that appellant missed the deadline to challenge the grand jury array; and that an alleged grimace of the trial judge while examining appellant's alibi witness did not warrant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the Board of School Directors and the superintendent of schools, developed a plan for quality desegregated education for the city school district designed to correct a racial imbalance in the district. Appellant taxpayer brought an action in equity for declaratory relief and injunction to prevent appellee from implementing the plan. The trial court denied appellant's request for a preliminary injunction and sustained a demurrer to appellant's complaint. Appellant sought review, arguing that the complaint did set forth a cause of action upon which relief could have been granted. Specifically, appellant argued that the adoption of the plan was not the result of properly exercised discretion, and the plan violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and, therefore, the expenditure of tax monies was illegal and could be enjoined. The court disagreed, finding that the plan was not adopted by the board under duress but rather was the product of board discretion. The court also found that the plan was constitutional and was carefully crafted to make the assignment of pupils and busing fair and equitable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony from the detective who purchased allegedly obscene books from appellants and the books themselves were commonwealth's only evidence as to the question of obscenity vel non. Appellants were convicted of illegal possession and sale of obscene literature in violation of the Pennsylvania Obscenity Statute, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4524. The superior court affirmed the convictions and sentences. On appeal, the court reversed because commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of proof. Because it was not hard core pornography, proof other than the books was required to establish that the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appealed to a prurient interest in sex, that the material was patently offensive, and that the material was utterly without redeeming social value. Determination of obscenity was for the trial court on the basis of contemporary community standards.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of the dismissal order. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the indigent defendants had a full, complete, and adequate remedy at law. Therefore, appellant's complaint was not cognizable in equity. The court reasoned that such indigent defendants could raise the issue at trial and could fully pursue their constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of two indicted appellants was unavailable for trial. During the trial, the trial court on its own motion declared a mistrial over appellant's objections. Both appellants were retried on the same indictments and both were convicted of burglary, larceny, receiving stolen goods, and conspiracy. The superior court affirmed both judgments of sentence. On appeal, the court reversed as to the available appellant because the convictions at the second trial constituted double jeopardy. There was no manifest necessity for the mistrial and the trial court abused its discretion in directing one because appellant's desire to proceed should have been respected. The court affirmed the judgment as to the unavailable appellant because there was no question of double jeopardy. All of the occupants of the vehicle in which appellant was riding acted in concert and the act of throwing property out of the window sufficiently warranted the conclusion that appellant exercised control over the property. The facts supported a connection between appellant's unexplained possession of recently stolen property and an inference that appellant had stolen the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borough denied appellee company a permit to erect a service station in a commercial district. Appellee challenged the denial to the zoning board, claiming the ordinance prohibiting service stations in commercial districts was unconstitutional. The zoning board affirmed the denial, and the common pleas court affirmed that decision. The reviewing court, however, reversed the denial, and appellant challenged. The court refused to abandon the policy that a zoning ordinance was presumed valid and that the burden of establishing its invalidity was upon the party challenging it. However, the requirement that an applicant establish by affirmative evidence the nonexistence of a proper zoning purpose in the total prohibition of an otherwise legitimate business activity was an unrealistic burden. Thus, the court held that appellee met its burden by showing the total ban. Appellant then had the burden of sustaining the ordinance by presenting evidence which established the public purpose served thereby.

The dispute was not one of public concern and did not contribute to debate on public issues.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant, a resident of the Soviet Union, contended that he was the testator's son and residuary legatee.

Some years after an initial dismissal of his exceptions, appellant petitioned for release of the funds. The trial court acknowledged the Iron Curtain Act was unconstitutional, but nonetheless denied appellant's petition on grounds that he had failed to supply clear, precise, and definite proof of his identity. It was ordered the funds remain in the state treasury pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1314. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Because this was not a case of intestacy, the court held appellant had to establish his identity only by a preponderance of competent evidence. Appellant's evidence included a certificate of acknowledgement executed by the United States Consul in Moscow, as well as affidavits from residents of the village from which the testator had emigrated.

After an evidentiary hearing, appellant's petition was denied. On appeal, the court found that neither appellant nor his counsel challenged the admissibility of his confession at trial. Moreover, the court held that appellant admitted that the primary motivation for his guilty plea was the advice of his counsel that he plead guilty to avoid the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant savings and loan members sought review of the decision to dismiss their complaint. The principal issue presented by appeal was whether a member of a saving and loan association had a right, enforceable in a court of equity, to compel a membership vote on a proposed merger of his association with another as a pre-condition to the merger. The complaint alleged that appellee association's directors refused to notify the members of their association concerning the proposed merger, or to furnish appellants with a membership list so that they could communicate with them. Appellants argued that important property rights of members were involved, and that as a matter of fundamental fairness and in the exercise of its supervisory control over corporations, a court of equity should have intervened to protect those rights by allowing a membership vote. The court held that appellants failed to demonstrate that such property rights as they may have were in danger of being adversely affect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged a decree of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), dismissing complaints in equity that challenged the constitutionality of the Personal Income Tax enacted by Article III of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. &sect; 7101 et seq. Appellants contended that the tax offended the constitutional mandate of uniformity set forth in Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers argued that the personal income tax enacted under Article III of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. &sect; 7101 et seq., was repugnant to the Pennsylvania Constitution. On appeal from a decree dismissing appellants' complaints in equity, the court held that the structure of the personal income tax failed to conform to the requirements of the Uniformity Clause set forth in Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 which required all taxes be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. In explaining its holding, the court concluded that although the income tax imposed a flat rate of tax upon taxable income, the concept of taxable income reflected a myriad of tax preferences which created an unequal burden upon persons enjoying identical privileges of receiving earnings or otherwise acquiring the same dollar amount of annual income from any source whatsoever. Accordingly, the court held that the pervasive and impermissible discriminations between similarly situated taxpayers rendered the tax invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the principle that, when an appellate court was equally divided, the judgment, order or decree of the court below would be affirmed.

The trial court issued a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo during the pendency of the action and appellant sought review. The court reversed the order granting the injunction, finding no reasonable ground for the issuance of the order. The court determined that appellees failed to establish a constitutional right to retention of their jobs and absent such a right their claim of protection under procedural due process of a right to notice and a hearing was without merit. The court found that appellees were also not able to establish any statutory right to retention of their jobs. The court concluded that appellees, who obtained their jobs through political patronage, were essentially employees-at-will with no right to due process before their discharge.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the suppression of evidence, concluding that subpoenaed witnesses who gave testimony before an investigating grand jury without a warning that they could have counsel if confused about their rights against self-incrimination were denied their rights against self incrimination. The court also affirmed the quash of indictments and presentments based in part on the constitutionally impermissible testimony, as defendants were judicially compelled to testify without sufficient warning or protection concerning their right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant laundromat owner sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which sustained appellee state's imposition and calculation of sales and use taxes upon appellant's business. Appellant asserted that the Tax Act of 1963 for Education, 72 P.S. &sect; 3403-1 et seq., did not apply to his business, that the method of assessment did not comply with the Tax Act, and that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state conducted an audit of appellant laundromat owner's business and calculated that it owed additional taxes. Appellant prosecuted unsuccessful administrative appeals and then sought judicial review in the trial court, which sustained the state's position in all respects. On appeal, the court held that appellant did work for his customers -- through his machines -- and that work was a service covered by the Tax Act of 1963 for Education, 72 P.S. &sect; 3403-1 et seq. The court found that the record was devoid of any evidence that the total tax due under appellant's theory would be any less than that found due under the appellee's auditor's theory, so appellant failed to sustain his burden of showing that the assessment was incorrect. Further, rounding off the tax due from any particular sale at retail to the next higher full cent was the only practicable way in which appellee could ensure that it received the basic tax rate. That being so, the bracket schedule's classification of separate sales at retail in terms of purchase price was reasonable and the Act did not violate the uniformity, due process, or equal protection clauses of the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that appellant laundromat owner's business provided a service covered by the Tax Act of 1963 for Education and that appellant did not satisfy his burden of showing that the state's calculation of his taxes was unreasonable or unconstitutional. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which sustained appellee state's imposition and calculation of the taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which granted an application for nolle prosequi by the Commonwealth and denied defendant's demands for trial following the reversal of defendant's conviction for first degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's grant of an application for nolle prosequi filed by the Commonwealth. The trial court had previously ordered the case put on a deferred indictment status for a period not to exceed six months. Defendant was awaiting his new trial following the reversal of his conviction for first degree murder and claimed that the delay violated his right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court agreed and vacated the nolle prosequi. The justifications provided by the Commonwealth for the nolle prosequi were insufficient to warrant the delay. Where one witness was hopelessly insane, and the only other known potential witness denied that he had any evidence to offer, there was scant basis to expect the possibility of trial in the foreseeable future. The Commonwealth contended that since appellant stood indicted for murder, which had no statute of limitations, a greater delay in bringing him to trial was permissible. The court found that factor relevant, but insufficient to warrant extension of the delay, which already exceeded 10 months. The court ordered the Commonwealth either proceed to trial or be barred from further prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that appellants should have been afforded the rights of procedural due process. The court determined that a decision on an application for a branch bank was judicial in nature and involved substantial property rights and that the Department's action represented judicial action by an administrative agency. The court then determined that appellants' should have been afforded notice, a hearing, the opportunity to present evidence, and access to the application and supporting data when confronted with a proposal for a new branch.

The trial court affirmed the findings in part and reduced the revocation to a six-month suspension. The superior court affirmed. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 8(11) was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend XIV because the advertising restrictions applicable to dangerous or narcotic drugs did not bear a reasonable relationship to the goals sought to be achieved by the legislation, which the state claimed were to minimize the use of such drugs, to aid pharmacists in monitoring prescriptions, and to prevent such drugs from sitting on shelves too long and deteriorating.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chiropractic professional association challenged the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed that 63 Pa. Stat. &sect; 615, stating that attendance at a conference of a particular chiropractic society would satisfy chiropractic license and registration standards, was unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 and art. II, &sect; 1, but could be made valid by severing the reference to the particular society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted 63 Pa. Stat. &sect; 615 which provided that chiropractors could fulfill their annual continuing educational requirement for licensing purposes by attending a conference held by the Pennsylvania Chiropractic Society (&quot;PAS&quot;), or an equivalent conference; a PAS conference did not have to be approved as meeting continuing educational requirements, but any other conference did. Appellant, a chiropractic professional association, argued that section 615 was unconstitutional. The court held that section 615 was an unlawful special law under Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 because there was no necessity for the specific exemption from certified compliance with professional educational requirements which the statute extended to a PAS conference; was an unlawful delegation to PAS under Pa. Const. art. II, &sect;1 of the legislative power to determine the requirements of chiropractic continuing education because the statute did not provide any guide or criterion; and that the statute could not be saved by severance of the unconstitutional reference to PAS because this reference was essentially and inseparably connected in substance to the rest of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the Superior Court because the statute in question (stating that attendance at a conference of a particular chiropractic society would satisfy chiropractic license and registration standards), which was unconstitutional under the Pennsylvania Constitution as a special law and improper delegation of legislative power, could not be made valid by rewriting it so as to avoid constitutional infirmities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review when their rental property was declared unfit for human habitation, and pursuant to the Rent Withholding Act (the Act), 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1700-1, their tenants put their rent monies in an escrow account. Appellants argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not define &quot;unfit for human habitation&quot;, was vague, and permitted the taking of their property without due process of law. The court affirmed, finding that the Act was constitutional. The court found that the legislature did not have to include every detail of administration in a statute, but could confer discretion in connection with the execution of the statute. It found that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague by failing to include a definition for &quot;unfit for human habitation&quot; because other statutes defined the term so that ample notice was available to a landlord of the standards to which his property must conform. The court found it was not an unconstitutional taking of appellants' property to require them to maintain it to a certain standard because there was a legitimate public purpose in imposing such requirements, which was to insure affordable and safe housing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree finding the statutory procedure for rent withholding was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because it failed to define &quot;unfit for human habitation&quot;, was not vague, did not permit the taking of appellants' property without due process of law, and was, therefore, a proper exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

Appellees alleged that the tax was, in actuality, a tax on the real estate itself, not a use tax, and that it violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 (1968), because it treated commercial property differently from other types of real property. The trial court held that the tax was unconstitutional. Appellant school district sought review of the trial court's decision. The court reversed, holding that the tax did not violate the Uniformity Clause because it was a valid privilege or excise tax on the use of commercial and industrial real estate and not a tax on the real estate itself. The court determined that the use of property was distinguishable from the ownership of property and that the former could be taxed without running afoul of the Uniformity Clause.</SPAN></P>

As to the other appellants, preliminary objections were filed and sustained by the trial court and appellants' complaint was dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed because it found that any possible harm suffered by appellants was too speculative to give them standing to pursue the underlying action. Appellants claimed that if those who obtained absentee ballots voted for candidates other than those for whom appellants voted for, it would cause a dilution of appellants' votes.

The court affirmed, holding that the act required no alleged wrongdoing before an investigation; the privilege against self-incrimination did not apply under the required record doctrine, wherein certain records were required to be kept by law, and the doctrine applied to appellant because he voluntarily entered a field that required state licensing; and the administrative search was within appellee's authority, not too indefinite, and the information was relevant as the act required that the accounts be carefully kept.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee school district levied a tax on occupations as assessed by its county. Attacking both the assessments and the tax resolution, appellant taxpayers brought actions to enjoin appellees, the school district and its tax collectors, from collecting the tax. The trial court entered a final decree that dismissed the complaints, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed. The court stated that there were no substantial contentions that concerned the constitutionality of the assessment; it was the irregular exercise of the power that was questioned. The legislature provided an adequate remedy in the form of appeal from the assessment to a Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes and from that body's order to a court of common pleas. Thus, a court of equity was not to countenance a direct attack upon the assessments. In the absence of any showing that the tax was based solely on taxpayers' income, appellants' contention that the tax was a disguised income tax that violated state law was without merit. The Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, applied to occupation taxes. The tax was not in violation of it, for a classification based on the age of 21 was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

In addition, a statutory appeals route was available to them. The court also rejected appellants' argument that the tax was not timely assessed because the statutory time limit was directory rather than mandatory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which granted a variance to appellee landowner to permit the erection of 59 apartment units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowner applied for a variance from the existing zoned scheme of single home residential use in order to construct 59 apartment units on his land. The trial court granted the variance because it concluded that the property involved was subject to a unique and unnecessary hardship. On review sought by appellant residents, the court found that appellee could not prove that the hardship, which burdened his land, was unnecessary rather than self-inflicted. There was evidence that appellee could not develop his land for residential purposes at a profit because there was no market for homes in the price range that he needed to construct in order to make a profit on his investment. The court held that this reason for requesting a variance did not comprise an unnecessary hardship but rather poor judgment on the part of appellee. The court reversed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the lower court that granted a variance to appellee landowner to construct apartment units over the objection of appellant residents because there was no evidence that the strict application of the terms of the existing zoning statute would result in unnecessary hardship to appellee. Rather, the evidence showed that any hardship to appellee was of his own making and thus, he could not be heard to complain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Asserting his privilege against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V, defendant witness refused to answer questions put by a grand jury, even though he had been granted immunity under the Pennsylvania Immunity Act, 19 P.S. &sect; 640.1-6. A common pleas court ordered defendant to prison for six months unless he sooner purged himself of contempt by testifying before the grand jury. Defendant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court stated that answers could be compelled regardless of the privilege against self-incrimination if there was immunity from federal and state use of the compelled testimony or its fruits in connection with a criminal prosecution against the person testifying. The court held that 19 P.S. &sect; 640.1-6 provided transactional immunity, which precluded prosecution for any transaction that concerned the testimony that was compelled. The court stated that the conditional nature of the contempt sentence meant that it was for civil contempt. Thus, defendant was not entitled to a jury trial of the matter. The common pleas court had legal and constitutional authority to use its remedial power of civil contempt to force compliance with its lawful order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was injured while in the course of his employment.

Relying upon Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77 &sect; 481, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, precluded the enactment of legislation limiting the amount of compensation payable to employees for injuries other than those arising in the course of their employment. Provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, found in Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77 &sect; 481, limited payment to injured employees by those other than employers, or employers and employees jointly. The court found that the purpose of art.

On appeal the court vacated the order and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on the motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a demonstration that protested the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, defendant exposed a United States flag on which was printed the words, &quot;make love not war&quot; and &quot;the new American revolutionaries.&quot; Defendant was convicted of desecrating the American flag under 18 P.S. &sect; 4211. The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, which affirmed the conviction. The court did not reach defendant's argument that &sect; 4211 was unconstitutional. The court found that defendant was not guilty under the statute because &sect; 4211 stated that the section did not apply to political demonstrations. The court agreed with the lower court's finding that defendant was in fact participating in a political demonstration. The court found that if defendant's demonstration was not considered political, it would be difficult to determine if demonstrations were or were not political. Without fair warning and a standard to decide guilt, &sect; 4211 would be violative of due process. The court held that it would not define a political demonstration as one only conducted by the government because such a narrow definition would be arbitrary and would result in a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees sought a declaration that the occupational privilege tax imposed by appellee employer constituted an unconstitutional method of tax collection. They also sought appropriate injunctive relief against the collection of the tax. The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania) rendered judgment in favor of the employer. The employees sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees claimed that the enabling statute, the Local Tax Enabling Act (Act 511), 53 P.S. &sect; 6901 et seq. (Supp. 1970), did not authorize a local municipality to pass an ordinance requiring employers to collect an occupational privilege tax. Thus, they argued that the local ordinance was unconstitutional insofar as it provided that the tax was to be collected by employers such as their employer. The court rejected this claim and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court found that Act 511 authorized certain political subdivisions to levy, assess, and collect or provide for the levying, assessment, and collection of such taxes as they determined. The court held that this was sufficiently broad to permit the tax to be collected directly by a taxpayer's employer, who would forward the taxes to the taxing authority. The court further found that the general provision for the collection of taxes under Act 511 was broad enough to permit employers' collection of the tax. The court held that the collection of the occupational privilege tax by the employer was an efficient and reasonable means of collection and did not prejudice the employees to any extent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that upheld an employer's method of collection of an occupational privilege tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township sought reversal of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which overturned a zoning ordinance after the ordinance had been upheld by the zoning board upon a challenge to the constitutionality of the minimum lot requirements by appellee builder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee builder requested rezoning of land inside appellant township. The application was denied by the zoning board, and appellee challenged the decision in the trial court, arguing that the zoning ordinance as applied was unconstitutional. The trial court reversed, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Although the trial court erred in making new findings of fact without taking additional testimony, it had independent grounds for affirmance. The ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellant's scheme of zoning had an exclusionary purpose and result. It limited the minimum lot sizes to ones that were much larger than were reasonably necessary for houses. As such, the ordinance was not within appellant's police power and was, instead, a violation of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV. Appellant's argument that a smaller lot size would create a sewerage problem were without merit, as were appellant's other arguments. The court refused to allow appellant to keep people out, rather than make community improvements A zoning ordinance whose primary purpose was to prevent the entrance of newcomers to avoid future burdens on public services was not valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the zoning ordinance of appellant township was unconstitutional. Appellee builder's request for rezoning should have been approved by the zoning board because the ordinance was an unconstitutional exercise of appellant's police power because it violated the property rights in the fifth and fourteenth amendments. Its purpose was to keep people out rather than to make community improvements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted in New York for grand larceny and conspiracy to commit grand larceny.

The lower court denied the writs. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the record sufficiently established that defendants committed a crime under the laws of New York and that the extradition papers were in proper order. Evidence also established that the conspiracy was hatched by defendants' coconspirators in New York. As participants in the conspiracy, defendants could have been extradited to New York even though they were not in that jurisdiction at any time pursuant to &sect; 6 of the Act, 19 P.S. &sect; 191.6 (1941).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Erie County (Pennsylvania), which entered a jury verdict convicting defendant of second degree murder and sentenced defendant to a term of 10 to 20 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to a term of 10 to 20 years' in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a new trial on the ground of after-discovered evidence because a witness's repudiation of his testimony at defendant's trial that defendant was involved in the crime was unlikely to compel a different result because the witness subsequently repudiated his repudiation. The court found that the trial court erred in failing to suppress defendant's oral statement because the &quot;waiver&quot; signed by defendant was ineffective as it was undisputed that, at the time he signed it, he had not been informed of the nature of the crime about which he was to be questioned. However, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the statement could not have harmed defendant where his own testimony at trial was identical. The trial court also erred in permitting a witness to testify where defendant's evidence showed that the witness was incompetent. However, it was not a reversible error because the evidence pertaining to the witness's alleged mental disorder was submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment because a witness's repudiation of his testimony at defendant's trial that defendant was involved in the crime was unlikely compel a different result because the witness subsequently repudiated his repudiation. Moreover, the admission of defendant's oral statement taken in violation of his Miranda rights was a harmless error where his own testimony at trial was identical to the statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was jointly indicted with two other individuals for the unlawful killing of the deceased during the perpetration of an armed robbery. Each defendant was tried separately. Each was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant sought review of the decision alleging that the admission into evidence of his prior criminal record during his trial constituted a denial of due process. The court affirmed holding that while the prior record and the lower court's action both involved crimes against the person, robbery, and the use or possession of a deadly weapon, that it could not find that the similarity was of itself so prejudicial as to amount to a denial of due process. The court determined that the cumulative weight of the evidence adduced at trial regarding defendant's guilt was overwhelming and in their view more than offset any likelihood that the disputed introduction of defendant's prior criminal record prejudiced the jury's determination on the issue of guilt.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and vacated the trial court's decree granting the injunction. The court held that although appellee had standing generally to initiate an injunctive proceeding against an allegedly obscene movie, the movie shown by appellant was not obscene. The court held that a different standard should not be used when dealing with motion pictures, reasoning that the impact of an obscene work is not always greater on film and that there was no precedent that movies were to be treated differently than other media. The court noted that there was testimony that the dominant theme of the movie was loneliness, and not sexually based. The movie's story of homosexual love, by present moral standards, did not appeal to a viewer's prurient interest in sex. Appellee failed to prove that the movie affronted community standards relating to sexual matters. The court held that the testimony of appellant's witnesses demonstrated that the film had redeeming social value in that it showed the effect of a lack of parental love.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, priest and parishioners, brought an action against appellants, hierarchical church organization and others, seeking an injunction against appellants' alleged interference with their right to control the parish. Appellants counterclaimed, seeking an injunction to restrain a competing hierarchical church organization's influence over the church. The lower court ruled that the church was under the jurisdiction of the competing hierarchical church organization. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that under the Lay Control of Church Property Act, 10 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 81 (1935), the church property remained subject to the control of appellants. The court held that the constitutional protection of hierarchical organization precluded not only legislative and judicial action that would have destroyed church government, but also action by church members themselves that effected a transfer of church property from the control of one hierarchy into the hands of a competing hierarchy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant church member initiated suit after appellee pastor abolished the selection of trustees by parish election and instituted a body composed of parishioners appointed by the parish priest. This action was in response to the Lay Control of Church Property Act (Act), Act of June 20, 1935, 10 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81, which transferred control of church property from the hands of the church laity to the authorized representatives of the church to which the church property was dedicated. The trial court decreed that the church since its founding was united with the Greek Catholic Church under the Pope, or a Uniate church. Thus, under the Act, the church had to remain under the authority of the Roman Pontiff. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court's finding that the church was a Uniate church was supported by evidence in the record of the church's history, including the manner in which the church members redressed their grievances through the channels of the Uniate church, the recitation of faith by new members showing their allegiance to the Pope of Rome, the ordination of Uniate priests at the church, and the church's contributions to the Holy See at Rome.</SPAN></P>

XIV. The court noted that the statute created a classification as to placement on the general election ballot between those who had shown the mandated amount of public support and those who had not. The court found that the avoidance of an unduly complicated ballot was a reasonable basis for this distinction. The statute also distinguished between statewide elections and local elections because candidates of local elections needed to receive a larger percentage of votes cast in the general election to be considered a political party than candidates in a state election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to overturn his prior commitment to a state hospital based on a sanity commissions report which determined that he was incompetent to stand trial on five counts of murder. Defendant contended that the sanity commission violated U.S. Const. amend. VI and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, after a hearing before a sanity commission, was found incompetent to proceed to trial on five counts of murder. A lower court denied his writ of habeas corpus to overturn the order of commitment. Defendant contended that the order of commitment denied his U.S. Const. amend. VI and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6,9 rights to a jury trial. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury trial to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. The court denied that defendant's commitment was a penalty more severe than what a trial could impose and that his constitutional rights were violated by the commitment without a trial. The court also denied defendant's claim that he was entitled to a speedy trial, that hearsay was error in his commitment proceeding, and that his constitutional right to confrontation and Miranda rights were violated. The court held that none of these rights were applicable because the sanity commission hearing was not criminal in character because it was only used to determine defendant's competence, not his guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the lower court, which affirmed defendant's commitment to a state hospital after having been ruled incompetent to stand trial on five counts of murder. The court held that defendant's sixth amendment rights to a jury trial, that his speedy trial rights, right to confrontation, right to have hearsay excluded, and Miranda rights were not violated because the sanity commission hearing was not criminal in character.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the conviction of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of contempt and sentenced him to a total of five years imprisonment, arising out of defendant's actions at his trial for perjury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for contempt due to his actions that were committed in the presence of the trial court, which included throwing a book at the judge and disrespectful comments. The court of appeals found that pursuant to 17 P.S. &sect; 2041 defendant's conduct was so offensive to the administration of justice that conviction and sentence were appropriate and justified. Defendant contended that the summary procedure used in his case was unconstitutional, because he was denied a trial by jury. The court affirmed, and found that the tradition of nonjury trials for contempts was more firmly established than the view that states could have dispensed with jury trials in normal criminal prosecutions. The court determined that defendant's case began long before a case came down that defendant relied on, which held that the constitutional guarantees of jury trial extended to serious criminal contempts. The court held that the case relied on by defendant did not need to be applied retroactively. The court also determined that, the adverse effects on the administration of justice of invalidating all serious contempt convictions would likely have been substantial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's contempt conviction, because a subsequent case that defendant relied on, which extended jury trials to serious criminal contempt cases did not need to be applied retroactively, and because of the likely adverse effects on the administration of justice that would have been caused by invalidating all serious contempt convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) for criminal contempt based on appellant's verbal abuse of the trial judge during various phases of the trial to disrupt the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty on counts of holding hostages in a penal institution and prison breach. Acting as his own trial counsel, appellant subjected the judge to verbal abuse and other misconduct to intentionally disrupt the trial. The judge did not warn appellant about his contemptuous conduct during trial. At sentencing, appellant was given consecutive sentences for the prison-related convictions, and 11 separate consecutive sentences for the contempt offenses of no less than one year and no more than two years. The contempt offenses were not tried to a jury; nor did appellant receive notice thereof prior to sentencing. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that appellant's contempt convictions occurred two years before the U.S. Supreme Court imposed a jury requirement for criminal contempt cases punishable by a two year prison sentence. Due process is not required for contempt committed in the presence of a judge in open court, and the trial judge did not have a duty to warn appellant during the trial of his contemptuous conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for criminal contempt.

Each appellant sought relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, and their cases were consolidated. The court concluded that, in the event appellants or any convicted murderers filed direct appeals and gained a retrial, the commonwealth could not seek the death penalty in the retrial, because such a retrial violated appellants' constitutional guarantees of due process, equal protection, and the right to be free from double jeopardy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patrolman challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania),which sustained appellee county commissioners' demurrer to appellant's mandamus action seeking to compel his promotion to sergeant and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patrolman took a written civil service examination for the position of sergeant. Appellant placed third on the eligible list, but three positions for sergeant were subsequently filled by patrolmen lower on the eligible list. Appellant sought a writ of mandamus to compel his promotion by appellee county commissioners to sergeant and for damages due to the pay differential. The trial court sustained appellees' demurrer. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded. The court, accepting appellant's interpretation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit 16, &sect; 4516, stated that the only way to ascertain merit was by a written test. Other criteria were not authorized. Further, the court found that language in the Second Class Cities Code supported its position. Next, the court found no support for appellees' argument that the interpretation adopted by appellant was an unconstitutional restriction for the discretion of the appointing authority. Finally, the court found that it was not necessary for appellant to join as indispensable parties those individuals appointed from lower positions on the list.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's denial of appellant patrolman's request for a writ of mandamus for promotion to sergeant because appellee county commissioners were not authorized under the promotions statute to use any criteria for promotion other than by written test. The cause was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

In both, appellant taxpayers sought to enjoin appellee industrial development authorities acting on acquisition agreements entered into by appellees.

The companies were to use funds generated by the sale of the revenue bonds issued by appellees to construct manufacturing plants. The companies were committed to long term leases of the property and were to pay an amount equal to the taxes they would have paid had the property not been owned by a tax exempt entity. The court determined that the bonds constituted neither debt nor an extension of credit to a private entity. The court determined that public funds were being used for a public purpose because of the generation of industry and employment. The court ruled in favor of appellees, and denied one appellant's request for injunction and affirmed a decree in favor of the other appellee.</SPAN></P>

The court first admonished that the injunction was improperly granted because there was no attempt to give notice of the hearing despite there being no irreparable injury as to justify the abandonment of the precious safeguard of an adversary hearing. The court also admonished that even if a proper hearing had been held the motion picture was protected by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech until judicially adjudged obscene.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayer was in the business of investments, which was conducted outside Pennsylvania. Appellee acquired real estate in Pennsylvania that it rented to tenants. In computing its 1962 franchise tax, appellee took the depreciated value of its real estate and subtracted therefrom its mortgage balance. Commonwealth settled the tax by including both the real estate and securities in determining the value of taxpayer's capital stock. On appeal, the trial court deemed the correct tax to be that which appellee reported. The court affirmed. The court found that for purposes of computing the franchise tax imposed under 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1871, the value of the taxpayer's capital stock not used in connection with the privilege of doing business in Pennsylvania had to be eliminated from the computation. Here, appellee's presence in Pennsylvania was limited to ownership of real estate and its investment activity outside Pennsylvania was unconnected therewith.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which reduced appellee taxpayer's franchise tax, because the commonwealth could only not include both appellee's real estate and investment activities in the computation of the tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions for child support were brought on behalf of two mothers against two defendants. Because the two actions involved the identical question, they were consolidated for argument. One defendant was charged with fornication and bastardy, that was later dropped, and the other petition did not cite any statute. The trial court, in both actions, denied defendants' requests for a jury trial, determined paternity, and ordered them to pay child support. The common question was whether the legislature, in enacting the Civil Procedural Support Act, 62 P.S. &sect; 2043.31 et seq., intended to abrogate a putative father's right to a jury trial to decide paternity in violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that statutes which tended to infringe on the right to trial by jury had to be strictly construed. The right to jury trial had been deemed so important that the court had previously held that absent specific legislative authorization, when a defendant pleaded not guilty, the courts had no power to try the case without a jury, even if the defendant waived his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A general county election was held to elect three county commissioners. The county board of elections tallied the absentee votes and applied the tallies to the districts in which the absentee voters resided. Appellant candidates objected to the counting of the absentee ballots. The county board of elections ruled against appellants, and the trial court upheld the ruling. The court affirmed. The court rejected appellants' argument that 25 P. S. &sect; 3146.8, which provided that the county board of elections had to canvass all absentee ballots, was unconstitutional. The framers of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 19 (currently Pa. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14) did not intend that the actual counting of absentee ballots had to occur in local election districts rather than on a county-wide basis. To require hearings on contested absentee ballots in 243 places, rather than in one centralized location, was highly impractical. The constitutional framers intended not that the local election districts would count the absentee ballots, but that the computation of the absentee votes would appear on the return in the district where it belonged. The county board of elections had complied with this procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of York County (Pennsylvania) that denied his constitutional challenge to the tabulation of absentee ballots by the county election board rather than the district election board in violation of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a candidate for a state senate seat. After ballots were cast, the county board of elections refused his motion to stop counting absentee ballots to prevent a violation of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 19. The trial court also denied his petition to stop the board's tabulation of the absentee ballots in which appellant reasserted the unconstitutionality of the Election Code, 25 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3146.1-3146.9. Appellant argued that the district election board, and not the county election board, should have counted the absentee ballots. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that a district election board only sat on one election day. After they tabulated the results on the voting machines or written ballots, their operation was at an end. The county board was a permanent body functioning continuously. Absentee ballots continued to arrive after the district election board ended. Nowhere in the constitution was there any requirement that absentee ballots be canvassed by a district election board and by no one else.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying a constitutional challenge to tabulation of absentee ballots by a county board of elections was affirmed because an act of the general assembly would not be declared unconstitutional unless it clearly, palpably and plainly violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation challenged an order of Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), dismissing appellant's complaint in mandamus seeking to compel appellee board of finance and revenue to refund corporate net income taxes paid by appellant. Appellant contended that its petitions seeking a refund were timely filed, under 72 P. S. &sect; 503.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented on this appeal was whether certain petitions seeking the refund of corporate net income taxes were timely filed with appellee board of finance and revenue board. The board denied appellant corporation's petitions for refund for lack of jurisdiction under 72 P. S. &sect; 503 of the Fiscal Code, in that the petitions were not timely filed. Appellant instituted an action of mandamus against appellee to compel it to grant the refunds. Under the provisions of that section, ordinarily, a refund petition had to be filed within two years of the payment of the tax involved or the settlement of the tax involved, whichever date was later, but, in other special statutorily-delineated situations, a five-year period was available dating from the payment of the tax involved. It was appellant's position that its tax refund petitions were timely filed within both the five year limitation period and the two year limitation period. The court found that appellant was not entitled to a refund because it failed to timely file within the two-year limitation period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that appellant corporation's refund petitions to appellee board of finance and revenue were not timely filed by appellant within the applicable statute of limitation, which provided for filing within two years of the payment of the tax involved, and the order of the court vacating a previous order was reaffirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipal gas companies challenged the constitutionality of a statute that permitted the imposition of an annual tax on its gross receipts by appellee tax authority. Appellants alleged that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 2181 (1967) violated the uniformity clause of Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it unconstitutionally permitted different tax treatment between municipal gas and electric companies. The trial court determined that the different tax treatment was constitutionally permissible. The court affirmed the decree of the trial court, finding that appellants failed to carry their heavy burden of showing that there existed no reasonable basis for distinguishing gas from electric companies. The court held that the legislature could distinguish, for purposes of taxation, activities which were sufficiently unique despite the fact that the subjects so taxed were but one segment of a larger class engaged in similar activity. The court concluded that apart from the similarity of functions, it could not be gainsaid that gas and electricity were distinct power sources, each sufficiently unique to sustain separate tax treatment.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found that the appropriations made by appellant were insufficient to maintain the retirement system in an actuarially sound condition.

Appellant contended appellee's standing to institute a mandamus action and the scope of the order. On appeal, the court affirmed the modified order of the lower court, finding that appellee had a right independent of the public to support a mandamus action brought as a private litigant. The court stated that appellee had satisfied the conditions placed by a retirement system, his right to retirement benefits had become vested and that a contractual relationship had been established between the parties. The court vacated part of order that directed appellant to place sufficient funds to cover normal cost plus interest, and found it violative because it contained a directive for the performance of a future act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus, which defendant filed after being convicted of murder in the first degree. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order because defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by the admission at trial of defendant's confessions. The court determined that the only conclusion that was supported by the evidence was that the confessions were wholly voluntary and not coerced by any force, threats of force, or by any other means. The failure of the court stenographer to completely transcribe the testimony at trial did not entitle defendant to a writ of habeas corpus because defendant did not allege how he had been harmed. The court ruled that defendant could not use the mere passage of time as an asserted basis of prejudice against him where defendant waited 10 years before taking any action with regard to alleged deprivation of rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a grant of injunction to appellee township prohibiting appellants from constructing a trailer park, the court affirmed, holding that the land was zoned &quot;Farm Residential.&quot; Trailer parks were permitted only in districts zoned &quot;Neighborhood Commercial,&quot; when allowed by special exception. The court held that questions involving the constitutionality of zoning ordinances should not be heard by courts of equity, but should be tested through the ordinary zoning channels, application to the board of adjustment for relief, followed by an appeal to the court. Also, the same presumption of constitutional validity that attended an act of the legislature was equally applicable to municipal ordinances. The trailer park ordinance was a valid exercise of the police powers in regulating sewage, water supply, fire hazards, electrical hazards, roadways, minimum lot sizes, and similar matters. In addition, a municipality could properly refuse a building permit for a land use repugnant to a pending and later lawfully enacted zoning ordinance even though the application for the permit was made when the intended use conformed to existing regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As women convicted of offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, appellants fell within the mandatory and exclusive procedure and sentencing provisions of the Muncy Act (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 551 et seq. Pursuant to the Act, the trial courts sentenced appellants to indeterminate terms, with the maximum terms being those prescribed by law for the offenses committed. Appellants argued that the Act discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The intermediate court upheld the sentences in both cases. On consolidated review, the court reversed the judgments and remanded for resentencing. Under the Act, the court noted, a judge sentencing a woman had no discretion in fixing the maximum term of imprisonment. On the other hand, the court explained, a judge sentencing a man for the same crime could consider extenuating facts and factors pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1057. Finding no reasonable grounds for the imposition of longer or greater sentences for women than for men, the court held that the Act was arbitrary, discriminatory, and invalid under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

Eighty percent of appellee taxpayer's sales were filled by delivery from its own warehouse and the remaining twenty percent were filled by shipment from suppliers directly to appellee's customers. The trial court ruled in appellee's favor and found that those remaining sales were brokerage transactions rather than retail sales. The court reversed, holding that appellee was more than a negotiator between suppliers and its customers. It bought the goods involved on its own account and sold them to the customer on its own terms. Suppliers looked only to appellee for payment and appellee bore the risk of nonpayment by its customers. This indicated that appellee was a party to two separate transactions, one being a purchase from the supplier and one being a sale to its own customer. Thus, appellee was not one who merely negotiated a contract of sale between buyer and seller.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant railway company argued that by enacting 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 26, Congress had preempted state intervention in the area of flag protection. The court agreed, reasoning that the mechanical devices required by &sect; 26 performed the exact same function that manual flagging was intended to perform and that the language of &sect; 26 was broad enough to indicate that Congress had chosen to regulate the entire field of rear end collision prevention. In addition, the court noted that where federal language was broad enough to indicate preemption, a state law could not escape interdiction on the ground that it did not conflict with the federal regulations. The court therefore held that Congress had preempted the entire field and that the states were not even permitted to pass legislation that was supplemental to the federal rules.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, challenged the order of the superior court that dismissed appellant's cease and desist order against appellee company for the alleged unauthorized operation of a motor vehicle as a common carrier or contract carrier. Appellant claimed that the exceptions under the Public Utility Law, 66 P.S. &sect; 1102, were limited to transportation of materials used in the construction of public roads. The court affirmed the decision of the superior court. The court held that the language of the statute was plain and unambiguous that appellant's interpretation was too narrow. The court also held that appellant did not meet its heavy burden of proof that the statute was unconstitutional unless their interpretation of the statute was adopted. The exemption was properly limited to a certain class of vehicles, even though it was not limited to public roads.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the superior court that appellee company was not engaged in the unauthorized operation of a motor vehicle as a common carrier or contract carrier, as the language of the statute was plain and unambiguous and appellee was exempted from the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought reargument of their challenge to an order by the Superior Court (Pennsylvania) which affirmed their convictions by a jury for the offenses of operating a lottery and conspiracy to operate a lottery. Previously, allocatur was granted by the court affirming the lower courts' decisions, however in light of two decisions rendered by the United States Supreme Court. Appellants' petition for reargument was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of operating a lottery and conspiracy to operate a lottery. The decisions rendered in the United States Supreme Court required the court to re-examine its previous decision affirming appellants' convictions. The court reversed appellants' convictions and ordered a new trial because the two decisions of the Supreme Court changed the previous decision. Federal authorities seized the evidence against appellants under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 4411-4412. In one case, it was determined that failing to comply with either section was a violation of a privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that if a federal prosecution based upon violations of &sect; 4411 and &sect; 4412 infringed accused's privilege against self-incrimination and this privilege also applied to the states, then a state prosecution based upon the same evidence seized by federal officers would equally violate that privilege. The court further held that if the evidence violated the U.S. Const. amend. V when used in federal court then it equally violated the constitution when admitted in state court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's previous decision affirming appellants' convictions for operating a lottery and conspiracy to operate a lottery were reversed and a new trial granted because the court determined that the evidence used to convict appellants could not be constitutionally admitted in federal court and the identical constitutional violation would occur if the evidence was admitted in state court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania) that affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence after the jury found defendant guilty of trafficking in lottery tickets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Early in the morning, four police officers went to defendant's home with a body warrant for defendant and a search warrant for the premises. The officers banged on the door and announced in a loud voice that they were the police. When there was no response within 20 seconds, they broke in the door. Defendant was convicted of trafficking in lottery tickets. The court reversed his conviction and granted him a new trial because the search warrant's execution violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. Prior to entering a private home to conduct a search or to make an arrest, the officers had to give notice of their identity and purpose. The court held that held that the officers' forcible entry of defendant's home without announcing their purpose violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court also held that there were no exigent circumstances that justified the officers' entry without proper announcement. There was no evidence that defendant was fleeing or about to destroy evidence. The court did not address defendant's argument that the search warrant, which was based on a confidential informant's information, did not supply the underlying circumstances upon which the informant based his conclusions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower appellate court's order that affirmed the trial court's judgment, vacated the trial court's judgment of sentence for trafficking in lottery tickets, and granted defendant a new trial. The execution of a search warrant for defendant's home violated the Fourth Amendment because the police made a forcible entry without announcing their purpose. Moreover, there were no exigent circumstances justifying the forcible entry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed judgments convicting defendant of burglary, larceny, receiving stolen goods, and possession of burglary tools and denied his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary, larceny, receiving stolen goods, and possession of burglary tools. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial that was denied. The appellate court affirmed, and defendant sought review. The court reversed, finding that defendant's convictions rested in part upon the introduction in evidence, over objection, of a set of burglary tools and a brief case seized without a warrant from an automobile in defendant's possession at the time of his arrest. The court found that, as the search was unreasonable, under the U.S. Const. amend. IV, because it was not confined to &quot;the immediate vicinity of the arrest&quot; and could not be sustained as incidental, the evidence should have been excluded. Defendant was taken into custody in the house and was promptly handcuffed, the automobile was locked, and the police had the keys; therefore, the search was not necessary to prevent harm to the arresting officers, defendant's escape, or the destruction of evidence. The court found that defendant's apparent approval of the search was not free of intimidation or duress, thus it did not render the search lawful.</SPAN></P>
