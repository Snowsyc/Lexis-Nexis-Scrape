The court affirmed defendant's conviction, concluding that &sect; 22-16-20 was not vague and indefinite where it indicated that every killing under certain circumstances that was not manslaughter in the first degree was manslaughter in the second degree. The court stated that &sect; 22-16-20 simply provided that manslaughter in the second degree embraced all forms of criminal homicide which were neither murder nor manslaughter in the first degree. The language of &sect; 22-16-20 indicated that culpable negligence was only one of many unlawful acts constituting the crime and just because the statute encompassed many scenarios of criminal homicide did not make it vague. There was no contention that the homicide was either excusable or justifiable, so it must have been murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Native American, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court, Mellette County (South Dakota) of third-degree forgery. On appeal, he argued that the jury panel should have been quashed because Native Americans were systematically excluded from the jury list.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although Native Americans constituted 29.9 percent of the county's population, only about 8 percent were represented on the county jury lists in 1967, 1968, and 1969. There were no Native American names certified from 18 of the 23 jury districts in 1967, none from 19 of the districts in 1968, and none from 20 of the districts in 1969. One township with a population that was 60 percent Native American had not certified a person of Native American descent during the past 10 years, and another that was over 60 percent Native American had only returned one name during that time period. The court stated that this was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. The State had not satisfactorily rebutted this case merely by denying that Native Americans were systematically excluded from the jury lists or by offering testimony that officials were not familiar with Native Americans' qualifications to act as jurors. The court added that on retrial, an instruction on voluntary intoxication should be given because intent to defraud was an essential element of forgery and a jury could properly consider voluntary intoxication to determine the existence of intent.</SPAN></P>

Lower court found for respondents and against appellants, granting respondents attorney fees. Court found that reasonable attorney fees were allowed by statute in actions involving insurance companies that refused to pay. Because language of statute allowing fees included any insurance company contracts, contracts of indemnity and suretyship like that of respondent's contract were included as well.

Appellants contended, inter alia, that the Consumers Power District Act, S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 49-35 to 49-40, pursuant to which the power district was established, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the Act was not a proper legislative enactment under the police power. The source of all police power was public convenience and necessity and the circuit court was not allowed to consider the issue of public convenience and necessity or duplication of existing services. Affirming the circuit court's judgment, the court found that the legislature had the power to enact the Act, which authorized the creation of public power districts, because the manufacture and sale of electric power was a governmental function and there was no constitutional prohibition against a state's engaging in that business for the benefit of its people. Further, the court rejected appellants' contention that under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 49-35-11, the circuit court was not permitted to consider the issue of public convenience or necessity, holding that the statute provided only that at a hearing a judge shall determine whether the requisite petition conformed to statutory requirements and whether or not the power district was formed in good faith for equality of distribution of electric energy.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that habeas corpus was not available before trial in the absence of exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, a writ of habeas corpus was denied on behalf of person discharged on bail. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-27-1 contemplated that habeas corpus relief was available for persons restrained of their liberty under any color or pretense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesale distributor requested a permanent injunction to prevent the retail distributor from selling products sold by the wholesale distributor at prices less than those established by the Fair Trade Law. The trial court determined that the Fair Trade Law was unconstitutional as it applied to retail distributor, who was a non-signer to the fair price maintenance contract proposed by the wholesale distributor. On appeal, the wholesale distributor argued that the trial court erred when it found that the Fair Trade Law was unconstitutional. The court rejected the wholesale distributor's argument. The court reversed its earlier decision in Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. Owl Drug Co., 67 S.D. 523, 295 N.W. 292 (1940) that upheld the law as constitutional. The court reviewed the law and noted that many states had determined that their fair trade laws were unconstitutional as an unreasonable exercise of the police power. In this case, the court determined that the Fair Trade Law, as it applied to non-signers of price maintenance agreements, was unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power because it delegated the power to fix prices to a private person.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the owner had certain water rights that entitled him to divert a limited amount of water to irrigate a portion of his land for six months each year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Water for domestic and municipal uses and the irrigation of lands of water users within the district was obtained from the river, which flowed across the owner's land. The State and the water resources commission intervened, alleging that the irrigation district was authorized by law to regulate and control the development, conservation, and allotment of the waters according to principles of beneficial use and priority of appropriation. The trial court found that the owner had no appropriation rights of record for irrigation of lands owned by him and adjacent to the river and that such water that he had diverted would have been used beneficially by water users in the district. However, the trial court recognized the owner's vested rights as defined by S.D. Codified Laws 46 (1967). The court held that the evidence sustained the trial court's findings. However, the agreed with the owner that the judgment limiting the amount of water he could divert was not sustained by the evidence. The judgment was based on the commission's decision that purported to determine priorities and the quantity of water that the owner could divert.

The County alleged &sect;10-11-47 was not adopted in accordance with the South Dakota Constitution. The court rejected that contention and upheld the trial court's decision. Relying on the &quot;modified journal entry&quot; method, the court concluded that Senate Bill 109, the precursor to &sect;10-11-47, was passed in accordance with S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, which required final passage to be taken upon its last reading, and the yeas and nays to be entered upon the journal. Even if the first vote of the Senate was not a vote on final passage, the later action taken by the Senate approving Senate Bill 109 as amended by the House by roll call vote entered in the journal where the full content of the bill and title were reported, erased all doubt the Senate was fully advised of its contents and amendments made. There was compliance by the presiding officers of each House with S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 19. The enrolled act on file in the office of the Secretary of State contained the signatures of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was alleged to have at a specified place within the city drove a Chevrolet automobile side by side with another vehicle simulating a temporary race at a high rate of speed with excessive engine noise. Defendant contended that the lower court erred when it denied him a jury trial. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury trial in the trial of an action for violating an ordinance. Municipal ordinances were sui generis in nature, and not the type of criminal actions under which the constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial by jury applied. Municipal ordinances had never been classified as &quot;cases at law&quot; or &quot;criminal actions&quot; either historically or at common law. Nor did the legislature create a right to a jury trial for municipal ordinances. The legislature had always treated prosecutions under city ordinances as sui generis. The court rejected defendant's challenge that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions were presented to the commissioners seeking the organization of acres of land as an irrigation district. A hearing was scheduled. Some owners of land within the proposed district petitioned that their land be excluded, while other owners of land, not in the proposed district, petitioned that their lands be included. The commissioners denied the counter petitions, but granted petitions for exclusion. A resolution was adopted by the commissioners, which established, named and defined the boundaries of the irrigation district and divided it into three divisions. A second resolution fixed the time and procedure for a special election to determine whether the district should be organized. The landowners appealed claiming that the law required copies of the resolutions to be filed with the state engineer and that failure to do so rendered the proceedings void. The court noted that it could be that the report of the water resources commission was based in part on hearsay, but that was permissible under the statute providing for the investigation and report. The court found that it was reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended the report to have evidentiary value.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 95, &sect; 1(d)(3), codified as S.D.

The trial court overruled defendant's demurrer. On intermediate appeal, the court reversed the trial court's ruling, reasoning that the statute did not classify LSD as a hallucinogenic drug and reference to regulations promulgated under the Federal Act had to be made to determine if a crime had been charged. The statute did not adopt the federal regulations at a given time but attempted to adopt any and all regulations and changes therein promulgated under the Federal Act in futuro ad infinitum. The South Dakota Legislature could not constitutionally adopt future regulations. The statute was an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners attacked the constitutionality of 1967 S.D. Laws ch. 230, which purported to authorize municipal corporations to acquire and maintain public convention halls and to finance the cost thereof in whole or in part by special assessment of certain privately owned property within the assessment district. The trial court ruled against the property owners. In reversing, the court found 1967 S.D. Laws ch. 230 to be unconstitutional because the benefit conferred by such a structure was general to the community and could not have been translated into a specific benefit to commercial and other nonexempt real estate within the city. To qualify for special assessment, it had to have been actual, physical, and material and not merely speculative or conjectural. It was obvious that much real property within the proposed district by virtue of its location and the nature of its use could not have possibly been specially benefited by a public convention hall and thus the challenged law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rents were payable solely from appropriations to be made by the legislature and any revenues derived from the operation of the leased premises.

The court stated that the source of payment of the bonds would be rents payable from appropriations made or to be made by the legislature. The proposed leases would provide for the payment of annual rentals from available appropriations. They would not have the effect of creating an immediate debt or liability in the aggregate amounts of the future rents. An appropriation of money which was to be satisfied out of current revenues for the year did not create an indebtedness. The availability of appropriations was within the exclusive control of the legislature. Since the stipulation of the State to pay rents to the Authority was subject to available appropriations and current revenues, the inhibition of the debt limitation provisions of the Constitution did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 254 was unconstitutional and which granted a writ sought by respondents, consumers of electricity on land annexed by the city and others, to enjoin the South Dakota Electric Mediation Board from deciding a dispute between the city and a utility company as to which of them was to supply electricity on the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1965 S.D. Laws ch. 254 created the Board, which was given quasi-judicial powers to determine which electrical supplier would provide electric service in certain areas. Six members of the Board were to be appointed by the governor from lists supplied by utility associations; one was to be a circuit judge of the judicial circuit in which a protest was filed. After a dispute arose concerning provision of services on land that the city annexed, the city asked that the Board be convened. The consumers, who had requested service from the utility company, sought to prohibit the Board from acting. In affirming the judgment that the statute was unconstitutional, the court held that in acting as chairman, secretary, and a member of the Board, the circuit judge was not acting in his judicial capacity. Under the separation of powers doctrine, a circuit judge could exercise only judicial power. The statute unconstitutionally attempted to impose nonjudicial duties on the circuit judge that were shared with members appointed by the executive department. The circuit judge's membership was an integral part of the operation of the statute; therefore, the entire statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the statute's authorization to maintain buildings did not violate the state constitution and the authority granted to municipalities by the statute was not an unlawful delegation of authority.

The distributor had contract with most of the retailers that prohibited them from selling the beverages below a certain minimum price.

The trial court denied the injunction and the court affirmed. Although the court found that the trial court's reasoning was incorrect it found that the result was. The court found that an injunction was not proper because the distributor had failed to prove that the commodities were in &quot;free and open competition&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 54.0402. Said fact was deemed admitted at the trial court level. However, the court found that the importance of &sect; 54.0402 to the general public warranted an exception to the rule that an admission in the pleadings rendered proof of the admitted fact unnecessary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The used car dealer was not licensed to sell new cars. When it sold new automobiles under its used motor vehicle dealer's license, the commissioner suspended its license for six months.

The commissioner appealed, and the court reversed. It held that the legislature had the authority under the police power to regulate the sale of motor vehicles for the protection and general welfare of the public. In adopting regulatory measures affecting the sale of motor vehicles the legislature could properly differentiate between dealers in new vehicles and dealers in used vehicles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Minnehaha County (South Dakota), which held that the bank was liable to sales tax claimed due appellee State on food sold to the bank's employees, repossessed merchandise sold, and use tax on food sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank, duly charted and national, made food and refreshments available to its employees and guests for sale in a cafeteria maintained by it for the convenience of those served. The legal incidence of the sales tax rested on the retailer-seller who was made liable for the payment thereof, and the tax was sustained. A national bank was held not liable for similar local sales tax on purchases made by it. The court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 57.4306(3) (Supp. 1960) required the bank, as a user, to pay the tax directly to the state commissioner of revenue because it was a tax proscribed by U.S. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5219. Thus, the court concluded South Dakota could not, as to a national bank, levy and collect a sales tax on the property it sold nor a use tax on the property it bought. The bank was liable to pay a use tax on the food and refreshments it sold, and where collection was not made, the retailer was liable for default in performance of its duty as such. The bank was liable as debtor to the State in the amount of use tax it failed to collect and pay over to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the bank recovery for sales tax paid. The judgment denying the bank recovery for the use tax and penalty on materials and supplies purchased outside the state for use by it in its banking business was reversed with directions to enter judgment for the bank in that amount.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the property's highest, best and most profitable use was for an automobile service station and one of the major considerations contributing to its value for such purpose was the right of access to two streets. Moreover, the court ruled that the referee correctly concluded that the landowner's right of access was substantially impaired and he suffered a compensable loss. The court found that the landowner's damages were different in kind and not merely in degree from that experienced by the general public and that the landowner's private property right of access was taken in the constitutional sense requiring compensation to be paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county commissioners sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court, Minnehaha County (South Dakota), which found that the part of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 12.0608 restricting the city to two commissioners denied electors of a city equal protection of the law and was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Fourteenth Amendment and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county was divided into five commissioner districts pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 12.0608, two of which comprised the city; the other three comprised the balance of the county. Under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 12.06, a county commissioner had to be a resident elector of the district and his nomination and election was by a vote of the electors of the district of which he was a resident elector. Thus, two of the commissioners were elected by and represented 65,466 persons (32,733 each) from the city and the three outside the city were elected by and represented 21,109 persons (7,036 each). The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the statutory election scheme resulted in inequality in the districts and disproportionate representation. The court held that the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; doctrine applied to the election of county commissioners and that such doctrine applied equally to both state and local elections, as well as federal elections. The court concluded that a classification that discriminated geographically deprived a citizen on his constitutional rights the same as one that discriminated by reason of race, creed, or color.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's disposition by deferring to the legislature to properly apportion the districts and otherwise affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the application, and an appeal was taken. The court noted that the provision imposed a tax upon gross receipts of any person from engaging or continuing in practice of any profession and making the tax inapplicable to persons engaged in practice of healing arts as defined by specified statutes. The court found that the provision was sufficiently definite to afford the Commissioner practical standards for applying the act without exercising legislative power. The court reasoned that mere difficulty in ascertaining the meaning of the statute or the fact that it was susceptible to different interpretations did not render it void. The court held that an act that was somewhat vague was valid unless it was so imperfect as to render it impossible to execute or ascertain legislative intent. Furthermore, the court held that exclusion of persons engaged in the practice of healing arts and veterinarians from sales tax imposed on gross receipts of persons engaging or continuing in the practice of any profession did not constitute an unconstitutional grant of immunity from taxation. The classification and exemptions were not arbitrary and were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners were in possession of contiguous lots on which residences had been built. Each granted a petroleum company a 60-day option to purchase his separate property. Within time limits, the company exercised the options. As a condition precedent to a binding obligation, the option agreements required the landowners to obtain from appropriate zoning and/or other necessary permits authorizing use of the property as a gasoline and oil service station and merchandise store. In response to the landowners' request to the board for the permit, the board responded that it needed more information, but that it did not think the area was suitable for the construction of a gasoline filling station. The court was satisfied that mandamus was a proper remedy under the circumstances to compel the board and its officers to issue the building permit. There was no violation or noncompliance with any building regulations or zoning ordinances, which could have served as a predicate for denial of the building permit. Moreover, the proposed gas station was a legitimate business and was not a nuisance in fact. Thus, there was no valid reason to deny the building permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Brown County (South Dakota), which entered in favor of appellee farmer, in the farmer's action against the railroad, pursuant to the State's railroad fencing statutes, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 52.0910 and &sect; 52.0911 (statutes), for damages arising out of the death and injury to his cows that were struck by a train. The railroad argued that the statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmer's land adjoined a right-of-way owned by the railroad. The farmer built a permanent fence around all of his land except the side abutting the right-of-way. The railroad had maintained a fence along its right-of-way, but the fence went into disrepair. The farmer's cows escaped and were killed or injured by a train. The trial court entered judgment against the railroad based on its liability under the statutes. The statutes imposed on the railroad a positive duty to construct and maintain a fence along the fourth side of an enclosure bordering its right-of-way when a landowner had constructed a fence on the other three sides. The railroad argued that due to the fact that the railroads no longer had a monopoly on passenger transportation that they once had, the statutes were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court ruled that the statutes were not unconstitutional. The court determined that the statutes reasonably promoted the public interest and welfare because, the court noted, the State was still geared to a farm and ranch economy and the statutes were needed in light of the fact that trains still operated across the State's predominantly open range country at great speeds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pupil and her father signed a written contract and they paid defendant $ 150 as advance tuition to attend the school. Defendant read the contract in its entirety before they signed it. Thereafter, for some reason not shown in the record, the pupil failed, or refused, to attend the school. The State filed charges of collecting tuition in excess of $ 25 in advance of a pupil's actual attendance at school, in violation of S. D. Codified Laws &sect; 13.1114 (Supp. 1960) against defendant. He was subsequently convicted. On appeal, he attacked the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted. Specifically, he argued that it was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the police power and deprived him of his freedom to contract in violation of S. D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The court held that the limitation on advance tuition was an unreasonable, unnecessary, and unwarranted invasion of defendant's freedom of contract. The statute was not inherently evil or harmful to the public unless accomplished by fraud, deception, or intent to injure. The failure of the Act to so limit its application made it an unwarranted and unjustifiable invasion of personal and private rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The respondent argued that she was the Employment Security Commissioner by virtue of her appointment in 1960. After the respondent's appointment, the state legislature amended the statute establishing the office of the commissioner by creating an office of commissioner and counsel. The relator was appointed to the new position but was barred from the office by respondent. The court ordered that the relator had the right to the office. The court rejected the respondent's argument that the enactment did not abolish the office. An enactment was repealed by necessary implication if the later law covered the whole subject matter of the previous law. The court found that it was clear that the legislature intended to require stricter professional qualifications of the candidate for the office of commissioner. The act resulted in a virtual abolition of the office held by the respondent. The court also found that the amended statute was not unconstitutional in that it assigned legal functions to officers who were not members of the attorney general's staff because the relator could render legal services within his department without impinging on the powers of the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The State's attorney, sheriff, and six other persons made affidavits that in their opinion defendant could have received a fair and impartial trial therein. The trial judge denied the motion. On that showing the trial court did not abuse the sound judicial discretion vested in it. The information met all constitutional and statutory requirements. It stated the elements of the crime with sufficient particularity to have apprised defendant of the crime charged and to have enabled him to prepare his defense and to be protected in the event of double jeopardy. On the complete record it appeared defendant had a fair trial and the evidence of his guilt was ample.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because, in violation of his constitutional privilege against self incrimination, he was compelled to give evidence against himself at a coroner's inquest, the trial court erred in failing to quash the information and in subsequently overruling a motion in arrest of judgment. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. Defendant had been subpoenaed to appear at a coroner's inquest. He was told that he would not be called to testify, but could testify if he wished. Shortly thereafter a complaint was filed charging defendant with manslaughter in the second degree, and his arrest and prosecution followed. After defendant was pointed out, and it was announced that he would not be called, but had a right to come forward and testify in his own behalf, he was not free to exercise an uncoerced volition. To then fail to testify was to publicly admit a sense of guilt. As the one against whom this proceeding was aimed he had an absolute constitutional right to be free of interrogation therein, whether guilty or innocent. An information directly connected with such an invasion of the constitutional privilege of defendant would, on motion, be quashed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmer owned land surrounded by United States government land on which he had a permit for his livestock to graze. At the condemnation proceedings, the Commission introduced plans for the construction of the highway, which included two 7x7 concrete cattle underpasses to allow the cattle to pass from one point to another and the construction of an interchange. The trial court granted the injunction upon the grounds that the above two elements were not constructed. The court reversed the judgment. First, the cattle underpasses had been constructed by the time of the appeal. Thus, the need for a continuing injunction as to that issue was obviated. As to the claim related to the failure to construct an interchange, the court noted that the plans provided that the interchange did not have to be constructed until a two-lane portion of the highway was constructed, which had not yet occurred. Damages were awarded to the farmer on the basis that an overhead crossing would be constructed at the interchange. The overhead crossing had not been omitted or eliminated from the plans and specifications. Thus, the farmer was not entitled to an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Communal corporation was formed for the purpose of acting as a communal colony for its members. After being formed, corporation leased 80 acres of land (augmenting the 5000 acres it already owned). Upon learning of that lease, state government moved to revoke corporation's charter on the theory that the purchase of additional land was an expansion of its activities and, therefore, a violation of state corporation law. Corporation argued that the statute cited was unconstitutionally vague, and the judge assigned the case agreed. State appealed. On appeal, the judgment below was modified, and as modified affirmed. In particular, the court held that the state corporation statute's clause permitting the revocation of corporate charters owing to the expansion of their activities was not unconstitutionally vague, did not improperly embrace multiple subjects, did not impair the obligations of a contract, did not infringe upon religious freedom, and did not deprive corporation of due process. However, it upheld that lower judge's decision on a nonconstitutional basis, i.e., corporation's activities in leasing 80 additional acres did not constitute an expansion of its activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal was granted on the grounds that the statute authorizing the laying out of a right of way over adjoining lands without the consent of the owner was unconstitutional. Plaintiff contended that the property owner had no interest in the mandamus proceeding; thus, he should not have been granted leave to intervene. The court ruled that the property owner had a sufficient interest in the proceeding to permit him to intervene. The interest that entitled a party to intervene was a direct interest, by which the intervening party was to obtain immediate gain or suffer loss by the judgment, which might be rendered between the original parties. To authorize an intervention, the interest was one that should be created by a claim to, or lien upon the property, which was the subject of litigation. The court reasoned that the property owner was accorded an interest in the litigation where plaintiff specifically demanded a right of way across the property owner's land. Consequently, the property owner had an interest in the litigation because he would obtain an immediate gain or suffer an immediate loss by the judgment rendered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment granting the property owner's motion to dismiss plaintiff's action.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer claimed that the financing provision of the resolution created a state debt in violation of S.D. Const. art. XIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Regents adopted a resolution under 1955 S.D.

The resolution provided that bonds would be issued to finance the project and that the bonds would be repaid from a special fund that contained revenues generated by the new dormitory facilities as well as those generated from existing college facilities in an amount not less than $ 500,000. The taxpayer contended that the resolution created a debt of the State that exceeded $ 100,000 and exceeded one-half of one percent of the assessed valuation of the State's property in violation of S.D. Const. art. XIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. Because the revenue bonds were to have been paid from the special fund and the state was not obligated to pay them from tax revenues, the Board of Regents claimed that the resolution did not create an impermissible State debt. The court agreed with the taxpayer that the resolution created an impermissible State debt in violation of S.D. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2. The court reasoned that although the bonds would not have been paid from tax revenues, they would have been paid from other State revenues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court restrained and enjoined the Board of Regents from pledging the income of dormitory facilities existing at a State College in payment of the revenue bonds it proposed to issue pursuant to a resolution to finance the construction of new dormitory facilities.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants contended that the requirement of the ordinance that an applicant shall have served an apprenticeship for at least three years as shown by an affidavit of a master or journeyman plumber imposed an unreasonable and arbitrary restriction upon a lawful occupation. The trial court's conviction was reversed. The court held that the affidavit requirement prevented otherwise qualified applicants from taking an examination and obtaining a license. The provision that no one would be licensed unless he had been employed as an assistant to a licensed undertaker continuously for three years was unreasonable in that it made essential a particular form of acquiring skill and knowledge. Thus, the provisions that limited the right to an applicant to take an examination to an applicant furnishing an affidavit attesting to his apprenticeship could not be sustained as a reasonable and valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

To the lay mind cadets were not involved in military service, but 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2 included cadets as part of those that composed the United States Army and South Dakota had not created an exception for cadets.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a nonresident, was refused a license to hunt migratory water fowl, but proceeded to hunt anyway. Subsequently, he killed a wild goose. He was charged with the unlawful killing of a migratory waterfowl. He appealed the conviction, asking the court to consider whether the enactment of this law, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25.0306(9), was within the power of the legislature. On review, the court found nothing that made absolute the right of nonresidents of the state to hunt migratory birds in this state on the same basis as residents. Thus, the court believed that no treaty had such a purpose. Rather, treaties were intended to conserve migratory birds. The state was at liberty to give migratory birds further protection than that given by the treaties, federal laws and regulations. The court stated that nonresidents constituted a peculiar source of evil at which this statute was aimed. It held that the trial court determined that the whole setup of the state's hunting laws and the eligibility for licenses was determined by residence, and no requirement of citizenship was involved. Hence, it affirmed defendant's conviction as within the power of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
