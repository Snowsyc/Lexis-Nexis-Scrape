</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of installing milk vending machines in violation of setback requirements and failure to obtain zoning permits. Defendant sought review and contended that milk vending machines were not structures under the language of the zoning code and that the zoning ordinance could not be constitutionally applied to milk vending machines because there was no reasonable relationship between a regulation requiring setbacks of machines in front and side yards and the purposes of zoning set forth in N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-32. The court affirmed. It found that the definition of a &quot;structure&quot; contained in the zoning ordinance was sufficiently broad to include milk vending machines. It further found that the zoning ordinance, as applied to milk vending machines, was constitutional because among the purposes set forth in N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-32 were to secure safety from fire and to lessen congestion in the streets. Because the setback requirements allowed access for fire equipment and reduced traffic congestion, the ordinance was constitutionally applied to milk vending machines.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved for correction of his sentence, alleging that he should not have been sentenced under the Sex Offender Act. His motion was granted and defendant was resentenced to two terms not less than 12 nor more than 15 years, to run consecutively with credit for time served. Defendant filed for post-conviction relief to have his new sentences run concurrently rather than consecutively. Relief was denied. Defendant's challenge to the judgment below was based upon his contention that, in correcting his admittedly illegal sentences, the sentencing judge was precluded from making the new sentences consecutive where they had previously been concurrent. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that, at the resentencing hearing, the judge was free to determine not only the term of years but also whether the sentence should be served consecutively or concurrently with the other valid sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the trial court (New Jersey), which convicted him of armed robbery, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:141-1 and 2A:151-5, and of carrying concealed pistols in an automobile without first having obtained a permit to carry the same, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-41. Three others were jointly indicted and tried with defendant for the same offenses, but the appeal was by defendant alone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and of carrying concealed pistols in an automobile without first having obtained a permit to carry the same. Defendant was identified as one of three robbers of a liquor store. Police officers found defendant and the other robbers in a car, where the officers also found two guns and other evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court found that it was not incumbent upon state to show that no permit had been issued to defendant. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-7 provided that the presence of a firearm in a vehicle was presumptive evidence of possession by all persons occupying the vehicle at the time. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-7 was not unconstitutional and that the trial court's quotation of it in charging the jury did not constitute reversible error. The trial judge instructed the jury that for a conviction, state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was aware of the presence of the guns in the automobile and was able to exercise intentional control over them. Also, the officers were legally justified in searching defendants and the car incidental to the arrest.</SPAN></P>

It was not incumbent upon state to show that no permit had been issued to defendant. Under the circumstances, the trial judge's reading of a statute to the jury was not reversible error. In addition, the police were legally justified in searching defendants and the car incidental to the arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forgery and false pretense. Thereafter defendant moved to the Borough of Belmar and failed to register with the chief of police as required by a municipality ordinance. Defendant challenged the ordinance, claiming that it was unconstitutional. The court held that the municipality had a right to enact the ordinance as a valid exercise of its police power to protect its citizens against ex-convicts. The court also determined that the ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause of the state or federal constitutional because it applied to all ex-convicts. In addition, the court stated that the ordinance did not violate defendant's right to travel or interfere with interstate commerce, since he had a right to freely come and go. Finally, the court concluded that the ordinance was not an ex post facto law nor a bill or attainder because the requirements of registering with the police was a small burden, and did not cause an undo hardship. The court upheld the ordinance in full, and found defendant guilty of violating it. The court ordered that defendant be given an opportunity to be heard before it would impose a penalty.</SPAN></P>

She alleged that the son suffered from a disabling mental disorder and that defendant was required to continue supporting him. The trial court entered orders pursuant N.J. Stat. &sect; 2A:34-23 compelling defendant to make support payments for the son and to reimburse plaintiff for certain expenses she incurred. On appeal, the court held that a divorced father was generally required to contribute to the care and maintenance of a disabled adult child. However, the court reversed the judgments, holding that N.J. Stat. &sect; 2A:34-23 authorized a trial court to compel a parent to make support payments for a disabled adult child only if the disability arose before the child reached the age of majority and that plaintiff failed to make such a showing with regard to her son.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that N. J. Stat.

The trial court deemed such pensions vested in plaintiffs under the authority of Pennsylvania judicial decisions. On appeal, the court reversed because it found Pennsylvania law irrelevant and found that there was no constitutional deprivation in requiring an out-of-state pensioner to surrender his public employment pension during the period of his public employment in New Jersey when the same rule applied to a New Jersey resident. It was not unreasonable for the legislature to have decided to put both classes of pensioners on the same footing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the evidence supported defendant's conviction because the jury was free to disbelieve defendant's claim of alibi, which was supported through defense witnesses. As to the harsher sentence following the second trial, the court recognized that this was generally not allowed in many jurisdictions but indicated that in this case the second sentence was based in part on information of facts which occurred subsequent to the first sentencing. Where that was the case, a second sentence which was harsher than the first did not violate any of defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court ruling, which convicted defendant of armed robbery and sentenced him to a term of six to eight years for the robbery and a consecutive term of one to two years for being armed while perpetrating the robbery. The court held that a harsher sentence imposed following defendant's second trial did not violate defendant's constitutional rights when based on more information available to the second sentencing judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police responded to a call alleging a group of juveniles were being unruly near an apartment building. After the police arrived and the group refused to disperse, an officer attempted to arrest the group, but they all fled in different directions. Later, defendant and her companions returned to the building. Thereafter, when defendant was told that she was under arrest and the officer attempted to take her into custody, she started pulling, struggling, kicking, swinging, and using foul language. Defendant was convicted for resisting arrest and uttering loud and offensive language, in violation of two city ordinances. The court affirmed the conviction, noting that similar ordinances and statutes whose wording resembled those involved have been held to be constitutionally valid. The court noted that the actions prohibited were such as would usually be considered as having a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the persons to whom addressed. The court articulated that it was difficult to conceive of more inflammatory words than those uttered by the defendant that the arresting officer was guilty of incest with his mother, uttered in a loud tone in the presence of witnesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for resisting arrest and uttering loud and offensive language, finding that the ordinances were not unconstitutionally vague because they adequately described the type of words that were forbidden.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, director of the Division of Taxation (director), filed a petition indicating that plaintiff township's assessor had deliberately delayed submitting required reports giving information with respect to the sales of property in the township until after the cut-off date used by defendant director, and expressing the belief that the reports were withheld in an attempt to increase the amount of state school aid paid to plaintiff. A hearing was held pursuant to a motion by defendant Division of Tax Appeals (division) on January 9th and then continued until January 16th. Plaintiff instituted this action in lieu of prerogative writs and obtained a restraint against any further hearings before defendant division. The trial court concluded that defendant division had no jurisdiction to continue the hearings any further than January 10 because the statutory language of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:1-35.4, which required that all hearings, reviews, and revisions of such tables be completed by that date, was mandatory.

Appellant claimed that he was the victim of an unlawful search and that the trial court erred in not granting his motion to suppress. The court found no merit in this argument because it found that the search was incident to a lawful arrest; appellant's person was restrained, and his freedom was restricted at the time of the search. Appellant also claimed that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-41 was too vague, but the court affirmed the conviction because it found that when read in context, it was clear that the statute meant that a knife was dangerous if its use could result in a fatal wound.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:69A-160 and 161, for four of seven council seats for which none of the candidates had received a majority vote. Defendant candidates contended that they should be declared elected because the three highest candidates had obtained a majority. The trial court entered judgment that &sect; 40:69A-160 required all seven candidates in such an election to receive a majority of the votes and a run-off election would be held. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that statutory provisions for avoidance of a run-off election did not apply to elections for seven councilmen. The court determined that to hold that so long as three attained a majority it was sufficient to declare the seven with the greatest number of votes elected would enable four to represent the people on the council, even though they may have received a relatively small vote.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a former state trooper, was injured during the course of his employment. He returned to work nine months later and was retired by the state the following year, after which time he received a disability pension. Prior to the date of his retirement, petitioner applied for workmen's compensation. Following a hearing, the hearing judge concluded that, although petitioner was totally disabled, he was only entitled to disability compensation for the period after returning to work following the accident. The county court agreed that petitioner was totally disabled but held that he was not entitled to compensation under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-43. Petitioner appealed the adverse judgment. In affirming, the court concluded that the status of petitioner at the time his claim for compensation was reviewed was relevant to his benefit determination. When the matter was presented for review, petitioner had ceased to be an employee and had become a pensioner. Where he was receiving pension benefits, he was not entitled to receive compensation benefits. To permit petitioner to receive these benefits would be improper because it would permit him to receive double benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that appellant was effectively precluded from inspecting the records in order to supply employers with the workmen's compensation histories of prospective employees. The court held that there was a conflict between the commercial enterprise, because of its potential to discourage hiring those previously disabled in industrial accidents, and the public policy encouraging the employment of the disabled. The court held that the ready availability of appellant's services at a nominal cost, encouraged by advertising, had a tendency offensive to public policy. Respondents had satisfied substantive due process, and the distinction between who might and who might not inspect the records was not invidious to the point of denying appellants equal protection.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:170-77.12 to 2A:170-77.14, was an improper exercise of the state police power in that it invaded an area reserved to the federal government, foreign commerce, under the federal supremacy clause of U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of New Jersey sought review in a case that pivoted on the constitutionality of the New Jersey Flagship Statute (NJFS), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:170-77.12 to 2A:170-77.14. The NJFS required tickets for passage on vessels to have the country of registry imprinted on them and imprinted on advertising material that pertained to passage, or the availability of passage, on any vessel for which such tickets were sold. The trial court ruled that the NJFS was unconstitutional. The state sought review. The court affirmed in favor of respondent companies. The court held that NJFS ran afoul of the commerce clause of U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and was properly held to be unconstitutional by the trial court for that reason. The court also held that the federal interest in regulating the subject matter at issue had a national scope and was dominant, and precluded any state regulation of that subject matter. Per the court, a uniform system of regulation was essential. The court found relevant the enactment of the Passenger Ship Safety Act of 1966, P.L. 89-777, that applied to vessels taking passengers at United States ports and that required disclosure regarding safety standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant successor inspector appealed from a judgment of the trial court (New Jersey), which ordered his ouster as building inspector of a second-class city, and restored plaintiff building inspector to that position.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governing body of a second-class city appointed plaintiff building inspector as building inspector. After plaintiff served in that capacity for three terms, the governing body appointed defendant successor inspector to the position. Plaintiff sued to recover his position, relying on N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:171-168 (1914), which provided that building inspectors in second-class cities were to hold office during good behavior and were not to be removed except for inefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming an employee, or other just cause, and then only after notice and a hearing. Defendant claimed that the statute violated N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 11 (1875), because it was a special law and had been passed according to the procedures applicable to the enactment of general laws. The court affirmed a judgment that ordered defendant's ouster from the position of building inspector, and plaintiff's reinstatement in that position. The legislature presumptively had a rational basis for providing tenure for building inspectors in second-class cities, but not in third-class or fourth-class cities, and the distinction did not render the statute unconstitutional as a special law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was taken to a police station for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and was given a breathalyzer test that showed a positive finding of alcohol. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the results of the test pursuant to R.R. 3:2A-6(a). The prosecution moved to dismiss, claiming that the county court was without jurisdiction because no illegal search and seizure was involved. The county judge denied the motion and ordered that testimony be heard, specifically with regard to the question of consent. The judge concluded that defendant had not consented to the test, as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50.1, the statute applicable at the time of the arrest. On appeal, the court noted that R.R. 3:2A-6(a) was available to any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure, whether the charge brought against him related to an indictable or nonindictable offense. The court held that the breathalyzer test constituted a &quot;search&quot; of defendant's person and, antecedently, depended upon a &quot;seizure&quot; of his person. The court affirmed the municipal court's determination that the test should be suppressed due to lack of consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the court below, holding that defendant's breathalyzer results were properly suppressed, as defendant had not consented to the test as required by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and $ 100 fine for the minor offense of careless driving under N.J. Rev. Stat. 39:4-97, arguing that his inculpatory statement to police was given involuntarily. Orally and in a signed statement made without counsel, defendant admitted causing a crash that killed a passenger in a car defendant was driving. At trial, defendant testified that another passenger was driving at the time. On appeal, the court held that the recently decided Miranda rule did not apply to minor misdemeanors such as the offense of careless driving. Not all offenses were criminal in nature, particularly motor vehicle violations that were tried quickly and by local police magistrates. Applying the Miranda rule to petty offenses would raise a host of practical problems entailing the expenditure of public resources. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision convicting defendant of careless driving, a minor traffic offense, and fining defendant $ 100. Defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings for such a petty offense and, therefore, his inculpatory uncounseled statement to police was admissible to prove that defendant was the driver of a car that crashed, killing a passenger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions of rape, kidnapping and atrocious assault and battery in the trial court, but did not consider the carrying a concealed weapon charge because the sentence was concurrent with the longer sentences. The Supreme Court (New Jersey) denied certification to defendant for want of merit and remanded reconsideration of the validity of the conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had affirmed defendant's convictions of rape, kidnapping and atrocious assault and battery in the trial court but, as to a conviction of carrying a concealed weapon, it found that because the charge was concurrent with the much longer terms imposed for the other charges, it was unnecessary to consider the conviction's validity. The Supreme Court denied certification for want of merit but remanded for reconsideration of the conviction's validity. The court examined the merits of the conviction. A gun was found in a jacket on the front seat of a car in which defendant and six others had been riding; the jacket was not his; he was in the back seat; he had left the car before the gun and jacket were found. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:151-7 provided that the presence of a firearm in a vehicle was presumptive evidence of possession by all persons occupying the vehicle at the time. The court reversed and found that it was an unconstitutional construction to have held that under the statute the mere unexplained presence of a gun concealed in a coat belonging to one passenger justified the conviction of another passenger of unlawful possession of a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As there was no evidence of possession, other than a statutory presumption that the court deemed to have been an unconstitutional construction, defendant's judgment of conviction on the indictment for carrying a concealed weapon was reversed. A judgment of acquittal as to that charge was entered. The mere unexplained presence of a gun concealed in a coat of a car's passenger had not justified defendant's conviction for unlawful possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, under N.J. Stat.

The officers, without obtaining an arrest warrant, went to defendant's apartment to arrest him. They observed narcotic paraphernalia in open view and a package containing heroin being thrown from the window. Defendant was charged with possession of the heroin and paraphernalia and with failing to register his change of address. The trial court found the search unlawful and suppressed the heroin and paraphernalia. The court held that defendant's arrest for a violation of &sect; 2A:169A-6 was illegal because it was a disorderly person's offense and the violation had not occurred in the officers' presence. The court found that the offense was the failure to have reported the address change, and that this had not occurred in the presence of the officers. The court held that the arrest had occurred before the officers entered the apartment and that all evidence obtained thereafter resulted from the unlawful arrest, and thus affirmed the trial court's suppression of that evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's suppression of the evidence, because the arrest of defendant for a disorderly person's offense that had not occurred in the presence of the arresting officers was illegal, and the evidence obtained as a result of that illegal arrest was the fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

In accordance with N.J. Stat.

Eventually, the court affirmed the trial court's order denying post-conviction relief and ordered reimbursement of the transcript cost. The prison eventually forwarded monies to the county treasurer, which had been withheld from defendant's earnings. Defendant moved to rescind the order.

The court allowed defendants, state teachers' association and national medical research group, to intervene as party defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two primary issues were whether the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:22-16(a) denied the board any power and discretion to permit high school students to undertake learning experiences involving ostensible pain or suffering of a chicken, and whether the board inflicted unnecessary cruelty or otherwise needlessly mutilated or killed live animals contrary to the provisions and intendment of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:22-26(a), (c). The animal rights group contended that no one but the state health department could give authority for conducting animal experiments and that the health department could grant authority for such experiments only to the entities named in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:22-16(a). The court found that because the board did not obtain authorization from the health department, an authorization which the health department did not think was needed, it was not thereby barred from performing living animal experimentation. The court concluded that the experiment at issue was not per se needless or unnecessary, and that such experiment did not fall within the ban of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:22-26 against needless mutilation or killing or the infliction of unnecessary cruelty.</SPAN></P>

The trial court read the statute to the jury, defined the terminology, and properly set forth the elements of the crime, but failed to relate those elements to the facts of the specific offense for which defendant had been indicted. The jury should have been instructed that the making of false statements alone would not support the charge laid in the indictment. In addition, the court held that the error was reversible because it affected substantial rights of defendant and had the capacity to bring about an unjust result. The court also stated that on remand, the trial court should refrain from expressing an opinion as to defendant's credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that none of them could be found guilty because the evidence failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Only one defendant was seen with cards in his hand. Others, some unidentified, were sitting around the table with cards and money on it while others were walking around the room. Defendants argued that the state was required to produce an eyewitness to prove that each defendant actually played for stakes. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the kind of proof which defendants maintained was necessary for conviction would have been extremely difficult to obtain, especially in view of the precautions taken by defendants. The court concluded that if such proof were required, the criminal law would be rendered impotent and that circumstantial evidence was quite sufficient. In this case, the circumstantial evidence included barred doors, a buzzer, a lookout station, a peep hole, the cards, the location, the hour, the observations of the police through a fan, the cry of &quot;cops,&quot; and the effort to escape. All the evidence indicated an illegal enterprise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of breaking and entering with the intent to steal. Defendant did not take the stand to testify in his own defense which was commented upon by both the prosecutor in his summation and the trial judge in his charge to the jury. Defendant appealed. The court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court found that subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court had held that such comments violated defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. V, as applied to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. For the purpose of providing guidance at the new trial the court held that certain evidence objected to by defendant was properly admitted. The failure to connect defendant specifically with these tools by direct rather than circumstantial evidence goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the pendency of the appeal of an action that set aside new assessments for local improvements to establish parking lots, plaintiffs property owners filed an action to compel defendant municipality to refund monies they paid on account of the assessments. The trial court denied the refund, finding that N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:56-34 applied. It held that defendant could reassess and could await the outcome of the pending appeal to do so. Plaintiffs sought review, asserting that they were entitled to a refund before a reassessment was made. The court considered the precursors of &sect; 40:56-34 and affirmed. It construed the statute to mean that where an assessment for benefits incident to a local improvement was set aside, but the improvement was actually made, defendant was obliged to make a reassessment and to refund the difference in assessments, if any. A full refund depended on a court finding no new assessment could be made. The deletion from the trial court's order of the provision directing a refund, negated plaintiffs' claim that defendant could not make a new assessment. It held defendant properly delayed reassessment until termination of the pending appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the application, holding that the requirement that the accused be entitled to representation by counsel did not carry with it by necessary implication the requirement that counsel be paid for his services, and the consequent obligation of the court to order such payment. There existed statutory authority to compensate counsel at public expense only in cases of murder. An award of compensation to assigned counsel could not be made except as authorized by statute or by rule. Every member of the bar of the state, when taking the oath upon admission to the bar, agreed to represent, without compensation, defendants in criminal cases when assigned by the court; an obligation so undertaken could not be said to constitute a deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law, nor to be a denial of the equal protection of the law. Since authority either by statute or rule was lacking, the court was powerless to award any compensation to counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating an ordinance that prohibited minors from using false identification to purchase alcoholic beverages. Defendant made three attempts to enter a tavern prior to his arrest. On each occasion, he was stopped by a police officer and asked to produce identification. Defendant initially advised the officer that he had no card, but eventually handed over two false identification cards. On appeal, defendant challenged the legality of the search and seizure, the constitutionality of the ordinance, and the sufficiency of the evidence. The court set aside the conviction. The court held that defendant waived any objection to the admission of the evidence based upon an alleged illegal search because he failed to comply with the requirements of R.R. 3:2A-6. The court found that the ordinance was constitutional and a proper exercise of municipal police power. The court determined, however, that the facts did not establish a violation of the ordinance. The court noted that defendant did not exhibit the false documents to establish his age. To the contrary, defendant attempted to gain entrance to the tavern without exhibiting the false documents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by a jury in the Hudson County Court (New Jersey) for failing to report a death and for moving the body of the dead person in violation of N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for failing to report a person's death, which was caused by narcotics use, and for wrongfully handling the decedent's body. The court reversed his conviction and held that the numerous occasions where the trial court participated in questioning defendant unfairly made it appear to the jury that the trial court did not believe defendant's testimony and therefore constituted reversible error. The court found that the trial court's failure to instruct the jury, both at the time the statement was admitted in evidence and upon the final charge to the jury, that a co-defendant's confession was not to be used as evidence against defendant constituted plain error under R.R. 1:5-1(a) that was harmful to defendant. The court remanded defendant's case for a new trial and held that the state's unwarranted inquiry into the sensitive collateral area of whether defendant had used narcotics, even after the trial court had ruled that defendant need not comply with the state's request to examine defendant's arm for needle marks, involved a high likelihood of prejudice and the state's unfair and prejudicial method constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial because the trial court committed reversible error by frequently participating in the interrogation of defendant. The state's unwarranted inquiry into the collateral area of defendant's denial of narcotics use involved capacity for prejudice, and the state unfairly implanted prejudice in the minds of the jury by re-emphasizing the imputation that defendant was lying.</SPAN></P>

The critical issue was the legal sufficiency of the indictments. Defendants contended that libel was not criminally punishable unless it tended to provoke a breach of the peace and that such an allegation was a necessary constituent element of a valid indictment. Upon interlocutory appeal, the court concluded that the impugned flyer published by defendants was not reasonably susceptible of the alleged defamatory import attributed to it by the State. It was not criminally actionable. The orders denying the motions to dismiss the indictments under review were reversed, and the matters were remanded to the county court for entry of judgments dismissing the indictments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant Board of Education of Teaneck Township (board) promulgated a plan to assign students to schools out of the neighborhood. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure of plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the present case presented constitutional issues which were judicial questions to be determined by the court and not by the commissioner of education. They claimed the plan was discriminatory and violated the equal protection clause of Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the constitutional question as to whether a local board of education could adopt a reasonable plan to resolve a de facto segregation situation had already been decided contrary to plaintiffs' position. The court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding the dismissal of the complaint to have been proper.

The ordinance referred only to materials and articles of commercial and business advertising matter and was never intended to prevent the lawful distribution and circulation of material containing an expression of a political nature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant zoning board challenged a judgment from a New Jersey trial court, which held that a funeral home was a permitted use in a suburban-business &quot;B&quot; district since it could be considered either a business office or the operation of a retail business under the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant zoning board challenged a trial court judgment in favor of respondent funeral home holding that a funeral home was a permitted use in a suburban-business &quot;B&quot; district since it could be considered either a business office or the operation of a retail business under the zoning ordinance. The court disagreed and reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the operation of a funeral home was the practice of mortuary science and did not fit into the classification as either a business office or operation of a retail business. A mortuary was a unique business that required special provisions to govern it. The court exercised its original jurisdiction under R.R. 1:5-4(a) and 2:5 to consider whether respondents should have been granted a use variance due to special reasons. The court found that appellant did not abuse its discretion in determining that the need for a Catholic mortuary in the area was not a special reason and was outweighed by the detrimental effect that the mortuary would have upon the surrounding residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for judgment in favor of appellant zoning board. The operation of a mortuary was not a permissible use under the ordinance and respondent funeral home failed to prove that a special reason existed to justify the grant of a use variance, particularly in light of the detrimental effect the mortuary would have upon the surrounding residents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant solicitor appealed the decision from the Passaic County Court (New Jersey), which affirmed the conviction by the municipal court for violation City of Clifton, N.J., Ordinance 24-30 requiring a permit for house-to-house soliciting in an action filed by plaintiff City of Clifton. Defendant contended that the ordinance infringed on the flow of interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of Clifton filed an action against defendant solicitor for failing to obtain a permit to solicit in violation of City of Clifton, N.J., Ordinance 24-30. Defendant was found in violation of the ordinance in municipal court, and the trial court affirmed. The appellate court also affirmed, rejecting defendant's contention that the ordinance infringed on interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. A municipality had the authority to regulate solicitors in the legitimate exercise of its police powers as long as it did not create an undue burden. Licensing served the legitimate purpose of insuring that home solicitors were reputable. There was no evidence that the cumulative effect of complying with this and other ordinances placed an undue burden on commerce or on defendant. The waiting period was necessary so that authorities could investigate a solicitor's background. Ordinances bore a presumption of validity, and defendant could not overcome the presumption where he failed to show injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The affirmation of the conviction of defendant solicitor for failing to obtain a license was affirmed. Plaintiff City of Clifton's ordinance requiring the license was not an infringement on the Commerce Cause because it served the legitimate purpose of policing solicitors and protecting residents and was not an undue burden on commerce or defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court determined that 45-day period to appellant's right to review began running from the publication of the notice of the granting to tentative approval. The court found no diligence in appellant's efforts to secure relief or any other reason why the interests of justice would require a waiver of the limitations bar. The court concluded that appellant, who based his standing on his status as a taxpayer and property owner, did not show that he was aggrieved by the alleged denial of constitutional rights and therefore had no right to appeal. The court held that neither the cluster zoning ordinance nor its application to respondent corporation and other land developers was discriminatory or violative of equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commissioner challenged the decision from the Superior Court (New Jersey), which entered a judgment in favor of appellee rival politician following a contested election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commissioner was elected over appellee rival politician. Appellee petitioned the trial court to annul the election pursuant to the absentee voting law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:57-1 et seq. Appellee contended that certain absentee ballots were void because another candidate notarized them. The trial court annulled the election. The appellate court reversed. The certification on the flap of the ballot, required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:57-17, could be notarized by a person whose name appeared on the ballot, if that person was properly registered as a notary. This procedure would not invalidate absentee votes cast for appellant. The analogy drawn to district boards of election was faulty. Those boards had much greater authority than the certifying officer under the absentee voting law. There was less of a chance of undue influence upon the voter in the absentee ballot procedure. If the legislature had wanted to ban the practice it could have passed a law to that effect. This was further supported by the rule that the absentee voting law should be liberally construed, and elections should not be overturned for technical violations.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged the order pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:1-34 and filed a petition for declaratory judgment pursuant to R.R. 4:88-8, that the order was illegal. In response to an Attorney General complaint on behalf of appellee, appellants were restrained from issuing or distributing the coupons. On appeal of that order and in determining appellant's initial challenges, the court found that Regulation H-5 of the office of milk industry prohibited a licensee from giving or lending anything of value to any customer in the sale or solicitation of milk products. The court found that although the coupons contained conditions and an expiration date, they constituted something of value.

Instead, defendant distributed all of decedent's assets, including those in the deposit account, in accordance with the instructions in the will. Plaintiff filed an action against defendant, seeking to establish that he was entitled to the proceeds of the deposit account. Defendant claimed that he had fairly relied on old law that had held that the opening of a deposit account in trust for another was not conclusive of an intent to make an absolute gift. The county court granted summary judgment for plaintiff, and the court affirmed, finding that defendant had an obligation to ask for instructions where he had doubt about his duties and obligations.

The court also dismissed the complaint against the corporation because the classification by which the corporation's premises was brought within the Law Against Discrimination (law), N.J. Stat.

The court held that the law was unconstitutional to the extent of the exceptions because the method chosen to change the community-wide practice by which white and black families did not dwell under the same roof was unfair. The law was enacted for the protection of the public safety and to promote the general welfare and guarantee of civil rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted backing up his car on the parkway, but challenged his conviction contending that art. 1.1.3 was unenforceable because it was an improper delegation of the legislature's authority. In the de novo appeal, the court found that the legislature had the constitutional power to delegate to the New Jersey Highway Authority (authority) the power to enact and enforce regulations for the use of the parkway. Reviewing the enabling legislation, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:12B-18 clearly showed that the rule-making power of the authority was well circumscribed by definitive standards to guide the authority and, thus, satisfied all constitutional requirements. Defendant also argued that the regulation was not posted to give notice to the travelling public as required by law. Interpreting the requirement of &quot;appropriate signs erected at the roadside or otherwise posted&quot; as a duty to inform the public of the regulations, the court found that the authority complied with &sect; 27:12B-18(g) by making the regulations readily available. Accordingly, the court found defendant guilty as charged and imposed a fine plus costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant importer and distributor of alcoholic beverages and appellee sole distributor had a contract where appellant appointed appellee as its primary distributor. After appellee sole distributor was unable to make any commitment for additional purchases, appellant terminated the prime distributorship. Appellee sole distributor then filed a petition with appellee Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (division) pursuant to N.J. Stat.

Appellee division required appellant to sell and continue to sell to appellee sole distributor alcoholic beverages on terms usually and normally required by appellant. Appellant challenged the order, and the court remanded the matter back to appellee division and retained jurisdiction. The court held that a prime distributorship was not a per se violation of the statute and the taking away of a prime distributorship was not necessarily improper. The court determined that appellant's actions would not have been contrary to the statute provided appellant showed that the action taken was reasonable and was a proper and legitimate business decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Camden County Court (New Jersey) for unlawfully placing a child for adoption and receiving money in violation of N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for unlawfully placing a child for adoption and receiving money in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:96-7. The incident involved defendant paying a mother who just had a baby, and the mother and father thereafter wanted the baby returned because they missed it. Initially, defendant refused to return the baby contending it had been adopted, but the mother consulted an attorney and eventually received her baby back. Defendant appealed his conviction contending that &sect; 2A:96-7 was unconstitutional, that New Jersey lacked jurisdiction to try him, that his motions for judgment of acquittal should have been granted, that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and that error was committed in the trial judge's charge in failing to charge that proof of criminal intent was necessary under the statute. The court affirmed defendant's conviction finding that scienter was not a requirement of &sect; 2A:96-7, and that although defendant might possible have been unaware that his actions were in violation of the law, he certainly knew that he was taking steps to procure an adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for unlawfully placing a child for adoption and receiving money was affirmed because scienter was not a necessary element of the offense, and the trial court judge did not err in failing to charge the jury that criminal intent was required to be convicted of unlawfully placing a child for adoption and receiving money.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the suspension of appellant's bingo licenses because the court found that respondent's action was reasonable and legally grounded. The court concluded that respondent, upon the facts presented before it, could have legitimately inferred that the reports submitted by appellant for the weekly games held in January and February 1961 before the first audit, were false. The court also stated that it recognized respondent's expertise in the field of legalized games of chance. Lastly, the court stated that there needed to be no resort to any presumption to support the clear inference that appellant's reports for the weekly games in January and February were false, because the reports it filed after the first audit revealed a substantial and unexplained increase in the per player average for the sale of extra boards and for total receipts.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the &quot;charitable immunity statute,&quot; under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:53A-7 to 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured individual and her husband, brought an action against defendant church after plaintiff injured individual fell on the church steps while she was there for religious purposes. Defendant's asserted its freedom from negligence and alleged as a separate defense that defendant was a non-profit corporation, organized exclusively for religious purposes and as such was immune from actions for negligence. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by the &quot;charitable immunity statute,&quot; N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:53A-7. The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion to strike the separate defense pleaded by defendant and granted defendant's motion for a summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Immunity from suit granted to a church did not constitute an interference with the free practice of religion by a person who attended the church. Also, the legislation granting the immunity was not a law respecting the establishment of religion, in contravention of the provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The creation and granting of charitable immunity was within the province of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute allowed respondent to revise a taxpayer's inventory asset valuations for franchise tax purposes. Petitioner also challenged the action of respondent in readjusting reserves for doubtful accounts. The court held that respondent's readjustment reflected a fair value based on recent actual write-offs. Petitioner also challenged the right of respondent to reflect a deduction from net worth of the aggregate of the value of its stock of a debt by a wholly owned subsidiary. The court held that the plain statutory language of the provision in question made it clear that legislative intent was not to allow such write-offs.

The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that a reasonable interpretation of the statute as revealed by the composite thrust of the whole statute indicated that it was intended to be applied also to preparation activities. The court also held that the statement that the public will take shelter was a clear-cut directive. The court found that beliefs were inviolate, but the regulation of speech and religion was apt when the incidental limitation of personal freedoms were justified by the overriding public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statutes were reasonably appropriate in their overall approach mandating state-approved agency participation in adoptions, and thus they should be upheld notwithstanding that they might be invalid in their applications in special circumstances or fringe areas.

The court held that in determining whether materials were legally obscene, the test to be applied was whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interests; and finally that such test must be applied to the materials themselves, and not by measuring the effect that the materials may have on any given person or group of persons. The court concluded that after reviewing the various materials, that none of them met the legal definition of obscenity, because they did not appeal to the prudent interest of sex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The position of collector of taxes had existed in Jersey City since 1871. In 1961, Jersey City adopted the Mayor-Council Plan C form of government. Appellant mayor and director of finance issued a letter of termination informing respondent collector of taxes that his position had terminated. The present action was initiated by complaint in lieu of prerogative writs, sought judgment directing appellants to rescind the purported termination letter and to permit respondent to continue in office. The trial court held that the letter of termination was void and the new form of government did not abolish respondent's position. Appellant sought review to determine whether respondent was entitled to remain in his position when the Faulkner Act plan went into effect. The court agreed with the trial court and held that respondent was still the collector of taxes in Jersey City. The court found that the collector of taxes was a statutory office and was for a fixed term of four years, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:46-6.1 and N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11:28-2.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.J. Stat.

After significant litigation, the trial court set compensation for the condemned property at $ 57,623.93. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that the denial of defendant intervenor's application for intervention by the trial court was not prejudicial error such as to justify a reversal because although defendant intervenor's small interest in the property was significant enough to warrant intervention, defendant intervenor, brother to defendant landowner, sat in on all the hearings and participated in the defense. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusions as to compensation. The court also found that failure of the state to acquire defendants' property within the time frame provided by the statute did not void the condemnation proceedings because the deadline was extended by six months by act of the legislature, and although the extension did not take effect until 11 days after the deadline, the legislature did not intend to void existing litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction for failing to pay a federal tax on the possession and transfer of marijuana was outside the scope of &sect; 24:18-47(b) because the Harrison Anti-Narcotics Act was a revenue law rather than a narcotics law. The court disagreed, citing case law from another jurisdiction, which found little merit to the argument. Noting that the enhanced narcotics offender provision was adopted by the state legislature long after the Harrison Act was held constitutional as a revenue measure, the court concluded that the state legislature intended to include a violation of the Harrison Act by its reference to federal laws relating to narcotic drugs. Although defendant's prior convictions both occurred before the New Jersey Uniform Narcotic Drug Law was adopted, the court held that the increased penalty provision was not an ex post facto law because defendant was being punished for the third and latest offense. Accordingly, the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the accusation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the lower court did not give sufficient weight to the evidence of sales of nearby land for residential or other urban development. The court ordered that on remand, the lower court should carefully consider the availability of the land for a residential development or other urban use, and determine other factors, such as how close the sewer and water utilities were available to the property, the topography of the farm, and whether it was level and well drained for streets and underground utilities.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that appellant failed to file a motion to suppress the seized evidence and did not object to its admission at his trial. While the decision of the Supreme Court for the first time enforced the exclusionary rule against the states, the constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures did not necessarily retroactively apply to appellant's case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While plaintiff's action for breach of contract was pending against defendant corporation, plaintiff filed a separate action to set aside allegedly fraudulent conveyances from defendant corporation to defendant individual.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgement of the trial court (New Jersey), which convicted him of driving 37 miles per hour in a residence district that had a speed limit of 25 miles per hour in violation of N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant admitted that he drove 37 miles per hour, he was convicted of speeding in a residence district with a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-98. He appealed on the ground that he was not in a residence district. Defendant contended that the 600 feet that was required to define a residence district under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:1-1 (1951), must have been 600 feet travelled by him within which he was alleged to have exceeded the speed limit. Defendant also alleged that &sect; 39:1-1 was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite because it was unclear where to begin the 600 feet and that it placed an undue burden and hardship on the motorist. The court affirmed the conviction and held that because defendant entered a residence district and drove 37 miles per hour therein for even a short distance, he was guilty as charged. The court saw no merit in defendant's constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction in the trial court for speeding because the statute did not require defendant to travel the entire 600 feet of the residence district but only required him to enter the residence district and exceed the speed limit for a short distance therein to be guilty as charged.</SPAN></P>

On appeal to the trial court, there was a trial de novo based upon the stenographic record of the municipal court proceedings. Upon full review of the record, the trial judge found the ordinance invalid and set aside defendant's conviction. The court dismissed the state's appeal, holding that the judgment of acquittal was not appealable under controlling case law and the court was precluded from considering the merits of the substantive issues involved. The court found that as the trial court's review of the action was de novo, not appellate, the principles of double jeopardy applied to an acquittal based upon the invalidity of an ordinance. The court determined that defendant had been subject to a quasi-criminal proceeding in which the original judgment of the municipal court had been nullified.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it must apply only those statutes benefiting the dependent widow that were in effect at the time of employment, notwithstanding the fact that the widow's cause of action did not accrue until after the statutory amendment and the death of the employee. The court found that application of any law that changed the terms of the compensation obligations and was declared to be effective on a date subsequent to the date of last employment impaired the obligation of the employment contract in violation of N.J.

At the third meeting, defendant used a loudspeaker and was arrested. The county revoked the permit for the fourth date based on the violation but defendant proceeded to hold the fourth meeting. Defendant was convicted for use of the sound equipment and for holding a meeting without a permit, in violation of a municipal ordinance that prohibited use of the park in a manner not authorized by the park commission. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it did not contain standards to guide the park commission in issuance of permissions, but instead vested the park commission with limitless discretion. The court found that the ordinance violated the right to free speech, assembly, and worship guaranteed by the U. S. Const. amend. I, and amend.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant's expert witness was well qualified to testify. Specifically, the court noted defendant's expert's 30 years' experience as a real estate appraiser, appraising and testifying regarding thousands of pieces of property for the government and private parties; his other appraisals in the immediate area, including the 50-foot easement taken by another utility on defendant's property; and his familiarity with the physical characteristics, location, and zoning of the property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment for defendant. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the exception made in favor of new car dealers by the 1957 amendment to paragraph 12, did not vitiate the overriding intention of the local legislative body to prohibit used car lots. The court held that plaintiff had not overcome the presumption that the township committee intended the ordinance to be severable as to any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase.

A provision in Bloomfield, N.J., Fire Ordinance art. 15, &sect; 2(p) (1938), permitted the imposition of the fine. Plaintiffs demanded a judgment declaring that the provisions of the ordinance were unreasonable, illegal, unconstitutional, and void. The trial court found that the allegations in the complaint were not sufficient, under R.R. 4:36 to make it a class action and that the allegations did not present a justiciable controversy ripe for judicial determination. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint seeking declaratory judgment because the trial court was not faced with a specific set of facts. Plaintiffs, the union president and its secretary, did not challenge the fines and the union members were not facing charges, written or otherwise.

Ann. &sect; 2A:171-5.8 et seq. The lower court entered convictions against them and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the Law did not deny the free exercise of religion and that it did not offend the ban against church-state union. The court further held that the classifications of articles which were and were not saleable on Sunday was not discriminatory, and that such decisions were properly determined by the legislature absent a showing that they were plainly capricious. Lastly, the court determined that the increase in punishment with each further offense did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that the principle of imposing greater penalties for subsequent offenses was used in many different statutes and was not unconstitutional. Accordingly, the court affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed that decision and remanded the case, finding that the trial judge had overstepped the bounds of his authority, and that his actions were prejudicial to defendants. In effect, he took on the role of advocate, his activities extending from investigation and preparation to the actual presentation of testimony and exhibits at the trial, and he converted the action into what amounted to a municipal investigation. The court concluded that the ordinance was valid and that plaintiff had no standing to attack the contract, and that plaintiff was barred by R.R. 4:88-15(a) from questioning the validity of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a member of the Orthodox Jewish faith, observed Saturday as the Sabbath. On his appeal of his conviction for selling carpeting on Sunday, defendant contended that Chapter 119 of the Laws of 1959, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:171-5.8 et seq., violated U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4, 5 and put him at a competitive disadvantage. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court construed the statute as a legitimate legislative exercise of the police power, and weighed its incidental hardship on religion against the requirements of the general health, safety, morals, and welfare of the community. The court held that the statute was free of any constitutional infirmity in relation to freedom of religion. The court stated that the &quot;free&quot; exercise of religion did not logically carry with it the proposition that the members of a sect should not be called upon to make some financial sacrifice in its behalf. &quot;Free&quot; as used in the federal and state constitutions was not synonymous with &quot;at no cost,&quot; but rather signified an absence of government restriction or interference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidates filed nomination petitions for the office of county committeeman. After defendant candidates filed their petitions the next day, plaintiffs filed written objections to defendants' nominations with the city clerk.

The city clerk overruled plaintiffs' objections. Plaintiffs then instituted an action in the trial court, seeking a reversal of the city clerk's determination. The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, and defendants sought review of the order. The court reversed the judgment and held that it was not a qualification for candidacy in a primary election that the nominee must have voted at the last general election. The court found that neither N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:23-7 or &sect; 19:23-15 contained any requirement that a candidate must have voted at the last general election in order to be nominated.

The court affirmed the administrative officials' approval of the bond issue and rejected appellants' argument that &sect; 18:5-56 unconstitutionally interposed an alien will between the legislature and the people. The court held that the fact finding functions were appropriate and were not a matter of pure discretion and that, in light of the whole statute, general phrases such as &quot;materially impair&quot; and &quot;trends&quot; were not insufficient standards. Although there were no written findings of fact, the court found that the estimates upon which the agencies' decisions were made were adequate because &sect; 18:5-56 did not required findings of fact.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union appealed from an interlocutory injunction granted by the trial court (New Jersey), enjoining defendant and named individual officers and agents thereof, as well as all persons and organizations associated with or acting in concert or combination with them, from certain specified activities at or near the entrances to plaintiff employer's plant and regulating and restricting picketing by them related to an existing strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered an interlocutory injunction enjoining defendant union and others from certain specified activities at or near the entrances to plaintiff employer's plant and regulating and restricting picketing by them related to an existing strike. On appeal, defendants contended the evidence did not show them guilty of conduct fairly beyond the lawful scope of the economic and psychological pressure a striking union might apply to win a strike. The court held that defendants' behavior afforded a substantive basis for injunctive relief, but the injunction must be reversed for serious nonconformance with procedural requirements of the Anti-Injunction Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:15-51 to 58. The restraint was provisional, gave defendants notice of plenary hearings, and should have been retained no longer than was necessary to develop the facts as to illegality of the picketing and other matters on the hearings and to make appropriate findings. Instead the restraint remained in effect almost six weeks after the conclusion of the hearings before findings of any kind were made, and almost two months before the injunction was entered on the findings. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the injunction granted to plaintiff employer because of serious nonconformance with procedural requirements of the Anti-Injunction Act. The long period of the restraint constituted failure promptly after the hearings either to vacate the restraint or to take the statutory steps prerequisite to its continuance. This was a substantial violation of defendant union's rights, and the extent of the delay warranted reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trailer was registered in North Carolina for 17,000 pounds.

Defendant's tractor was register in New Jersey for 13,000 pounds. When police stopped the tractor-trailer, the operator produced the registrations, but the actual weighing by the state police showed that the vehicle and its load weighed 45,900 pounds exceeding its legal gross registered weight by 15,900 pounds. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-84.3 prohibited the operation on any highway in New Jersey of a tractor-trailer with a gross weight in excess of the 60,000 pounds or that permitted by its certificate of registration, whichever was lower. On appeal of its conviction, the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 39:3-84.3 applied only to combinations of vehicles wholly registered in New Jersey because such an interpretation would defeat the purpose of the statute.

Plaintiffs claimed that the housing at issue was not publicly assisted housing and that the action against plaintiff corporate officers was time-barred. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' suit for lack of jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On its own motion, the court considered the merits of plaintiffs' suit. In light of the Federal Housing Authority's commitment to insure mortgages for housing, plaintiffs' claim that the housing was not publicly assisted within the meaning of N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent incompetent's property was sold to appellant purchaser subject to prior liens pursuant to a foreclosure sale for unpaid hospital maintenance charges under N.J.

An order was entered appointing a guardian but the appointee was not advised of the appointment until after the sale, and he filed a report that he was unable to protect respondent's interests. A substitute guardian was then granted an invalidation of the sale, and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed to the extent that it set aside the sale but ordered appellant reimbursed for its payments in discharge of the prior liens. The court found that the price was not so inadequate as to warrant setting aside the sale, that the statutory lien constituted a judgment upon which execution could issue under N.J. Stat.

The court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional on its face because it penalized the possession or uttering of a contraceptive device &quot;without just cause.&quot; The court determined that the language &quot;without just cause&quot; was vague and indefinite and, as such, did not fairly apprise prospective defendants of the elements constituting a quasi-criminal infraction. The court ruled that the statute was an unconstitutional enactment under both the New Jersey and the United State constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer, charged with leaving his duty and with disobeying orders, was dismissed from his position by defendants, mayor and township. Plaintiff brought an action to set aside the order of dismissal on the grounds that the proceedings were illegal, arbitrary, unconstitutional, and void. The superior court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and held that plaintiff should have appealed to the county court under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:47-10. Plaintiff contended that he did not have to comply with &sect; 40:47-10. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the superior court's decision, holding that the superior court should have transferred the matter to the county court and not dismissed it. The court stated that exhaustion of other administrative remedies was a rule of convenience and not an indispensable precondition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners' property occupied an area zoned for residential use. Appellants instituted an action against respondent township alleging that its zoning ordinance unconstitutionally discriminated in restricting them to such use that prohibited them from developing a trailer park. The trial court found in favor of respondent and appellants sought review, asserting respondent's refusal to include their property in rezoning to industrial constituted discrimination. The court considered whether it should declare that appellants had a right to use their land as a trailer park, free of the inhibitions of the ordinance. The basis for such a result would be the right to be free of the restrictions of an ordinance, which operated capriciously and discriminatorily on appellants' property. The ordinance was presumptively valid and not to be set aside judicially absent a clear showing that it was unreasonable. The mere fact that appellants' property bordered property now zoned industrial did not of itself equate discrimination. It was not totally unreasonable for respondent to retain the zoning use district classification as it stood; thus, the court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conduct was clearly in violation of the statute, the purpose of which was to provide a day of rest and escape from the marketplace for seller and customer alike. Defendant's work did not fall into the &quot;necessity&quot; exception of the statute because it was not a required part of the sale of real estate that model homes remain open for inspection on Sundays. However, defendant's conviction had to be set aside because the town failed to negative in its complaint the exceptions of necessity or charity in the enacting clause; the burden of proof was on the town to show that defendant's work did not fall into one of these exceptions, and the town failed to introduce any such proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was confined in a state prison under a life sentence as a habitual criminal. He filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the county court that had imposed the life sentence. In a second county court, he filed a motion for a writ of error coram nobis. The object of both proceedings was to vacate one of the convictions upon which the habitual criminal charge and life sentence were grounded. Both writs were denied. The court consolidated the appeals and affirmed. The court held that habeas corpus was not an available remedy for appellant to attack the underlying conviction on the ground that the county court in which such conviction took place had no jurisdiction to try or convict him. The court concluded that the writ of error coram nobis was obsolete in New Jersey. The available remedy was by motion to vacate a prior conviction. Treating appellant's motion as such, the court concluded that it was properly denied without a hearing because there was no sufficient showing of a denial of fundamental fairness, which was shocking to the universal sense of justice, that required relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed as a salesperson by an out-of-state corporation and was hired to canvass and solicit bona fide orders for landscaping and for fruit and plant materials on behalf of his employer. Defendant's job consisted of contacting home and farm owners directly and of soliciting from door to door. Once an order was placed, shipment and payment was directly between the customer and the employer. Defendant contended that he was an independent salesperson engaged in interstate commerce and that each transaction was a form of transaction in interstate commerce. The court noted that under the ordinance, anyone who wanted to solicit in the town had to first register with the chief of police. Defendant had failed to register. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the ordinance did not constitute a burden on interstate commerce. The court concluded that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the police power, where it merely required the obtaining of a permit and the payment of a nominal fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city filed condemnation proceedings against appellant landowners, seeking to condemn their adjacent parcels for a parking lot. After the trial court set awards for both parcels, appellee abandoned the proceedings pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20:1-30. The trial court awarded costs to each appellant, which the court affirmed. The court held that the statute did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V or N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 because it did not sanction a taking without just compensation. Under common law, there was no provision for payment of attorney fees or costs to a party who defended a condemnation proceeding that was subsequently abandoned by a governmental authority, absent statutory authority. Although a party incurred costs in defending the action, no wrong was done; thus, it was found to be a matter of damnum absque injuria. The statute sought to afford the parties relief from the burden that was necessarily imposed. The court held that the statute gave the trial court discretion to determine an award of reasonable costs, but it did not impose a duty to award all costs. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the award of costs.</SPAN></P>

The beneficiaries of the trust argued that the whole of the residuary estate of the decedent was to have been made available for the payment of federal estate taxes prior to the division of one-half to the surviving spouse and one-half to the trusts. The court found in favor of the surviving spouse. The court held that in the absence of a mandatory directive in the will, the surviving spouse's share of a residuary estate should not have been required to contribute proportionately to the payment of federal estate taxes when such share qualified for the marital deduction.

The court applied a two-part test to the case. The court stated that there was no basis for the appeals court, and there was none for the court, to find the existence either prior or after October 1, 1953, of any particular commonly applied standard of value for the assessment of property in respondent.

The court reversed the order that granted plaintiff a refund and that reduced its tax assessment. The court held that any other suit brought by other taxpayers that contested defendant's method of increasing their tax assessments, and the decision therefrom that reduced the assessments on those taxpayer's property, was not applicable to plaintiff. The court observed that the language of that decision clearly limited its relief to the parties that instituted that suit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, who were arrested for illegal bookmaking, filed actions in a chancery court for replevin and trespass and sought the return of the evidence on which appellees, Attorney General and prosecutor, relied to convict them. Appellees acknowledged that the evidence was obtained through an illegal search, but cited to the rule that the fruits of the illegal search were admissible if relevant to the prosecution. The chancery court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. The court considered carefully and at length the existing jurisprudence about the exclusionary rule. The U.S. Supreme Court had allowed the states to decide whether the fruits of an illegal search could be suppressed. The court concluded that New Jersey should join those states that had adopted the exclusionary rule. However, as an intermediate court, it could not make such a ruling absent a holding from the New Jersey Supreme Court, which in its most recent opinion had remained unconvinced that the rule of admissibility should be abandoned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, chamber of commerce and businessmen, filed an action to prevent defendants, housing authority and local governing boards, from proceeding with a new low income housing project. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the decision and found that the affidavits submitted by plaintiffs on the motion for summary judgment failed to establish that either the manor in which defendants proceeded or the decision to initiate the project and to locate it in a non-slum area constituted a palpable abuse of discretion. On a motion by plaintiffs invoking the court's original jurisdiction, the court found that projects by defendant housing authority were subject to local zoning ordinances, and although defendant housing authority had an agreement which required the local government to amend the zoning ordinance for low rent housing projects, resolutions by defendant local governing boards that expressed approval of the project did not affect a zoning amendment or variance. The court also found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:14A-7, which granted defendant housing authority its power, was not unconstitutional for lack of standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public utility board ordered appellant railroad to reconstruct a county highway bridge over its railroad tracks without financial assistance from respondent state. Appellant challenged the public utility board's order, contending that it was entitled to 85 percent financial assistance from respondent under 1947 N.J. Laws ch. 178, which applied to all reconstructions regardless of whether they were at grade or affected a public highway. Alternatively, appellant claimed that it was unconstitutional to assess it with 100 percent of the reconstruction costs on project that did not benefit appellant. The court affirmed the public utility board's order, concluding that ch. 178 did not apply to all reconstruction projects, whether at grade or crossing. Moreover, the imposition of total costs on appellant was constitutional because respondent state acted pursuant to its police power for the protection of local safety, convenience, and necessity. The court declined to address the dates of completion set by the public utility board, holding that the matter was best left to the public utility board's discretion.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, owners of hotels in the state of New Jersey, contended that the regulations were invalid because they were contrary to the statutory exemption of employment in a hotel. The court held that Mandatory Order Nos. 9 and 10 were invalid. The Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-34 et seq., unequivocally and unqualifiedly exempted employment in a hotel, from the minimum wage laws. The duty of the administrative agency, therefore, was to exclude all employment in a hotel from inclusion under the minimum wage standards, at least to the extent of operations not beyond what may be regarded as customary or reasonably incidental to the conduct of the hotel business. The court concluded that defendant, insofar as his wage order purported to include hotels, exercised a legislative and not an administrative function, and his action was ultra vires.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landlord's tenant borrowed money from plaintiff creditor, which was secured by a chattel mortgage on the tenant's commercial machinery. Plaintiff foreclosed on the mortgage after the tenant defaulted on the loan, and the machinery was sold at a foreclosure sale. Defendant asserted a lien against the proceeds of the sale under N.J. Stat. &sect; 2A:44-166, which provided for a priority lien for unpaid rent on the tenant's machinery. Plaintiff filed an action against defendant to determine the parties' respective rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment entered in favor of defendant and held that &sect; 2A:44-166 was constitutional. The court found that the statute was presumptively constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; I and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; I, and that plaintiff failed to rebut the presumption. The court determined that plaintiff was presumed to have had knowledge of &sect; 2A:44-166 at the time the chattel mortgage was executed, and could have protected itself by requiring the production of monthly rent receipts by the tenant.

Defendant then filed more writs of habeas corpus stating a hearing was required and that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment under N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which denied defendant's writ and the court held that defendant was not entitled to a hearing on the correction of the clerical error because the transcript attached to the record was accurate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, commissioner of labor and industry, issued mandatory minimum fair wage standards which affected women and minors employed in the laundry, cleaning, and dyeing businesses. Petitioner employers, engaged in those businesses, sought a declaratory judgment setting aside the order as to overtime wage rates. The court held respondent had the authority to set overtime rates pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-47. The court found the Minimum Wage Act guided respondent's establishment of an overtime rate by providing safeguards for minimum rates. Respondent was obligated to secure for the employee the minimum fair and reasonable value of the services rendered and a minimum living wage. The court found that an overtime rate properly constituted a supplementary safeguard of the minimum fair because it commonly entered into the fixing of the minimum fair and reasonable value of services. The court found that respondent's longstanding interpretation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-47 was some evidence that the order complied with the statute. The court held respondent's power to render a violation of the statute a criminal offense was a valid delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that respondent, the Division of Tax Appeals, Department of Treasury (division), so conducted the proceedings regarding the assessments that respondent was denied due process.

The court held that a panel of two members of respondent division conducted the hearing regarding appellant's assessments and made a report to all members of respondent. The court held that this process was in accordance with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:2-18. The court held that if it was constitutional for the legislature to empower a panel to make a decision for respondent then it was constitutional to empower respondent to make the decision on the basis merely of a study of a panel's recommendation, including a report on the particulars of the evidence. The court held that under &sect; 54:2-18, the panel was authorized to advise as well as to report.

The trial court agreed with defendant and found that the claim was barred by the act. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, and held that the legislature effectively ordained under the act that money damages could not be recovered by the father of an adult girl who had abandoned her virtue and become pregnant. The act provided that the rights of action that existed at common law to recover sums of money as damage for the alienation of affections, criminal conversation, seduction, or breach of contract to marry were abolished.

The court reversed and rejected the state's contention that the gross weight provisions of the statute applied to the out-of-state vehicles. The court noted that the weakness in the state's contention was that the New York statute relied upon by the state applied only to vehicles registered in New York, and that there was no New Jersey statute that permitted authorities to use an &quot;allowable weight&quot; in the determination of a violation of the state statute where the &quot;allowable weight&quot; was based on the statute of a sister state.

Defendant contended that the ordinance offended due process by being too vague and that the state failed to prove that the noise was unnecessary. The court disagreed. Although the ordinance was criminal in nature and thus subject to a charge of vagueness, the court concluded that it was not vague. Looking at the entirety of the language, at precedents concerning the concept of preservation of the peace, and at the meaning of the language in general parlance, the ordinance was sufficient to define a penal offense and to apprise defendant of what it proscribed. The answer to the question of whether the noise was unnecessary was within the peculiar knowledge of defendant. Therefore, this element of proof was an exception to the general rule that the burden of proof rested with the state. Defendant chose not give any evidence on this point.

The trial court held all of the ordinance valid except for &sect; 16, which regulated street vendors, and, because &sect; 16 was invalid, ordered defendant to issue vendor's permits. The court reversed and held that the entire ordinance was invalid because too many parts of it conflicted with &sect; 45:24-9 et seq., which governed plaintiffs' right to vend in public. The court found that the ordinance was adopted under the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:24-9 (amended 1950), not pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:52-1(c), which empowered a governing body to make and enforce ordinances to license and regulate street vendors. The court ruled that &sect; 45:24-9 did not give defendant the right to both regulate and license plaintiffs, but did set out a comprehensive licensing procedure for it to follow in regulating plaintiffs' activities and therefore the intent of &sect; 45:24-9 was to preempt the field of licensing plaintiffs' activities.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 43:21-19, which defined employer, was unconstitutional. On appeal the court affirmed and held that &sect; 43:21-19 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV equal protection guarantees. The statute, which ignored corporate ownership when defining an employment unit, was found to be applied equally to all similarly situated companies and was aimed at preventing companies from avoiding contributions to the fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry and held that appellant holding company was required to pay into the unemployment compensation fund because it was an employing unit when considered in conjunction with its operating unit. The statute defining employment unit was held to be constitutional because it was applied equally to all similarly situated companies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant scavenger contractor was the low bidder on a contract let by appellant village for the exclusive privilege of collecting and disposing of garbage. Respondent waste contractor, low bidder the previous 10 years, filed an action to declare invalid the ordinance under which the contract was bid. The lower court determined the ordinance was invalid because the language of the statute did not make it mandatory for appellant village to award the contract to the low bidder. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the use of the word &quot;may&quot; in the ordinance did make it invalid. Appellant village correctly proceeded under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:50-1 and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:66-4 by putting the contract up for public bid. The use of the word &quot;may&quot; in the ordinance was such that if the village advertised for bids it could only award the contract to the lowest bidder. Such a liberal construction was mandated under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:42-4 and N.J. Const., art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 11.

The court upheld the franchise tax assessment, rejecting appellant's argument that it was unconstitutional in that it was in actuality a personal property tax designed unlawfully to tax the bonds and other obligations of the United States. Writing that there was no doubt that the state had the power to impose the franchise tax upon a corporation, it found that the diction, limited applicability, formulae, and indeed all of the ostensible features of the statute revealed the practical nature of the tax to be that of a franchise tax, a privilege tax payable by domestic and foreign corporations conducting business within New Jersey. It concluded that it was well settled by the United States Supreme Court that a state had the power to levy a tax on a legitimate subject, such as a corporate franchise, measured by net assets or net income including tax-exempt federal instrumentalities which, as such, could not be directly taxed.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, board and city, filed a motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, claiming that respondents had not exhausted their administrative remedies under R.R. 4:88-14. The lower court denied appellants' motions, holding that the interests of justice required initial resort to the courts because neither the county nor state tax boards had the authority to remedy discriminatory assessments where doing so would reduce such assessments below the true value of the property. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that initial resort to the courts was required based on the limited authority of appellant board, which only the legislature could expand. However, the court disapproved of the rule that where a taxpayer's property was assessed at true value, the fact that other taxpayers were not so assessed provided grounds for an increase and not a reduction based on discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant's prior conviction was acknowledged by him through his counsel. The record of the proceedings resulting in the conviction of the person named in the indictment was admitted in evidence in the trial of this defendant with the consent of his trial counsel.

On appeal, defendant alleged that the term &quot;occasion&quot; in &sect; 2A:85-12 included a plea to one or several indictments, such that so long as the convictions occurred on the same day, they should be taken as constituting one occasion. The court affirmed, holding that each allegation or indictment of defendant's previous convictions, although disposed of in groups on various days, required a separate and distinct plea, separate and individual determination as to bail or surety, separate trials, separate and distinct determinations as to sentence, and therefore each conviction was considered a separate occasion.

After the trial court's order denied defendant's writ of habeas corpus, he appealed, and contended that the denial of his constitutional rights in the judicial proceedings had resulted in his convictions, and that if he was returned to Georgia he would have been unable to obtain counsel to represent him in an attack upon the legality of his confinement. The court affirmed, and held that it was precluded from considering the proffered attack. The court held that the federal system presupposed confidence that a demanding state would not exploit the action of an asylum state by indulging in outlawed conduct to a returned fugitive from justice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The death sentence was commuted by the former Court of Pardons to imprisonment for life. After serving 25 years less credits on the term of life imprisonment, defendant made an application to the State Parole Board (Board) to appear before the Board and be considered for parole. The Board determined that it had no authority to consider for release on parole any prisoner upon whom a sentence of death had been imposed and commuted to imprisonment for life by action of the former Court of Pardons. The court held that the Board's ruling was invalid holding that the Board's pardoning power was not limited by 1948 N.J. Laws ch. 83, &sect; 4, which proscribed remittance or commutation except by the Governor. The grant of parole was not the grant of a remission, commutation, or a pardon.</SPAN></P>

That permit was denied and appellee challenged that ruling. The trial court found in favor of appellee and indicated that the relevant zoning ordinance of appellant, the local zoning board, did not regulate the use of vacant land and if it did such regulation was unconstitutional. Appellant challenged that ruling. On appeal, the court reversed and held that under most recent constitutional provisions it was clear that the regulation of vacant land was allowed. Additionally, appellant's zoning ordinance specifically dealt with the regulation of vacant land in the body of the ordinance despite the fact that such regulation was not indicated in the ordinance title. Despite this lack of notice provided through the title, the court found that appellant had the power to regulate appellee's vacant land under both local zoning ordinance and constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the sentence corrected to provide that defendant be imprisoned for a minimum term of 12 years and a maximum term of 14. Defendant then made another application to the trial court for correction and reduction of sentence, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial transcript showed that the sentence imposed was for the crime for which defendant had been convicted, namely, breaking and entering with intent to commit rape.

The trial court entered judgment denying the restraint and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs' arguments focused on alleged procedural defects in securing the referendum on the ballot. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that N.J. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a sentence for the crime of keeping of a place to which persons may resort for gambling in violation of N. J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:135-3, the court affirmed, holding that the sentences imposed were valid. Defendant argued that the provision of N. J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:135-3, as amended in 1940, which made the crime punishable by fine or imprisonment, not both, was a valid enactment. The prosecution argued that this provision of the 1940 amendment was unconstitutional; and, if it was not, that the balance of the 1940 amendment was unconstitutional and this provision, not being severable, must fall with the unconstitutional matter. Thus, the prosecution argued that N. J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:135, as enacted in 1937, was valid, which provided that the crime would be punished by both a fine and by imprisonment. The court held that and an essential factor in the application of the rule of severance was a finding of a clear indication of a legislative intention that it should be applied. The court held that was not the case here. The entire 1940 amendment must fall with its unconstitutional parts. Therefore, the 1940 amendment was unconstitutional and the 1937 amendment was applied..</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff deputy director of the state division of taxation filed an action against defendant service station to recover a penalty under the provisions of N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 56:6-2(b) and 56:6-3, based on the finding that the service station had sold motor fuel at a price below cost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy director had an audit report of the service station's operation, which indicated that the service station sold two kinds of gas and oil, and that while every item was sold for more than the purchase price, the gross profit realized on the gas was less than the allocated share of the cost of operating the business. The court held that while there was a presumption of constitutionality of legislation, the statutes in issue had to be reviewed under constitutional standards in order to determine the proper outcome of the case. The court noted that the statute made it a violation for retail dealers to sell below cost. The court determined that any discrimination between dealers as to price fixing was latent and could not be deemed unconstitutional. However, the court held the statute unenforceable due to the uncertainty of the terms. The court concluded that the terms &quot;net cost&quot; and &quot;selling expenses&quot; were too uncertain, where there was no statutory definition of net cost and no standard to determine what were proper expenses of selling. Accordingly, the court entered a judgment of acquittal against the service station.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of respondent parole board, which refused to consider appellant for parole from confinement under a sentence for conviction of robbery under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the denial by respondent parole board of appellant's motion for consideration of parole from a sentence for robbery. Appellant claimed that the Parole Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30:4-123.12 did not give respondent the power to classify prisoners as multiple offenders and must be interpreted as contemplating that the sentencing court was to hear and classify, as otherwise the legislation would be unconstitutional in violation of N.J. Const. art. I, para. 8, and U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV. The court affirmed respondent's denial of parole to appellant. The court held that respondent was not bound to give appellant a hearing upon the question of prior convictions, and failure to give it violated no constitutional rights. The court held that there was no occasion for respondent to give further consideration to the matter merely because appellant requested consideration for parole and now denied any previous convictions. Appellant, when previously confronted with his prior criminal record by prison authorities, including aliases, never denied his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed respondent parole board's denial of appellant's motion for consideration for parole on the grounds that appellant was a multiple offender, as the determination of appellant's eligibility for parole was a question of state policy exclusively for the state, rather than a judicial function.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant guilty, and he appealed the conviction, arguing that the ordinance was unenforceable because it was arbitrary, discriminatory and was not made to secure the health and well-being of plaintiff's citizens. The court held that plaintiff had a right to enact ordinances for the health and well-being of plaintiff's citizens, as long as the ordinance bore a reasonable and necessary relation to the general health and welfare. The court determined that it was reasonable to suppose that many health problems brought about by uncleanness and contagion with a dense and varied population, and with areas of substandard housing. The court stated that adopting measures to solve health problems need not wait for epidemics, and the public would be ill served if prevention of disease were not conceded to be a legitimate objective of the health department of a city. The court concluded that having one toilet per apartment was a reasonable ordinance and upheld defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The cleaning up of loose rock and the hauling of equipment both prior and subsequent to the passage of the ordinance were solely incidents to the working of the original quarry. Furthermore, defendant acquired the tract subject to the zoning ordinance and with full knowledge of the restrictions imposed thereunder.

Six months later, defendant was re-incarcerated on the original robbery conviction. Defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that his incarceration was illegal. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because the state had a right to imprison defendant on the original conviction, which sentence had not expired. The court stated that being released on parole for one conviction had no effect on the other, and therefore defendant was properly serving sentence on the original robbery. The court also concluded that defendant was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus on his claim that he was absent from the trial when the jury returned a guilty finding on the robbery charge, because defendant took too long to file the writ on this claim, and thus it had lapsed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was imprisoned for five consecutive terms of various lengths, which amounted to an aggregate minimum of 14 years and an aggregate maximum of 23 years. Upon entering prison, the prisoner was informed that he would be treated as one serving a single sentence of 14 to 23 years and that he was therefore entitled to the maximum allowance for good behavior. The time off for good behavior under the &quot;lumped&quot; sentence was greater than the combined days available under each of the five separate sentences. During the term of imprisonment, the &quot;lumping&quot; of sentences was declared illegal, and the condition of the prisoner's sentence was recalculated, thereby increasing the remaining time to be served. The prisoner petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, demanding his immediate release, on the basis that the computation of commutation time credits under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30:4-140 constituted an equitable relationship of sorts between the prisoner and the state. The court discharged the writ, holding that the courts have no authority to grant parole, nor to declare the occurrence of an automatic parole, even in the face of a wrongful denial of parole consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner ex-employee appealed an order that dismissed his claim for compensation benefits in favor of respondent ex-employer on the basis of lack of jurisdiction. Respondent contended that petitioner had rendered the jurisdiction of the matter exclusively federal because he had already achieved continued and successful recourse under the federal law pursuant to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act). The court affirmed and held that the state bureau that had resided over the matter lacked jurisdiction. The court held that petitioner had a right of recovery under either federal or state law, at his option, because the case was close as to whether jurisdiction was properly grounded in the state or federal courts. The court determined that if there was a legitimate area of doubt in which the state and federal compensation acts overlapped, the injured workman may recover under either of them, but not both. The court held that petitioner had clearly chosen to recover compensation benefits under the federal act and that, therefore, his state claims were barred.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with petitioners' contentions concerning regulations that established distribution of milk percentages, labeling requirements, and operational reports. The court ruled that respondent's milk distribution rule was invalid because its dominant purpose was to gain an economic advantage for certain private interests in the guise of general public health needs. The court found that respondent's labeling rule requiring information concerning the state in which the product was produced was invalid because it did not have a substantial, practical, or beneficial relation to the public health. The court held that respondent's requirement of a milk production report was invalid because it was overly burdensome and unrelated to the preservation of the public health.

The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the appeal was filed more than nine months after the dismissal of the application, and must be dismissed as not filed within time. The court stated that an appeal from a final judgment of a County Court in a habeas corpus proceeding was required to be taken within 45 days of the entry of the judgment.

Defendant was denied a permit to keep more than seven pigs. Defendant alleged the ordinance was unconstitutional and an arbitrary exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant managed a farm of approximately 120 acres. Defendant was keeping from 25 to 40 pigs on his land. Lincoln Park, N.J., Board of Health Code &sect; 2 allowed the holder of a permit to keep no more than seven pigs. Defendant applied for a permit to keep more than seven pigs but was refused. Plaintiffs, board of health and city, filed a cause of action against defendant for keeping pigs without first having procured a permit therefore. The trial court convicted defendant of violating &sect; 2. On appeal, defendant alleged the above ordinance was unconstitutional in that it violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the due process clause of both state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed. The court could not say that a limitation of seven pigs, without regard to area of the land, was constitutionally inappropriate. The court held that the limitation was reasonably calculated to achieve the stated purpose, which was to prevent piggeries. The court held that the ordinance did not offend the equal protection clause of amend. XIV. The court held the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of breaking, entering, and larceny, and was sentenced to life imprisonment under the Habitual Criminal Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:103-10 (1940), based upon three prior convictions for high misdemeanors. The prisoner petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because the habitual offender statute in effect when the prior misdemeanors were committed did not treat those convictions as prior offenses, and the statute, therefore, was an ex post facto law and unconstitutionally imposed cruel and unusual punishment. The court rejected the prisoner's claims, discharged the writ, and remanded him to custody. The court held that, even though the prior offenses occurred before the habitual offender statute was enacted, the statute was not an ex post facto law because it enhanced the punishment for the subsequent offense and did not punish again for the prior offenses. The enhancement of the prisoner's sentence by the imposition of a life sentence did not amount to the unconstitutional infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were charged with various offenses related to the operation and then sought to dismiss the indictments. The court denied defendants' motions to dismiss. The court held that the permitting of bookmaking could have constituted the operation of a disorderly house. The court further held that a motion to quash an indictment had to be addressed to the court's discretion, but ought not to be exercised when injustice could have resulted to the state and where a refusal to exercise it deprived defendants of no substantial rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was originally sentenced to a reformatory to serve a term of imprisonment that had a maximum term corresponding to the 15-year statutory maximum for the crime for which he was convicted. After he was paroled from the reformatory, the prisoner was convicted of a federal crime, and state authorities filed but did not pursue a detainer against the prisoner while he was in federal prison. After his release from federal prison, the prisoner was convicted of another crime in the state court and was sentenced to three years in state prison. The board of managers of the state reformatory thereupon revoked the prisoner's prior parole and ordered that the remaining six-year term of his original sentence be served in state prison. After a hearing on the prisoner's habeas corpus petition, the court held that the parole authorities did not lose jurisdiction over the prisoner by relinquishing the warrant filed as a detainer while the prisoner was in federal prison.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was sentenced to a reformatory for an indeterminate term not to exceed seven years.

The prisoner, thus, claimed that N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30:4-85 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 30:4-85 related solely to the administration and discipline of the institution in question, and did not increase or change the sentence originally imposed.

The court also rejected defendant's argument that the complaint was barred by the statute of limitations because it was not presented in the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband left plaintiff wife when questions arose as to whether he was the natural father of the couple's child. Plaintiff admitted to having a premarital affair, but contended that defendant was the child's father. Plaintiff refused to submit herself or the child to a blood test to verify paternity. After defendant left, plaintiff filed an action for support under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9:18-14. Defendant filed a motion under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:99-4 to have a blood test performed on plaintiff and the child. The trial court denied defendant's motion and entered an order requiring defendant to pay plaintiff a weekly sum for spousal and child support. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion. The court reversed, concluding that the trial court abused its discretion denying the motion because there were questions regarding paternity, a blood test was a reliable method for establishing paternity, and there appeared to be no valid reason for denying defendant's request. The court determined that plaintiff could not prevent the blood test by refusing to consent thereto, as &sect; 2:99-4 authorized the trial court to order a blood test regardless of consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sewer authority filed a petition, pursuant N.J. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:36A-36, seeking to condemn land owned by defendant borough. On the issuance of an order appointing condemnation commissioners, defendant filed a notice of appeal under N.J. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:81-7, contending that plaintiff lacked the power to condemn because that power was unconstitutional and precluded by an earlier statute. The court first found that defendant's appeal was maintainable, although the order was interlocutory. The court then proceeded to affirm the lower court's order, holding that plaintiff was legally empowered to condemn land in keeping with its legislative mandate to control pollution. The empowering statute,&nbsp;N.J. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:36A-1 et seq., was drafted to create equal protection, and so was constitutional from that point of view. The court also held that defendant, as a creature created by the state, lacked standing to assert deprivation of constitutional rights. Finally, the court held that &sect; 40:36A-1 et seq. superceded the repealed N.J. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58:15-5, which defendant contended controlled. On these bases, the court affirmed the order of appointment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff attendance officer charged defendant father with failing to cause his children to regularly attend public schools, failing to cause them to attend a day school with equivalent instruction, and failing to provide them with equivalent instruction elsewhere. Defendant sought exoneration from his conduct by advancing that N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18:14-14 was unconstitutional because it violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that he provided instruction equivalent to the provided in the public schools for children of similar grades and attainment. The court concluded that the statute was valid because it did not infringe upon any constitutional limitation and that the children were not receiving instruction equivalent to that provided in public schools because the wife was not a qualified teacher and the children did not associate with other children. Defendant was guilty as charged and found to be a disorderly person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner milk wholesalers filed a declaratory judgment action against respondent director of the office of milk industry. Petitioners argued that the Milk Control Act of 1941 (Act), P.L. 1941, c. 274, was unconstitutional because it delegated power to respondent without a sufficient legislative standard and because the emergency causing the statute's passage had ended. Petitioners claimed that the Reorganization Act of 1948, P.L. 1948, c. 447, violated N.J. Const., art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 4. The statutes directed respondent to take measures necessary to prevent unfair practices likely to interfere with the maintenance of a supply of fresh milk. The court dismissed the petition, holding that the Milk Control Act contained a clear guiding standard delegating power, and that there was no evidence that the emergency necessitating its passage had ceased to exist. The court found that the Reorganization Act did not violate the constitution. The court held that while the statute impermissibly provided for orders of respondent to be reviewed by the appellate division rather than the superior court, the statute was not unconstitutional for the purpose of the declaratory judgment proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife sought review of an order of the Superior Court (New Jersey), which denied her application to amend her complaint. According to the lower court, plaintiff's action against defendants, her husband's relatives, sounded in alienation of affections. Plaintiff alleged that defendants conspired to injure plaintiff in her marital relationship with her husband. The lower court dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed suit against defendants, her husband's family members, and charged that they had maliciously conspired to injure plaintiff in her marriage. The lower court struck the complaint, dismissed the action, and denied plaintiff's motion to amend. On appeal, the court affirmed. A complaint based on interference with the marital relations while the parties were living together, and on a willful continued interference after they had separated, was a suit for alienation of affections. N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:39A-1 et seq., abolished the right of action for alienation of affections. Thus, the lower court was correct when it struck the complaint as it then stood. Plaintiff argued that &sect; 2:39A-1 et seq. was unconstitutional in that it offended against N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, par. 4 (1844), which provided that every law should embrace but one object, and that should be expressed in the title. The argument against the constitutionality of the statute was based upon the proposition that the complaint sounded in conspiracy. The fact was, however, that it sounded in alienation of affections. The constitutional attack was without merit, and the application to amend was too vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing plaintiff wife's action and denying her motion to amend was affirmed. Plaintiff wife's complaint sounded in alienation of affections, not conspiracy as she claimed, so it was barred by statute. The record disclosed no statement of what the purported amendment was to be, nor was it submitted to the lower court in writing. An application to amend had to be definite and categorical, not vague or unexpressed.</SPAN></P>

Appellants alleged that the tax assessor's previous assessments were correct and that the revised assessments were below the true value of said property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board reduced assessments made by the tax assessor on certain land. Appellant tax district challenged the board's action, arguing that the previous assessment was correct and that the revised assessments were below the true value of said property, and hence, discriminatory. The county board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which was affirmed by respondent tax authority. The lower court granted writs of certiorari to review respondent's action. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the dismissal of appellant's petitions was improper because the county board had jurisdiction to hear the appeals, and petitioner had a right to challenge an assessment under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:3-21 and N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:3-701. The court found that because petitioner had a right to appeal an over assessment, the possibility that an appeal could have resulted in a revenue surplus, thus unbalancing the city's budget, was insufficient a reason to deny the appeals. Further, the mailing of the tax bills, which showed the revised, reduced assessments, did not operate as a waiver of the right of appeal because such mailing was required under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:4-64.</SPAN></P>

The likelihood that an appeal could cause have caused a revenue surplus did not justify denying the appeal.</SPAN></P>
