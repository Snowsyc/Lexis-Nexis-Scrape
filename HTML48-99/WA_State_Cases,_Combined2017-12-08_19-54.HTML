<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, state legislators, brought an original proceeding in mandamus to compel respondent state treasurer to execute, issue and/or honor warrants drawn on certain specified funds for the expenses of the Washington Legislative Council for the duration of the 1963-65 biennium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislators argued that the governor had exceeded his constitutional authority in vetoing the 1963 appropriation for the legislative council, and had invaded the domain of the legislature, thus impairing or destroying the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government as provided for in the state constitution. The court found that the governor's actions strictly complied with the provisions of Wash. Const. art. 3, &sect; 12, which contained no exceptions restricting his power to veto items appropriating funds for any legislative purpose. The court further found that the governor had no control over the time of the adjournment of the 1963 extraordinary session. Because the court held that the governor's veto was valid, it found that there was no appropriation of funds for the legislative council, and the state treasurer had no authority to comply with the demand of the legislators to honor the vouchers and issue warrants upon the moneys referred to therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a steamship operators association, challenged the decision of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which held that the association was estopped from challenging an order for a rate increase entered by appellee, the state's board of pilotage commissioners. The association argued that substituting a third party in place of the director of labor and industries on the board violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 88.16.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Puget Sound Pilotage Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 88.16.010, required that the board of pilotage commissioners include the state's director of labor and industries. The director appointed the supervisor of industrial relations to act in his place. When the board authorized increases in the rates charged for pilotage in certain areas, a local steamship operators association challenged the increase in the superior court. The superior court held that the Act, which had a declared legislative purpose and sufficient guidelines, was constitutional. The superior court also held that under the Act, the association had been entitled to a decision from a board that included the state director and not a substitute. The duty of the director to sit on the board, particularly in a discretionary function, was not delegable. However, the superior court found that the association was estopped to challenge board's composition. On appeal, the court adopted the superior court's opinion on constitutionality and delegation but reversed on the estoppel issue. The court explained that the board had lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the rate increase. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the superior court that the association was entitled to a decision from a pilotage board that included the director of labor and industries. The court disagreed that the association was estopped from challenging the board's subject matter jurisdiction over the rate increase. The court vacated the judgment, reversed, and remanded for a rehearing by a legally constituted board of pilotage commissioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was convicted in municipal court of the offense of aiding and abetting failure to leave information at the scene of an accident in violation of Spokane, Wash., Ordinance No. C12833 &sect; 46.52.020. The director, upon having been informed that the motorist violated &sect; 46.52.020, summarily suspended the motorist's license without conducting any further investigation. The lower court upheld the director's action and dismissed the motorist's appeal, and the court reversed. The court held that the lower court erred in limiting the scope of the motorist's hearing to the issue of whether the motorist had violated &sect; 46.52.020. The court ruled that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.290 required the director to exercise his sound discretion in deciding whether the motorist's infraction merited a license suspension and that the director could not relegate the suspension of licenses to a simple mechanistic process. The court held that due process required a full hearing at some stage of the proceedings and that the lower court was required to conduct a de novo concerning the merits of the director's suspension of the motorist's driver's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relators obtained a warranty deed for a large plat of land. The relators applied for a building permit in order to construct a residence on their property. City officials informed the relators that it would not issue a permit for construction on any properties within the plat because their lot was in an unapproved area. The city did not intimate at any time that the relators' proposed plans and specifications failed to comply with the city's zoning regulations. The trial court confirmed the city's refusal. The relators filed a writ of mandamus to compel the city to issue a building permit enabling them to construct a residence on their property. The relators appealed the trial court's subsequent denial. On appeal, the court reversed. The court recognized that property owners who complied with applicable zoning ordinances had vested rights to use their property. The court held that the city did not have discretion to refuse the relator's application for a building permit because the application showed that that plans and specifications conformed to zoning regulations and met the structural requirements of the city's building code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant abutting property owners sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for Thurston County, Washington, which affirmed an order of respondent, the Washington State Highway Commission, finding that a proposed limited access highway was required by the public convenience and necessity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission desired to relocate the existing route of a primary state highway. It asked the Director of Highways to prepare a plan to establish a limited access highway. The plan established a freeway passing under the existing route. The abutting property owners had land located in the northwest quadrant formed by the overpass intersection of the existing route and the proposed freeway. The proposed plan deprived the owners of all of their right of access to the existing route. The Commission conducted two hearings on the proposed plan. It then found that the proposed plan was required by the public convenience and necessity and instructed the Director to take the necessary steps to acquire access rights and any property necessary to make the improvement. On appeal, the court held that the Limited Access Facilities Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.52, was constitutional because the accomplishment of its objectives merely fulfilled a condition precedent to maintaining an eminent domain action, in which the State had to prove its right to a certificate of public use and necessity. The court also held that the Commission's findings were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Washington State Board Against Discrimination, filed a motion to dismiss the challenge of appellants, a corporate realtor and its agent, to an order of a superior court (Washington), which directed the agent to appear before the Board to testify in response to the Board's subpoena relative to an action filed by complainant, a black potential home buyer, in which he charged that appellants had discriminated against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer alleged that the agent had shown him three homes in a certain area, all of which had &quot;for sale&quot; signs out front, and the buyer had expressed a definite interest in buying one of them. However, the agent failed to show up at a meeting scheduled for the next day, and the following day the houses all had &quot;sold&quot; signs on them. The buyer filed a discrimination complaint with the Board, which subpoenaed the agent, but he refused to appear. The superior court issued an order directing the agent to appear before the Board and made a finding that the brokerage was a place of public accommodation and that the buyer had alleged an act of discrimination against the realtor and its agent, the investigation of which was within the jurisdiction of the Board. The court granted the Board's motion to dismiss the agent's appeal of the superior court's order to appear before the Board because the order was not a final judgment within the meaning of Wash. R. App. P. 14. The legislature had provided for an appeal to the court in discrimination cases only from a final judgment of the superior court containing an enforcement order rendered after a hearing on the merits of the controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individuals and corporations, who were variously engaged in the auto wrecking business and the iron and metal business, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant, the city of Seattle, praying that Seattle, Wash., Ordinance No. 90000, &sect; 60, be declared void and that the city be permanently enjoined from enforcing &sect; 60. The Superior Court for King County, Washington, dismissed the action, and plaintiffs sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that &sect; 60, regulating emissions of &quot;smoke,&quot; was unconstitutional because of the &quot;opacity&quot; standard used and the mandatory application of a particular chart. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action. The court held that the &quot;opacity&quot; standard was not unreasonable merely because it did not detect all of the air contaminants. The court noted that a law designed to prevent one evil was not void because it did not prevent another. Similarly, while it was true that the chart measured coloration and not opacity, it did not necessarily follow that the chart could not have reasonably been used as a basis for determining opacity. The court also held that the regulation of solid particles emitted from heat processing equipment on the basis of the process weight table and the regulation of solid particles emitted from burning conducted by plaintiffs on the basis of the chart constituted reasonable regulations based upon reasonable classifications. Economic hardships did not affect the constitutional validity of the ordinance because plaintiffs failed to show that the ordinance was clearly unreasonable and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner operated a school of beauty culture and had three licenses issued under the Act. The owner was charged with violating the Act, and a complaint prayed for the revocation or suspension of her licenses. The members were appointed to serve on a hearing committee to determine the charges. The owner filed a motion for the members to disqualify themselves. The motion was denied, so the owner served an application and affidavit for writ of prohibition and an order to show cause. The trial court decided adversely to the owner, and she appealed, arguing that the members were not qualified under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.24.110. She claimed that as owners of beauty shops, the members were part of a different and hostile calling from beauty schools. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling. The members were qualified practitioners of the same calling as the owner within the meaning of &sect; 43.24.110. The members' participation in a union did not form a basis for disqualifying the members.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state finance committee sought mandamus relief to compel respondent state treasurer to allow issuance of the limited obligation bonds authorized by the School Bond Act, 1961 Wash. Laws ch. 3, p. 2521, and the Public Building Bond Act, 1961 Wash. Laws ch. 23, p. 2656. The treasurer challenged the constitutionality of the statutes prescribing the bonds and the legality of the resolutions authorizing the issuance of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state treasurer refused to concur in resolutions adopted by the finance committee to issue the obligation bonds. The court granted mandamus relief; however it prospectively overruled Gruen v. State Tax Comm., 211 P.2d 651 (Wash. 1949). Any obligation which must in law be paid from any taxes levied was a debt of the state and therefore subject to the debt limitation in Wash. Const. art. 8. There was no basis for the assertion in Gruen that in using the word &quot;debt,&quot; the framers of the state constitution referred only to an obligation payable only out of ad valorem taxes as the they had little or no knowledge of excises. Instead, the framers of the state constitution knew of excises as one means of providing revenue for the general government. Although it overruled Gruen insofar as it held that the issuance and sale of limited obligation bonds funded by excise taxes did not contravene Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1 and Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 3, and as to all future enactments cognizable under the debt limitation ruling of that case, it was inappropriate to grant this decision retroactive effect as state officials had a right to rely on Gruen when making past funding decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted mandamus relief and directed the state treasurer to complete the issuance and sale of the bonds authorized; however, it prospectively overruled Gruen to the extent that it allowed the state to exceed the debt limitation of fixed by Wash. Const. art. 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gravel company operated a gravel pit as a non-conforming use in an area that had been zoned residential. The Commission and the Board approved the gravel company's application for a conditional use permit to install and operate an asphalt plant on the property. The homeowner, whose property was adjacent to the gravel company property, appealed to the trial court. The trial court upheld the decision, and the court affirmed the trial court's action. The court held that the Board's action in amending Snohomish County, Wash., Zoning Res. No. 7, &sect; 8(b) to allow asphalt plants as conditional uses was not unconstitutional special legislation because the enactment extended the right to everyone and to the whole zoning district. Nothing in the zoning code provided that the Commission had to make written findings of fact. The court also found that the zoning code did not prohibit non-conforming uses from being enlarged. The conditional use permit for the asphalt plant was allowed in the residential zone because the area was undeveloped and the proposed temporary equipment would not be unduly detrimental to the existing, developing, or projected use of land in the surrounding area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor attempted to avert insolvency by giving a mortgage for the security of its creditors to the mortgagee.

The mortgagee claimed priority of its claims over the tax claims pursuant Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.32.220. The trial court found &sect; 82.32.220 discriminatory, so that it adjudged the mortgagee's lien superior to the State's tax lien. In reversing the decision, the court found that the statute was a constitutional exercise of the State's taxing power. The court found that the State has the power to fix priority in lien situations and such power extended to the State itself to declare tax liens superior to all liens incurred in the operation of a business. The State had the power to classify in exercising its taxing power as long as the classification was not arbitrary.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for robbery and its finding that he was an habitual criminal. The court held that defendant's rights to an impartial jury under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 were not violated because peremptory challenges were not exercised to select jurors but to exclude jurors. The court ruled that any juror who was peremptorily challenged was presumably an impartial juror. The court also held that because there were legitimate grounds for distinguishing between single defendants and multiple defendants that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.49.060 did not violate defendant's equal protection rights. The court ruled that a finding that one was an habitual criminal was not a criminal conviction. Therefore, Wash. Rev.

The trial court rendered judgment quieting title in the waterway district, but held that the waterway district was estopped from ejecting the company. On review, the company argued that a public body was estopped to deny access to a public facility to a landowner specially assessed for construction of the facility. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the waterway district had no power to lease any area within the 500-foot right of way it acquired by condemnation and purchase for the construction of the waterway. Additionally, the court held that the waterway district held title to the same area in its governmental capacity, and that the company could acquire title to any portion of it by adverse possession.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high school district's county committee proposed a plan to the Board for the expansion of the high school as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28.56.010. The Board rejected the plan on the basis that the non-high school district's contributions were inadequate and recommended a higher rate of contribution. The committee adopted the state's recommendations. The districts brought suit. The superior court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but was reversed by the court. On remand, the superior court awarded judgment to the Board and the committee. The district appealed. The court affirmed. The rejection of the committee's original plan and submission of suggestions was within the Board's authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28.56.020 because the Board had considered all of the factors. The committee had been free to resubmit its original plan with facts sustaining its findings or to submit a compromise plan, but it had considered and rejected those options. The court declined to address the districts' assertion that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28.56.040 was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority because review was precluded by the districts' failure to make the argument below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the grand jury proceedings were erroneously conducted because an unauthorized person was allowed to present before the jury. One of the attorneys who was appointed to investigate the matter had been commissioned as an honorary deputy sheriff. Because of this, defendant alleged that he was not authorized to appear before the grand jury in the capacity of special deputy prosecuting attorney. Upon review, the court found that the issuance of a commission and enrolling of the attorney as a deputy sheriff did not operate to disqualify him to practice law, in the absence of an affirmative acceptance of the commission on his part. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of willful neglect of duty under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.20.100. The jury was correctly instructed that defendant could arrest for a misdemeanor under circumstances, which would lead a reasonably prudent officer to believe on good faith that there had been a violation of the law. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.84.200, which prescribed for taxing costs and taking objections, applied to criminal as well as civil cases.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the resolution could not have become effective insofar as defendant's property was concerned until December 5, 1958, when the map was filed showing that defendant's property was zoned as residential; (2) the use thereof by defendant as a wrecking yard was a lawful use in October 1958 and a lawful nonconforming use when the zoning resolution became effective; (3) there was no contention here that defendant's wrecking yard constituted a nuisance; and (4) in the absence of facts establishing a nuisance or circumstances showing a condition substantially detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare, zoning ordinances or resolutions that attempted to immediately abolish existing nonconforming uses were unconstitutional insofar as they deprived individuals of vested rights without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

Because the boundary of respondent's land was not definitely established so that appellants could be charged with knowledge of it, the trial court found that treble damages under Wash. Rev.

However, the trial court awarded damages for the Christmas trees that were cut down under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 79.40.070. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the trial court's award of damages was both a conclusion of law under &sect; 79.40.070 and a finding of fact based on evidence of the Christmas trees' market value. Because appellants failed set out the findings of fact excepted to, the court held that it could not consider their argument that the findings of fact were not supported by the evidence. The court noted that the judgment was supported by the findings of fact as to the market value independent of &sect; 79.40.070 and, thus, found no need to determine the validity of that statute.</SPAN></P>

The Toll Bridge Authority authorized a bond issue to refund both issues, and the state auditor refused to sign the bond. The Toll Bridge Authority sought an original mandamus application to compel the state auditor to sign refunding bonds. The court granted the application and issued a writ of mandate compelling the state auditor to sign the refunding bonds. The court reasoned that the ferry systems were integral parts of the highway system and that any loan would ultimately be repaid from tolls. The court held that the temporary employment of such funds to assist the development of the state highway system was within the diversion interdicted by the eighteenth amendment of the Washington Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to grand larceny, was granted a deferred sentence, and placed upon probation. He was subsequently arrested in another city and held on suspicion of grand larceny. The prosecutor filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation, alleging an admission by defendant to commission of the crime of grand larceny and that at the time of granting probation, defendant was on bail from a robbery charge in another state. Defendant appeared without counsel and his probation was revoked. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. On remand, counsel was appointed to represent defendant. At his second revocation hearing, the superior court revoked defendant's probation. On appeal, the court modified the superior court's order by granting defendant credit for time he had served in prison and, as modified, affirmed. The court remanded with directions to amend the judgment so that it stated the time from which the sentence and imprisonment should run. The court held that defendant's larcenous acts were the basis of the revocation and that the superior court did not abuse its discretion or abridge any of defendant's statutory or constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which convicted him of attempted second-degree burglary after a jury trial. Defendant claimed that the evidence showed burglary in the second degree, not an attempt of that crime and that failure to consummate the crime intended was an essential element of attempt under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.01.070. He also challenged the constitutionality of that section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that part of &sect; 9.01.070 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it gave the trial judge discretion to permit a conviction on attempt or to direct a trial on the crime itself. The trial court did not, however, discharge the jury and direct a trial on the crime of second degree burglary. The court rejected defendant's contention that failure to consummate the crime intended was an essential element of attempt, citing Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.01.070 for the proposition that a conviction for attempt was proper even where it appeared that the crime was consummated. It held that attempts covered both successful and unsuccessful efforts and that attempt was an offense included in the crime itself. The court refused to reach the constitutional question regarding &sect; 9.01.070, holding that defendant lacked standing to urge the unconstitutionality of that section because he was not harmfully affected by the particular feature challenged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court for King County (Washington), in a murder trial, instructed the jury that it could acquit defendant upon his plea of insanity only if it determined that he was unable to perceive the moral qualities of the act with which he was charged and was unable to tell right from wrong with reference to the act charged (the M'Naghten rule). The jury convicted defendant of murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that defendant's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated by the surreptitious recording of a confession because the Fifth Amendment did not apply to state action. The court also held that evidence supported the finding of premeditation necessary for the first-degree murder conviction because premeditation for only a moment was sufficient. The trial court had properly refused to play a tape made by a psychiatrist who interviewed defendant because the psychiatrist was allowed to give his opinion as to defendant's mental condition based upon the examination and the tape might have been subject to misinterpretation or misuse by the jury. Finally, the court provided an extensive review of the various insanity standards. The court rejected defendant's proposed instruction which would have permitted the jury to find defendant not criminally responsible if he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his act or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. The court noted that the legislature had indicated that the insanity defense should be restricted to constitutional requirements, which were embodied in the M'Naghten rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted of drunk driving in violation of a municipal ordinance.

The driver contended that the Director failed to comply with the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, Wash. Rev. Code tit. 34, that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.290(4) was unconstitutional, and that the Director was empowered to revoke or suspend operator licenses under &sect; 46.20.290(4) only for violations of state law, which did not include municipal ordinances. On review, the court found no basis for reversal in view of these contentions. The court concluded that a violation of an ordinance could constitute a serious violation of the motor vehicle laws, under &sect; 46.20.290(4), and that it justified the actions by the Director.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the broadcaster applied for the permit to build the transmitter station, consisting of one building and three radio towers, the Board ruled that a permit was proper, but it lacked jurisdiction to grant it. Upon judicial review, the neighbors intervened in opposition. The superior court ruled that the Board did have jurisdiction. The Board then issued the permit, and the decision was upheld on review. The neighbors appealed from both rulings. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that, under King County, Wash., Zoning Code &sect; 4.02(1), the Board had jurisdiction to issue conditional use permits to &quot;public utilities.&quot; Under federal precedent, radio broadcasting was a business that so directly affected the public interest that such a facility was a public utility within the meaning of &sect; 4.02(1), which was valid and did not impermissibly allow for spot zoning in violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The Board was not impermissibly delegated legislative powers without any standards for the issuance of conditional use permits in agricultural districts, but was governed by the criteria set out in King County, Wash., Zoning Code &sect;&sect; 2.04(C), 14.01:1, 27.00:1, 29.03, and 29.04.</SPAN></P>

The town argued that the evidence was insufficient and instructions were improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town constructed a lagoon above wells that constituted the sole domestic water supply for the owners' homes. All of the sewage from the town was deposited into the lagoon. The owners filed a reverse eminent domain action against the town, and a jury awarded them damages. The town appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict, and that the instructions to the jury were proper. It was beyond controversy that the town's daily discharge of sewage effluent into the lagoon rendered the owners' water supply unfit for human consumption. The award of damages to each owner was well within the range of the evidence. The owners properly testified as to the loss in value of their homes. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to submit special interrogatories to the jury. The instructions to the jury respecting the measure of damages for nuisance were correct. The jury was not misled by an instruction using the phrase &quot;guilty of maintaining a nuisance&quot;. The town was not entitled to a new trial because of the trial court's refusal to give instructions on the town's right to construct the lagoon and on proof of damages.</SPAN></P>

Both convictions arose from the same act by defendant and both were appealed to the trial court. The trial court consolidated the actions. The trial court reversed the convictions on the ground that both ordinances were unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, both established no ascertainable standard of guilt, and both made innocent or justifiable acts criminal offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court held in the city's declaratory judgment action against defendants that, due to the federal government's &quot;paramount jurisdiction&quot; over navigable streams, the controls that 1961 Wash. Law ch. 4 placed on constructing dams did not affect the city's general authority to construct, to maintain, and to operate power facilities or its specific authority to build the disputed dams under its license from the Federal Power Commission (FPC). The court affirmed that judgment on appeal, reasoning that the United States Supreme Court concluded that the state laws could not have prevented the FPC from issuing a license or barred the licensee from acting under the license to build a dam on a navigable stream. The court also held that enacting the Federal Power Act exercised the Congressional power to authorize the FPC to supersede the state laws that purported to prohibit or to limit dam construction on navigable streams. The court further determined that 1961 Wash.

The court affirmed and held that because the contract was illegal, appellant could not invoke the doctrine of estoppel to enforce it. Appellant's second contention, that he was entitled to recover from respondents the minimum wage prescribed by the minimum wage act, Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States and King County appealed the decision of the trial court, which in a receivership proceeding related to the dissolution of a corporation determined the priority in which claims should be paid. The United States sought a reversal as to the trial court order finding that the wage claimants took priority over the claims of the United States. The court held that the trial court had applied the priorities of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, as provided by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 23.01.610, in giving the wage claimants priority over the tax claim of the United States. This was error and the court reversed on the appeal of the United States. As to King County, the court affirmed, holding that the type of lien held by the county could not defeat the priority of the United States, under 31 U.S.C.S &sect; 191. The court also held inter alia, that King County lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 23.01.610, and King County's claims were not an expense of administration. The cause was remanded to determine the rights of the remaining claimants to monies then remaining in custodia legis, according to provisions of &sect; 23.01.610.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to determine priority of claims against a corporation in receivership, the court affirmed the order that King County's claim was subordinated to the wage claims; and also affirmed the claim of the Tax Commission to be paid in full. The claim of the United States to be paid in full was reversed. The cause was remanded for further proceedings regarding the rights of the remaining claimants to monies remaining with the receiver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for neglecting to perform a duty of office by permitting the keeping of a house of prostitution and the practice of prostitution within Snohomish County and was found guilty as charged in a jury trial. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal of the conviction. The County's Board of Commissioners declared defendant's office vacated pursuant to &sect;&sect; 42.12.010, 9.92,120. Defendant urged that the action should not have been taken until the appeal of the conviction was resolved, citing Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 22. The prosecuting attorney filed the instant information in quo warranto and prevailed. Defendant appealed, and the court held that Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 22 did no more than guarantee defendant the right to appeal his criminal conviction. Defendant's ouster was a matter entirely unrelated to the criminal appeal just as a loss of employment was unrelated to the appeal of any criminal defendant who was not a public officer. As a public officer, defendant could and should be removed irrespective of his own interests should the community's interests so require. Defendant's removal from the office of sheriff as a result of his conviction was not a punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district was a non-high school district.

The trial court granted respondents' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, holding that the decision regarding the district's contribution was not a judicial function. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction because Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1 provided for the courts' authority to issue writs of review, which could not be abridged by legislative enactment. The court held that the determination of the district's obligation to meet educational requirements was subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion or arbitrary and capricious action on the part of respondents, and that the allegation that respondents coerced the committee into raising the district's obligation, stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission had granted free franchises to the utilities to construct facilities on the right of way of a secondary state highway. The utilities were later asked to move for highway construction. A dispute arose between the utilities and the commission as to who should pay the relocation cost. The state instituted declaratory judgment actions against each of the utilities, contending that &sect; 47.44.030, which provided that the commission would pay utilities that had to move for highway construction, was unconstitutional, and that the removal and relocation expense was an obligation of the utilities. The trial court found that &sect; 47.44.030 was constitutional and decreed that the utility facilities be removed and relocated at state expense. The court reversed and held that &sect; 47.44.030 was unconstitutional. The state motor vehicle fund could not be used to cover the cost of relocation of the utility facilities because such an expenditure would not be &quot;exclusively for highway purposes,&quot; which would have been repugnant to Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association alleged that its business was entirely interstate in character, and that the tax amounted to a direct burden on interstate commerce and a taking of property without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. On appeal, the court found that the association qualified for an exemption under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1002(c), and, therefore, was not subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission as a freight forwarder. Ownership of the merchandise in transit depended upon the contractual relationships between the buyers and sellers. Accordingly, each member handled its own claims when damage in shipment occurred. The court held that the tax was not invalid on the ground of due process. The tax was not a tax on the privilege of doing interstate business. The court found that interstate commerce could have been conducted without the services of the association. The members could arrange their transactions individually and enjoy the tax immunities of the commerce clause. But a local corporation, organized under the laws of Washington, performing local activities and serving local establishments, was subject to the tax.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded them compensation. On appeal, the State asserted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.28.026 violated Colo. Const. art.

On appeal, defendant argued that the charge of robbery did not inform him that he would be subjected to the Habitual Criminal Act's penalty if he were convicted. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge. The court determined that the Act created no substantive offense. Instead, it established a mandatory penalty for a third felony conviction. Defendant also asserted that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that burglary and murder were felonies.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the city, and the tavern owner filed an appeal. The court held that an ordinance prohibiting the use of any coin-operated juke or music boxes was a valid exercise of the city's municipal power. The court further held that the scope of the inquiry was limited to whether the ordinance at issue had a reasonable and substantial relation to the accomplishment of some purpose within the legitimate range of the city's police power. The court could not say that the ordinance at issue was unreasonable or oppressive, or that it did not have a substantial relation to the accomplishment of a purpose within a municipality's police power.

On appeal, defendant argued that admission of the confession into evidence violated his rights to due process under the Federal and state constitutions. The court determined that the confession was admitted into evidence by the trial judge. It was submitted to the jury under instructions, which were appropriate to the factual issue of voluntariness. The court concluded that the question of voluntariness of the confession was properly submitted and passed upon by the jury under the procedure existing at the time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's only assigned error was admission of testimony that he was carrying an unlicensed pistol and the related jury instruction under Wash. Rev.

The court held that the statute was constitutional, while noting that not all jurisdictions agreed. It also held that the definition given of prima facie evidence was reversible error because it placed the burden on defendant to overcome that evidence. In view of the aura of uncertainty relating to the effect of the statute, and despite the fact that defendant had not challenged the definition, the court departed from the rule that defendant must direct attention to a specific error in an instruction before it could be addressed on appeal. The conviction was set aside, and the case was remanded because of the erroneous definition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition was filed to create a wheat commission. A hearing resulted in a recommended marketing order. A referendum pursuant to the statutory formula ratified the marketing order, and the wheat commission was established. Respondent wheat producers appealed the marketing order. The trial court found that the Act was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court found that the title of the Act gave notice and an indication of what it dealt with. The court concluded that the Act was within the police powers of the State. The Act did not contain unreasonable classifications because it exempted producers of less than 500 bushels of wheat annually. The proof that the cost of collection would have exceeded the resulting revenue was a sufficient reason for excluding small producers. The assessment authorized by the Act was an excise, rather than a property tax. It was only levied upon the commercial producers and imposed a privilege for carrying on a business activity. The provision for appellate review by the director of the Department was not an unlawful delegation of judicial power and did not preclude the superior courts from reviewing the action of the director.</SPAN></P>

The superior court ultimately held that the director's failure to afford the driver a hearing before suspending his license violated the Act. The superior court then issued a permanent injunction against the director. On appeal by the director, the court noted that a hearing was required under &sect; 46.20.290 if the proposed suspension was a contested case. The court found no statute that required a hearing prior to a license suspension by the director. The court also found no right under Wash. Const. art.

The legislature had the right to exercise its police power in the interest of public safety, provided that an aggrieved party had an opportunity to be heard before the action became final.

The court reversed the trial court's decision and found that under 1888-1890 Wash.

The codified version of the statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.12.010, provided the opposite and barred annexation if the population of the territory was more than 2,000. However, the statute law, as adopted by the legislature, prevailed over a restatement thereof in the code. The court also found that the city's other objections to the writ of prohibition were equally without merit.

The court found that the companies were liable to the State pursuant to &sect; 76.04.370 because they had conducted their operations during a hot and dry season knowing that the fire hazard that they would have been powerless to abate was continued if not increased. Further, the court ruled that the costs of fire fighting could have been made necessary by more than one company. The court noted that those possibilities created questions of fact. The court indicated that the issue of a future right to contribution among the companies after the State received reimbursement was not properly a part of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an action against defendant to recover money paid on checks allegedly bearing forged signatures. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that plaintiff violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 30.16.020 (1955) by failing to give timely notice of the forgeries. On appeal, plaintiff contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it departed from common law rule and deprived it of property. The court held plaintiff had no vested interest in the common law. Section 30.16.020 was in effect when plaintiff opened its account and contracted with defendant. It was within the legislature's police powers to change the common law regarding banking regulation, and it did not deprive plaintiff of any property or other right.

The judge denied the motion to dismiss and found respondent guilty. After the trial court granted his motion for habeas corpus, the state appealed. The court reversed, holding that respondent's contention that the fee justice court lacked jurisdiction because the justice was prejudiced against him because she was not compensated by way of a fixed salary was without merit. The court determined that the alleged bias or prejudice of the fee justice affected only the venue or the forum of the trial, which respondent did not challenge. Further, &sect; 3.16.070 was promulgated pursuant to Wash. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner challenged a decision of the Superior Court for Pierce County, Washington, which in a set of consolidated actions enjoined the incorporation of land which belonged to respondents port and city, and which permitted the city to annex property which belonged to the port. The petitioner asserted that under 1951 Wash. Laws Ch. 109, p. 270, incorporation was not limited in the manner that annexation was.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petitioner sought to incorporate a fourth-class town on land owned by a port. The port subsequently asked a city to annex land included in the incorporation petition. The trial court dismissed the petitioner's action to enjoin the city and port from proceeding with the annexation and enjoined the incorporation proceeding. That decision was affirmed by the court. The central dispute in this matter involved the applicability of 1889-90 Wash. Laws Ch. 7, &sect; 15, p. 141, which prohibits the original incorporation or annexation by a fourth-class town of more than 20 acres of unplatted land belonging to one person without the owner's consent. This area limitation was seemingly altered by 1951 Wash. Laws Ch. 109, p. 270, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.27.020, which made that limitation inapplicable to incorporation proceedings. Apparently, this alteration was not made in accord with Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37, which required the revision of acts and amendment of sections to be set forth at full length and not made by a mere reference to the title of the amended passage. An act purporting to amend a section of a compilation had no effect on the law.</SPAN></P>

The city contended that this was in error and sought a declaratory judgment to that effect. The lower court determined that the contract was valid. The city appealed. The court found that the election to form the municipal corporation was proper and that the error on the ballot constituted a minor irregularity. The court found that Wash. Rev.

Defendant next asserted that the State produced no evidence that would support a conviction of negligent homicide. The court disagreed and held that there was sufficient evidence that, if believed by a jury, would support the verdict. Finally, defendant contended that the negligent homicide statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.56.040, was unconstitutional because it authorized the State to charge violations of the statute either as a misdemeanor or as a felony.

The trial court affirmed the decision of the justice court, and the State sought review.

The statute was void under a recent United States Supreme Court precedent because it did not provide an element of mens rea or guilty knowledge. Because the statute was based on strict liability, it unduly restricted the freedoms of speech and press. If the statute was given effect, a magazine seller would be reluctant to sell his wares without first having ascertained their contents and would, thus, restrict the public access to constitutionally-protected publications. Also, there was no fundamental distinction between books and magazines regarding the applicability of the precedent.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 6, p. 29, and 1959 Wash. Laws ch. 78, p. 490 constitutional. The retiree also sought a money judgment for an amount due under his increased pension. The trial court held the acts constitutional and awarded the money judgment. Appellants, the City of Spokane and the police pension fund, requested review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1959 Wash. Laws 6 increased the retiree's pension retroactive to July 1, 1957. The Pension Fund increased the retiree's pension as of January 27, 1959 but refused to backdate the increase. The pension fund claimed that the 1959 enactments violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 25 because the pension fund was not permitted to increase the retiree's compensation after his services to the police department were rendered. The pension fund also claimed that the 1958 amendment to art. II, &sect; 25, was not retroactive, and, therefore, the retrospective provisions of 1959 Wash. Laws 6 and 78 were invalid. The court held that the Acts did not violate Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 25 as amended in 1958 because the statutes were to be read in the light of the constitution at the time the Acts were enacted. The court also held that the 1959 enactments were new and independent acts passed under the 1958 constitutional amendment and had no reference to prior invalid laws. Finally, the court held that the 1958 amendment to Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 25 made the legislative power to increase the retiree's pension unlimited, and the legislature implemented the amendment by back dating the retiree's pension increase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Native American children were enrolled members of the Colville Indian Tribe, and they resided on an Indian allotment to which the United States held title.

On review, relator contended that the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over Indian tribes and enrolled members of tribes, while they were on Indian reservations. The court agreed and held that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction over the children. The court explained that the juvenile court received no jurisdiction by reason of the federal Social Security Act, or by state statutes enacted pursuant to adopting and carrying out the federal social security program. The court held that jurisdiction of the state to inspect for health and educational conditions and enforcing sanitation and quarantine regulations did not confer any jurisdiction upon the juvenile court over the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer submitted to the assessor a list of taxable personal property as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 84.40.040, 84.40.220. The assessor submitted to the board of equalization the assessment sheets. For some reason, there was an error in the assessment. The board met and reevaluated the property. However, because the required notice to the taxpayer as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 84.48.020(3) was not given, the increase in valuation was invalid. The Commission ordered the board to reconvene. Proper notice was given to the taxpayer, and the property was reevaluated. The assessor protested the valuation. The Commission treated this as an appeal and ordered a hearing. A new, higher assessment was made. Whereupon, the taxpayer secured a declaratory judgment that portions of 1939 Wash. Laws 206 were unconstitutional and a refund. The assessor and the Commission appealed. The court held that the Commission had the power to order the board to reconvene, so that the reassessment was valid. However, the informal letter of the assessor did not satisfy the requirements of chapter 206. Therefore the appeal was not properly taken, and subsequent actions by the Commission were invalid.</SPAN></P>

The only potential cognizable issue was a scenario where tobacco brought through mail order and later brought into the state was not subject to the tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The apple growers filed an action for an injunction to prevent the enforcement of Wash. Rev.

The trial court denied the state official's demurrer. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the apple growers' complaint failed to state facts sufficient to show that the challenged statute contravened a provision of the state or federal constitution. The wisdom of the amendment changing the method for grading apples was a matter within the province of the legislature for the protection of the reputation of Washington apples and the betterment of the industry. The statute was a proper exercise of the police power for the general welfare. If the legislature could regulate the marketing of apples, it could refine or change the regulations to further a legitimate purpose. There were no allegations that a legitimate purpose did not exist, nor that the statute was not reasonably calculated to effect that purpose.</SPAN></P>

A search of the truck revealed a flashlight, two .22 caliber rifles, one of which was loaded, a magazine for the unloaded rifle, a hatchet, and a hunting knife. Defendants were then arrested. They were charged in justice court with violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 77.16.050. The justice court found defendants guilty as charged and they appealed to the superior court. At the close of all the evidence, the case was submitted to the jury. Before reaching a verdict, the trial court dismissed the complaints, concluding that &sect; 77.16.050 was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of proof to defendants and compelled defendants to give evidence against themselves. On appeal the court reversed.

Subsequently, an Oregon court discharged the physician from the hospital and declared him to be mentally competent. After a hearing, the board revoked the physician's license to practice medicine. The physician prosecuted an appeal from the board's order and the trial court granted summary judgment to the board. On appeal, the court held that the physician was not automatically entitled to a restoration of his license to practice his profession based on being declared mentally competent. The physician was required to convince the board that he possessed the qualifications prescribed for obtaining a license to practice medicine. The court found that the physician relied solely on the order declaring him mentally competent. He did not testify or produce witnesses to testify as to his mental ability to practice medicine. Therefore, the court concluded that the board was authorized to revoke the physician's license after finding that he had been declared mentally incompetent.</SPAN></P>

Laws 323 established a comprehensive and complete new budget and accounting system for all activities of state government, to provide an efficient, modern system for management of the fiscal affairs of the state. The auditor challenged the constitutionality of the act in six particulars, the principal challenge being that the state auditor would suffer loss of his constitutional powers, duties and prerogatives relating to his functions as general accountant of the state, and in the auditing of all claims of the state payable out of the state treasury, in violation of Wash. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1 and 20. The court examined the deliberations behind the constitution and determined that the establishment of the auditor's office was with the qualification that its continued existence was at the will and the pleasure of the legislature. The court found that Wash. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1 and 20 was not intended as a limitation upon the powers of the legislature. Art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, a public utility district, its commissioners, and elected county officials, sought review of a decision of respondent Superior Court for Thurston County, Washington, which ordered a permanent injunction to halt all proceedings that would result in the levy and spreading of a tax on all taxable property in the district for the purpose of acquiring electrical properties operated by a utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers filed an action that attacked the validity of the purported levy on the ground that the district's proposed budget, as filed, and the published notices of the hearing on the budget were insufficient and deceptive in character. The court noted that the question on appeal was whether there was a substantial compliance with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 54.16.080, which provided the circumstances under which a district could raise revenue by the levy of an annual tax. A notice of the hearing was published in a local newspaper. However, the court concluded that there had been no compliance with &sect; 54.16.080. The notice that was published was misleading because it provided that there would be no funds raised by taxation but then the commissioners voted to raise more than four times the total of its general fund. The court held that budget items could not be raised where the revenue that would make the raise effective must come from a source which the public was advised would not be used. There needed to be good faith and substantial compliance with the statute and because there was no substantial compliance, the trial court was correct in ordering the permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1957 Wash. Laws 265 concerned a mill tax on personal and real property located within the Port.

The taxpayers successfully appealed the judgment and filed a bill of costs. The Attorney General and the county officials filed the motions excepting to the bill of costs. The court granted the motions of exception. The county officers were nominal parties who had not participated in the trial or appeal of this Declaratory Judgment Act action. Therefore under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.24.100, it was not equitable or just to require them to pay costs. The Attorney General was only served with a copy of the proceeding because Wash. Rev.

On defendants' cross-claim, the trial court ordered the chief to repay an overpayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief had been a captain before he was promoted. At the time of his retirement, 1937 Wash. Laws ch. 24, &sect; 1 provided a smaller pension than 1915 Wash. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 2, p. 138, which was in force at the time of his original employment. On appeal, the court noted that it had been previously decided that the position of supervising captain, as established by the ordinances of the city, was a rank as that term was used in both the 1915 and the 1955 acts. Thus, the trial court erred in holding to the contrary and disallowing the chief's pension on the basis of one-half his salary received while he served as a captain. The court held that the three-year statute of limitations of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.080 barred the chief's right of recovery for an increased benefit because the board was not a trustee of an express trust in the administration of the police relief and pension fund. The city had absolute control over the fund with no relation of trust to the fund. Estoppel did not bar the application of &sect; 4.16.080 because respondents did no affirmative act upon which the chief had relied to his detriment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed as to the dismissal of appellant's complaint.

The court held that the practice permitted by the school district of allowing the religious groups to distribute attendance cards and to make announcements relative to the released-time program in the classrooms or on school premises was a use of school facilities supported by public funds for the promotion of a religious program, which contravened Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted by the Superior Court for King County, (Washington), for violating Seattle, Wash., Ordinance no. 40149-9a, making it unlawful for any person to frequent premises where narcotics were unlawfully used, kept, or disposed of, appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he had no knowledge that there were narcotics in the apartment where he was arrested, and that he went to the apartment for the purpose of borrowing money from the tenant. The court held that under the language of the Ordinance, the mailman, the delivery man, the solicitor, the bill collector, the painter and the paperhanger, the carpenter, and the doctor, went upon such premises at their peril, however ignorant they may have been that narcotic drugs were illegally kept, used, or disposed at a particular place. The effect of the ordinance was to create an irrebuttable presumption that any person found in proximity to unlawfully kept narcotic drugs and not carrying with him some official authorization, was guilty of participating in the narcotic traffic. The Ordinance gave defendant no opportunity to exonerate himself, and made his presence upon the premises a crime, regardless of the legitimacy of his errand, unless he could have shown that he was authorized by law to go upon the premises. Finally, the Ordinance went far beyond what was reasonably necessary to achieve its legitimate purpose and constituted an abuse of the police power of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grower contracted with the fruit marketer for the packing and sale of the grower's premium apples. The fruit marketer agreed that the grower's apples would be placed in a pool with other apples of like quality and that the grower would receive the average pool price. The marketer failed to pool the grower's apples and sold them for a lower price. The grower filed an action for breach of contract in which the evidence was highly controverted. The grower prevailed, and the fruit marketer appealed, challenging the trial court's factual findings. The court noted that an appellate court's review of a lower court's factual findings was governed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 44.060, which had been interpreted to mean that unless a factual finding was so clearly unfounded as to have been set aside had it been made by a jury, an appellate court should not disturb it. The court stated that it would not usurp the functions of the jury, or of a judge acting in that capacity, holding that if the evidence on which a judgment was based was competent and legally introduced, and if true would sustain the judgment, an appellate court would not inquire further into its sufficiency.</SPAN></P>

The legislature authorized the toll bridge authority to issue revenue bonds to finance the construction. An appropriations bill authorized the state highway commission to pledge motor fuels tax revenue in the event the toll revenue was insufficient to pay the yearly bond debt. The toll bridge authority sought revenue, but the state auditor refused payment and challenged the constitutionality of such use. The toll authority applied for a writ of mandate. On appeal, the court denied the application and held that the legislature's authorization of the payment of monies for an indefinite time via an appropriations act was unconstitutional because an obligation for an indefinite time was not the proper subject of an appropriations bill, which by its very nature expired at the end of a fiscal biennium. The court noted that the legislature obligation of the tax revenue constituted a provision substantially at variance with the restriction on the source of payment, the appropriations bill, and found it immaterial that the tax revenue was to be repaid eventually by the tolls collected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the customer was denied services at the corporation's salon based on her race, the customer filed a civil suit against the corporation for discrimination. The trial court found that the customer had been discriminated against on account of her race and that the customer's salon was a place of public accommodation. Hence, the trial court entered judgment for the customer, and this appeal followed. The court affirmed the judgment for the customer but remanded the case to the trial court for a reduction of damages. Based on the fact that the customer was told in so many words that she would not be served, the record amply supported the trial court's finding of discrimination. The corporation conceded that its salon was a place of public accommodation within the purview of &sect; 9.91.010. Since no one but the customer and the corporation's employees knew of the discrimination, the effect of the discrimination was purely subjective. There was no finding that the customer suffered any embarrassment, humiliation, mental anguish, or emotional shock. Thus, the trial court's findings did not support the damages awarded. The customer proved no more than nominal damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission ordered the transfer pursuant to the transferor's application, but the trial court reversed on the ground that the permit was dormant. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court should have accorded the Commission's finding of fact the presumptive correctness required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 81.04.430. The court reasoned that the correctness of the trial court's ruling depended upon the single factual question of whether the permit was dormant. The court noted that in the year prior to the filing of the application, the transferor hauled many pounds of bulk cement. Therefore, pursuant to &sect; 81.04.430, the findings by the Commission that the transferor's permit was not dormant should have been accorded a presumption of correctness. The court also determined that the Commission's decision not to take into account the effect of competition on the competitor's businesses was not arbitrary or capricious because the purpose of the Motor Carrier Act was not to prevent competition. As to the competitor's cross-appeal, the court held that the transfer of a part of a permit was lawful pursuant to the Commission's administrative interpretation of the Act.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 53.36.100. The port adopted a resolution which created an industrial development district pursuant to the Industrial Development District Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 53.25.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a tax act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 53.36.100, and the validity of the two-mill tax levy which followed. The tax act provided that the proceeds of the tax had to be used exclusively for the exercise of powers granted to port districts by the Industrial Development District Act. The court ruled that the provisions of the Industrial Development District Act relating to contemplated condemnation of &quot;marginal lands,&quot; as applied to the industrial development district, violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, and were null and void. The provisions of &sect; 10 of the Industrial Development District Act, relating to the condemnation of land other than marginal lands, were also ruled void because they purported to authorize the condemnation of such land for a private purpose, to wit, the development and sale thereof to private entities for use as industrial sites. The court reversed the judgment below and held that, because the proposed condemnation of 700 parcels of land was not for a public use, the proposed use of the proceeds of the two-mill tax levy was not for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered that respondents were enjoined from performing any official act relating to the levy of a two-mill tax on real and personal property for the purpose of the industrial development district created by the port's resolution or from disbursing any taxes collected pursuant to any such levy for the purposes of the industrial development district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and his employer were engaged in extrahazardous industry as classified by the industrial insurance act, when plaintiff was injured in a traffic accident with defendant's truck, which was then being operated by defendant, also in the course of extrahazardous industry. The accident occurred in 1955. Under the statute in force at that time, 1939 Wash. Laws 41, &sect; 2, a person classified as a workman under the industrial insurance act, who, at the time of the accident, was in the course of extrahazardous employment for an employer likewise so engaged, had no cause of action against a tortfeasor or his employee who was likewise engaged in any extrahazardous employment. That proviso was dropped in 1957 Wash. Laws 70, &sect; 23. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's action and on his appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no sign of a legislative intention that the removal of the prior restriction was to be read as rendering anyone liable for an accident occurring before the effective date of &sect; 23. The 1957 amendment affected the right and not just the remedy and therefore was to be applied prospectively only. There was no error.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the decision, the court found that an injunction against the practice of dentistry prohibited the performance of all dental procedures that were designated by statute as the practice of dentistry. Although a portion of the injunction could be surplusage, it did not place an additional burden on the owner. It was a reasonable exercise of the police power for the legislature to provide pursuant to Wash. Rev.

The acts constituting the assault occurred on the Tulalip reservation and the person assaulted was a Native American. The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over defendant's person and the subject matter of the action and held that 1957 Wash. Laws 240 was unconstitutional. The court granted the state's petition for certiorari and rejected defendant's argument that 1957 Wash. Laws 240 violated Wash. Const. art. XXVI. The court ruled that the State of Washington had jurisdiction over defendant on the ground that the requisite &quot;consent of the people&quot; in terms of Wash. Const. art. XXVI could be effectuated by an action of the legislature, and that the legislature spoke for the people of the state when it enacted 1957 Wash. Laws 240. The court noted that, pursuant to the statute, the Tulalip tribe petitioned the governor for placement under state jurisdiction and that the governor proclaimed the assumption of jurisdiction shortly thereafter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former recipients of awards of public assistance, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court for Pierce County, Washington, which sustained a final order of the Department of Public Assistance suspending further awards of public assistance to the recipients because each of the recipients had more than $ 200 on deposit in the bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The money that the recipients had on deposit was derived from an award for personal injuries. The recipients asserted that the cancellation of assistance was not authorized, that the legislative amendment distinguishing an applicant from a recipient as to classification was unconstitutional, and that the money should not be considered a &quot;resource&quot; under the terms of the Public Assistance Act. In affirming, the court agreed with and adopted, so far as material, the trial court's memorandum and opinion. Thus, the court concluded that the legislative amendment to the Act was reasonable, founded on material differences and substantial distinctions which bore a proper relation to the persons dealt with by the legislation and to the purpose sought to be accomplished, and not unconstitutional. Even when a recovery had been made to recipients for pain and suffering, that recovery was a resource as defined by the Act. The definition of resource was plain and unambiguous and was any asset tangible, or intangible, which could be applied toward meeting a recipient's need, either directly or by conversion into money or its equivalent. Thus, the order of suspension of assistance was proper.</SPAN></P>

Laws 377 to be unconstitutional in its entirety and permanently enjoining the state from administering or enforcing any of its provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professors obtained a declaratory judgment that 1955 Wash. Laws 377 was unconstitutional and an injunction against the state officials from requiring them to swear to a loyalty oath in order to keep their positions with the state university in accordance with the act. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, except as to &sect; 3 of the act. The court held that &sect; 3 was unconstitutional because it would adopt findings of the attorney general pursuant to an executive order that had been held unconstitutional and it attempted to adopt future federal regulations by reference. However, the rest of the act was constitutional because the unconstitutional section was separable and the remainder was still workable legislation. It was not an ex post facto law or bill of attainder because there was no punishment for past conduct, only the imposition of qualification for public employment. It did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination because the professors were not compelled to do anything. The oath requirement did not violate the freedom of speech or assembly because the state was permitted to inquire into matters relevant to their fitness for public service.</SPAN></P>

He appealed, and the court found that the proofs of defendant's guilt were overwhelming and amply supported the verdict of guilty. Defendant argued that the variance in the date on the information, which charged the commission of the crime on May 4, and a witness's testimony that the time was 12:07 a.m. on May 5 invalidated the verdict. The court noted that no defense of alibi was made and that defendant's argument overlooked the provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.37.180. Defendant also argued that the State's attorney was guilty of misconduct because he stated in his argument to the jury that all persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether they directly participated or not, were considered participants. The court observed that the attorney was only reading from one of the jury instructions and that Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the policemen had been receiving a disability pension of $ 75 a month since 1938; another, a retirement pension of $ 80.50 since 1939; and, the third, a disability pension of $ 79.31 since 1942. The trial court ordered that their pensions be increased to $ 150 by virtue of 1957 Wash. Laws 84, &sect; 2. The City took the position that the attempt to raise the pension of those whose retirement and disability pay had been fixed at a lesser amount than $ 150, either by the statutes in effect at the time of retirement, or by some earlier statute relied upon by the policemen, could not be increased by a statute enacted after their service had terminated and their retirement or disability pension had been fixed. The court found that the raising of the pensions of the policemen was the granting of extra compensation after the services were rendered. The granting of such extra compensation was prohibited by Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, as it was in 1957. The 1957 legislature could not raise the pensions of those retired or disabled police officers whose pension rates had been fixed by acts in effect at the time of their retirement, or by earlier and more favorable acts.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the 1935 amendment provided no corresponding benefit to the employee to have counterbalanced the loss of pension rights from the imposition of the monetary pension limitation. The amendment, considered as a whole, was clearly detrimental as applied to the foremen and the widow's husbands.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the City of Tacoma and its Fireman's Pension Board, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court for Pierce County, Washington. The trial court declared that plaintiff fireman's rights were determined under 1919 Wash. Laws 196, the firemen's relief and pension act in force when his employment began, and that the 1955 amendment, 1955 Wash. Laws 382, was unconstitutional as applied to the fireman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pension act was amended several times after its enactment. The 1955 amendment required firemen to file an election if they desired to retain their rights under previous pension acts. Both parties mistakenly believed that the fireman had an election between the 1955 amendment and 1935 Wash. Laws 39, and he did not file an election. The Board contended that the 1955 amendment was applicable. On appeal, the court stated that the fireman contracted for a pension plan that was substantially in accord with the plan that existed at the time he accepted employment, and modification of the plan could only have been effected without his consent if the changes were equitable to him. The 1935 act was unconstitutional as applied to the fireman because it limited his pension rights, but he could not have known that at the time he was to have made an election. The court determined that 1929 Wash. Laws 86 was the latest pension act that could be constitutionally applied to the fireman because it would have put him in as good a position relative to his pension rights as he was under the 1919 act. Thus, the fireman had an election between the 1955 amendment and the 1929 act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that the fireman had 60 days after the court's decision to file a written election if he chose to be bound by his pension rights under the applicable 1929 act.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 83.08.030. Respondent, the state tax commission, held that when devisees in the same class inherited different shares of the same total estate, the tax owed was based on the total estate amount and not the individual shares.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A testatrix devised different percentage shares in her estate to her three siblings. The state tax commission imposed a tax on each devisee based on the total amount of the estate. The devisees appealed. They argued that the tax should be imposed on each devisee based on the devisee's percentage share. On appeal, the court construed Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 83.08.030, under which the tax rates increased as the size of the estate increased. The statute placed the devisees in a certain class and imposed the same percentage tax on each of them, regardless of the amount of their share. The court examined the statutory history and concluded that, in amending the statute and including &sect; 83.08.060, the legislature intended to apportion the estate tax among the beneficiaries in each class. Before amendment, there was no need for such a provision, because the tax had been levied on the amount each beneficiary received and not on the total estate passing to a particular class of devisees. The court deferred to the commission's construction of the tax statute and found that the statutory classification scheme did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

However, the city school district's portion of the indebtedness was still on the books. The school district commenced a declaratory judgment action and sought a determination that its bonds were a valid indebtedness. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the school district. The taxpayer sought review. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the consolidation of the school district was constitutional under 1947 Wash.

Laws 214, since the attorney general had refused to do so. The court also held that because the issue raised by the proceeding was not between sovereign states, but one in which the taxpayer questioned the right of the state auditor to transfer funds under the act, federal courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the act. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the state auditor because the legislature did have authority, pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, to enter into the interstate compact provided by 1955 Wash. Laws 214. And, the legislature, in the proper exercise of its discretion, had deemed the benefits received by the reciprocal agreement with its sister states to educate all children residing within its borders to be a sufficient consideration for the funds expended. Thus, the expenditure of funds for such purpose did not constitute the giving or loaning of the credit of this state in violation of Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for Yakima County (Washington) found in favor of respondents and against appellants, the city and an advertising company with whom the city contracted to post the advertising. The city and the advertising company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found no defect in the substance of or the procedure in adopting the ordinance and concomitant contract. Therefore, the court concluded that they were valid. The city charter did not require that the contract with the advertising company be submitted to a vote of the electorate. The court noted that the proportion between the public and the private benefit derived from the use of the advertising was not a determining factor. If the public was benefited in any degree, the use was public, even though the individual who furnished the small benefit to the public may be benefited many times as much as the public. The public might benefit in a number of ways by the ordinance: many of the signs advise or warn the public relative to traffic safety; other signs inform the public as to what products are available, and where; the revenue received by the city will lighten the tax load; and the use of the money for traffic regulation will directly benefit the public. The court rejected the contention that the use of the parking meters for advertising was an unlawful taking of property without compensation because the advertisements were not unreasonable encroachments.</SPAN></P>

The superior court viewed the penalty harsh, but concluded that it had no authority other than to affirm the order. On appeal, the court reversed the superior court's judgment that upheld the order of revocation and remanded the case to the director of licenses for imposition of an appropriate disciplinary penalty. The court held that the penalty imposed had no rational connection with the unprofessional conduct actually proved, the inadvertent hiring of a nonlicensed dentist, and that the penalty assessed was in excess of the Act and contrary to law.

The court dismissed the citizen's appeal upon finding that he did not have standing to challenge the trial court's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition to condemn the landowners' property for the construction of a highway. The superior court initially denied the petition. However, at a second hearing the State provided evidence defining the proposed course of the highway and the general scheme of construction south of the landowners' property. The superior court rendered a decision in favor of the State. On appeal, the court modified the superior court's order by excluding tract A of the property from condemnation. As modified, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no evidence that tract A was necessary for the actual highway construction or maintenance, therefore, it could not be condemned. Tract A was necessary in order to establish a limited access facility for the highway pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.52.050, which was a public use. However, the State had to comply with the procedures set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 47.52.072 - 47.52.075 because tract A abutted already existing highways, which could not be used for a limited access facility until the owners, as indicated in the tax rolls of the county, were given notice of such proposal and an opportunity to be heard thereon.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the challenged statute did no more than provide that the privileges and powers of a municipal corporation should be granted to the inhabitants of a portion of a county not previously incorporated, when they were sufficient in number, and when a requisite percentage of them petitioned for the privilege of becoming incorporated and obtained the consent of the majority in a duly called election, after notice and hearing. The proposal of boundaries by the petitioners was not found to be an exercise of legislative power and the court found no constitutional objection to the fact that the law allowed sparsely populated areas to become incorporated and no unlawful delegation of legislative power.

Const. art. I, &sect; 5 as a prior restraint on the freedom of the press. The act required sellers of comic books to obtain a license, and the act set criminal penalties for noncompliance with the act. The superior court enjoined enforcement of the act because it violated equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court affirmed the injunction against enforcement of the act, holding that the general rule that a legislative act was presumed constitutional did not apply to civil rights cases. The court held that the act was overbroad and devoid of any standards by which the state was to be guided in issuing licenses to sell comic books as required under the act. The act was void on its face because it required a prior license for the sales of all comic books, regardless of their content and the age of the buyer. The act violated the equal protection guarantees because comic sections of newspapers were exempt from the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical disciplinary board issued notice to the physician of a hearing to determine whether his license to practice medicine was to be revoked. In its specification of charges, the board set out the conviction of tax evasion, charged that the offense involved moral turpitude, and charged that it constituted unprofessional conduct within the meaning of the medical disciplinary act. The physician denied that the offense involved moral turpitude or constituted unprofessional conduct. When the hearing committee convened, the chairman announced that it was the opinion of the state attorney general that the offense involved moral turpitude and that the opinion of the attorney general fully settled the question for the board. The chairman specifically foreclosed any hearing on the question. The court upheld the suspension. The method of tax evasion charged in the physician's indictment was that of filing false and fraudulent returns. Thus, the issue of fraud was determined conclusively by his guilty plea. He had no right to a new hearing before the medical disciplinary board as to the presence or absence of moral turpitude, and the summary proceedings by the board were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general asserted that chapter 289 was unconstitutional because it repealed initiative 199 in violation of Wash. Const. amend. 26. The court held that (1) it had jurisdiction to resolve the questions posed in the proceeding; (2) chapter 289 intended to amend initiative 199; (3) the state legislature was authorized, in amending an act, to change the law completely within the subject matter contained in the act; (4) chapter 289 did not violate Wash. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 because art. III, &sect; 3 did not preclude the legislature from redistricting as often as it determined was necessary; and (5) the attorney general had failed to establish that the number of inhabitants in each legislative district and that disproportionateness existed among the districts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition filed in the juvenile court alleging the minor to be a delinquent child came on for hearing. A guardian ad litem was appointed. An attorney was appointed for the probation officer because the prosecuting attorney's office declined a request by the court to represent him. At the hearing before the Superior Court, over the objection of the attorney for relators, the public and the witnesses were excluded from the courtroom. Motions to quash the appointment of the special prosecutor and the guardian ad litem were denied. The Superior Court determined that the boy needed help. When the parents proposed to deal with the boy as they had in the past, the Superior Court committed the boy to a custodial school. The court held that: (1) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.090 did not violate Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and it was proper for the Superior Court to exclude the public from the courtroom; (2) the appointment of the guardian ad litem was proper under Wash. Rev.

In its mandamus action against the city, the religious congregation sought to compel the city to issue the permit. The trial court denied the mandamus, holding that the city's denial of the special use permit was not arbitrary or capricious, was not in derogation of the right of freedom of religion, and did not deny the religious congregation equal protection under the law. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the denial of the special use or zoning permit by the city's board of adjustment was arbitrary and unreasonable because the refusal was not in furtherance of the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community. The court found that the city's administrative determination was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Specifically, there was a lack of substantial evidence to support the city's contention that the proposed church would have caused traffic congestion detrimental to public safety.

Rev. Code &sect; 7.24.020.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.24.010 granted to the city the power to sell the property.

Further, the authority to lease municipally-owned property for the purpose of establishing a parking lot was not conferred upon cities of the third class by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.24.300.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court also restrained the new ordinance from changing the use zone of the district in which the property owners were located from a residential-use district to a commercial-use district. The trial court found that the property owners relied upon the zoning ordinance in existence at the time they purchased their land. The issue for review was whether the city commission could amend the existing zoning ordinance contrary to the recommendation or without the concurrence of the planning commission. On appeal, the court determined that the city had a commission form of government and was governed by the laws applicable to second-class cities. The court determined that pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code 35.23.440 the city was given certain specific powers, the power to zone property within its boundaries not being among these. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.63.120 provided that amendments to the zoning ordinance could be made upon the recommendation of or with the concurrence of the planning commission and that these words could not be disregarded.</SPAN></P>

The second purpose was to provide for the construction of a specific toll road. The court characterized the first purpose as continuing in nature and the second purpose as subject to accomplishment. As such, &sect; 47.59 violated the constitutional prohibition against a bill embracing more than one subject. Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged a judgment of the trial court (Washington), which dismissed the taxpayers' declaratory judgment action against defendants, county assessor, treasurer, auditor, and school districts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the collection of certain taxes. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the taxpayer's complaint and dismissed the action. The taxpayers appealed. The court reversed the judgment of dismissal, remanded the case with instructions to overrule the demurrer, and assessed the costs on appeal against the State. The State challenged the taxation of costs on appeal against it. Upon consideration, the court sustained the State's exceptions and held that no judgment for said costs against the State was to be entered. According to the court, when the State intervened in a declaratory judgment action which attacked the constitutionality of a statute, the State was not liable for court costs. In so holding, the court noted that the right to court costs was a substantive right and a matter of statutory regulation. Just as a sovereign could not be sued without its consent, and then only in the manner and to the extent provided by statute, so also the State was immune from judgment for court costs unless there was express statutory authority permitting such a judgment against it.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. 8370-4 et seq. (Supp. 1943), that was declared unconstitutional. The Washington State Tax Commission had denied most of the refund sought as time barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a foreign corporation, which made wholesale and retail sales to Washington purchasers. The taxpayer made tax payments on its sales under a business and occupation tax for four tax years, which covered the period from 1942 to 1945. The court declared the business and occupation tax unconstitutional in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The taxpayer sought a refund of the taxes paid for the tax years in question from the Washington State Tax Commission on December 31, 1946. The Commission denied the refund application, except for the 1945 taxes, which were paid in January 1946. The taxpayer successfully appealed to the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed. The taxpayer was not entitled to a refund of those taxes for which a refund had been sought more than one year after the taxes were paid under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8370-199 (Supp. 1939). While the provision under which the disputed taxes were collected was declared unconstitutional, the statutory one-year limitations period within which a refund could have been pursued was valid. The statutory refund procedures were fair and did not violate the taxpayer's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought a declaratory judgment, claiming that the transfer of funds from a city street fund to a general fund for purpose of paying a certain death and bodily injury judgment rendered against the municipality was an unconstitutional diversion of tax funds. The judgment against the municipality was based on the negligence of bridge employees. The taxpayer also sought a writ of mandamus to compel the municipality and the officials to reimburse the city street fund. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's action. On appeal, the court determined that the bridge was a part of the state highway system. Since the state director of highways was given the power to determine what streets and bridges within cities and towns would be part of the state highway, the court held that the State assumed the right and obligation to maintain them. The court found that the money in the city street fund was derived from a highway fund and was limited for use for highway purposes. However, since the director was a necessary party, but was not made a party to the action, the court remanded the case so that the director could be made a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside dismissal of the taxpayer's action and remanded with direction to add a director as a party defendant and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was injured when an employer's bus, operated by the employee, allegedly collided with and virtually demolished the driver's truck. At the time of the collision, the driver and the employee were engaged in extrahazardous employment. The employer and the employee contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.010, which stated that no action could be brought against any employer or any workman in the course of any extrahazardous employment, constituted a constitutional bar to the driver's action. The driver contended that the statute placed him in an arbitrary and unreasonable classification. The trial court found that the classification was reasonable. On appeal, the court found that the statute required employers engaged in extrahazardous industry to contribute generally to a state-administered industrial-insurance trust fund. Employees injured in the course of extrahazardous employment were entitled to receive benefits from the fund but were barred from common-law tort actions respecting industrial injuries. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute was constitutional and a bar to the driver's common-law tort action for personal injuries.</SPAN></P>

Laws 290, p. 1287, and an ordinance of the city, which implemented the statute. The statute provided for the establishment of municipal courts in cities having a population of more than 500,000 inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police judge instituted an action seeking both injunctive relief against the enforcement of the statute and the ordinance and for a judicial declaration that the statute and the ordinance were both unconstitutional and void. The statute and ordinance provided that incumbent police judges would be displaced. In addition to attacking the constitutionality of the act, the police judge contended that the statute was not applicable to the city in that the federal census showed the population to be less than 500,000 and no state census had been performed as required by Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. A state census board, however, determined that the population of the city was over 500,000 for purposes of the allocation of state funds. The court held that, where the statute did not define the word census, it was necessary for the court to glean from the statutory language the legislative intent. The court concluded that the legislature intended the statute to be applicable to the city. Finally, the court determined that the police judge failed to show that there was a judicable controversy because he did not allege whether he intended to qualify as a municipal judge under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died testate on October 5, 1953, and his surviving spouse was appointed as executrix. On May 7, 1954, the executrix posted notice, in three public places, of her petition for an award in lieu of homestead. The trial court entered an order setting aside to the executrix in lieu of homestead the property and assets of the estate. After notice of hearing on the final account was given, the heirs objected to the proposed order of account and distribution. The court did not reach the grounds alleged to vacate the award in lieu of homestead because such award was a final order and had become res judicata due to the fact that there was no evidence of fraud on the part of the executrix. The court determined that because the proceeding was in rem, the executrix's notice by posting constituted due notice and had the same effect as actual notice. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in not ordering the filing of a new appraisement of the estate property because there was no competent testimony that the appraisal was too low.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and board of police pension fund commissioners (city), appealed the judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington) that ordered the city to pay plaintiff retired police officer an increased pension in the officer's action to compel the city's payment of the increased amount and to recover for the difference between the increased pension and the pension he had received since retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was employed as a police captain with the city when he retired. When the officer became a member of the department, he was eligible for a pension equal to one-half of the salary attached to the rank held by him for the year preceding his retirement. The contributions were compulsory deductions from the officer's salary. However, the pension fund law was later amended to provide a maximum pension amount. The city was required to deduct only an amount from the salaries that corresponded to the maximum pension amount. The officer filed an action to compel the city to pay him a pension based on one-half of his salary rather that the maximum pension amount in the amended pension law. The officer also sought to recover the difference between the increased pension and the pension that he had received since retirement. The trial court ordered the city to pay the increased pension. The city appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the officer was entitled to the pension amount offered to him when he became a member of the department. The court reasoned that approximately one-third of the officer's benefit had been removed with no corresponding benefit.</SPAN></P>

The automobile possessors appeared specially and moved for dismissal of the action on the ground that, under Wash. Rev.

The trial court orally ruled that it would grant the dismissal. The automobile owners then petitioned for a writ of mandate. The court denied the writ, holding that: (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction to determine the issues involved in the automobile owners' action because &sect; 4.12.010 was a jurisdictional statute, rather than one of venue, and the action was not commenced in the county in which the automobile was located and (2) &sect; 4.12.010 did not violate Wash.

The court concluded that &sect; 9.41.160 made it possible for a prosecuting attorney, in his sole discretion, to charge one who violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.050 with either a misdemeanor or a felony. The court explained that a statute that prescribed different punishments or different degrees of punishment for the same act committed under the same circumstances by persons in like situations was violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court noted that such a statute was violative of Conn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for speeding and tried in a justice court, where he was found guilty.

Defendant filed motions for a dismissal of the action against him, which the trial court denied. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that regardless of the validity of defendant's arrest, it was not error to deny his motions because he entered a plea of not guilty and was in court on the day of the trial. The court held that in using an electromatic speed meter, no factor of the lapsed time of a vehicle while traveling through the measured section of the highway was involved. Thus, the use of such device did not constitute a &quot;speed trap&quot; within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.48.120. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction because there was unchallenged testimony from an officer that defendant was traveling a certain speed and there was testimony that the speed meter could, with reasonable accuracy, measure the speed of a moving vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the lessee's petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although &sect; 8.04.090 was subsequently held to be unconstitutional in an unrelated action, the court held that the trial court's judgment was valid and binding unless regularly reversed or set aside. The parties were not willing to rest their rights upon the settled law regarding the taking of leased property by eminent domain. Therefore, the parties fixed their respective rights by contract. The written lease provided that the taking of all or a portion of the leased property terminated the lease at the option of either party. Therefore, the lease term expired when the taking occurred and the lessor exercised the option, extinguishing any remaining unexpired leasehold to support a compensation claim.</SPAN></P>

The State of Washington, on relation of the Oregon State Highway Commission, filed a complaint against the auditor for writ of mandate in order to compel the auditor to issue warrants. The court granted the writ. The court held that despite the involvement of the State of Oregon, the dispute was not between states but in the nature of an action compelling a state official to perform a duty, which vested original jurisdiction in the Washington Supreme Court. The court further held that there was no impairment of contract arising out of the reimposition of tolls because 1927 Wash.

The act created the WSBFA. The court held that the plan was not a leasing arrangement between landlord and tenant, but an installment purchase by the State of certain buildings and facilities with state moneys raised by taxation, far in excess of the constitutional limitation. The plan was the acquisition by purchase of capital improvements, for which the State could not then pay, and payment for which was therefore to be made in annual installments extended over a period of thirty years.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's complaint alleged that the slash-covered land comprised about 2,639 acres, and that the slash conditions necessitated the fire-fighting expense for which the state sought to hold the corporation accountable. The court reasoned that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the state leave to file a second amended complaint. The court reasoned that the state's motion for leave was made on the basis of newly discovered evidence; yet there was no affidavit as to the materiality of the evidence, or as to whether it could have been discovered earlier with the exercise of due diligence. Therefore, the court held that the only remaining question was the correctness of the trial court's order sustaining the demurrers to the state's first amended complaint. The corporation contended that the statute was unconstitutional because two subjects were embraced by the statute. The court rejected this contention, holding that all matters which were naturally and reasonably connected with the statute's purpose, and all measures which would, or could, facilitate the accomplishment of the purpose so stated, and were germane, were properly included in the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the state's complaint that sought to recover forest fire-fighting costs against the corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff relator and defendant justices of the peace were granted a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Superior Court for Kitsap County, Washington, which declared that certain portions of 1951 Wash. Laws ch. 156 were unconstitutional, but the remaining portions of that act and 1951 Wash. Laws ch. 74 were constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acts at issue required justices of the peace to be attorneys at law, that they devote their full time to their offices, and that, for certain cities, counties pay a portion of their salaries. Claiming that it was a county affected by the acts and that the acts would cost it large and unnecessary expenses, the relator sued, seeking declarations that justices of the peace need not be attorneys and that they need not serve full-time. Relief was granted in part. In reversing on review, the court ruled that there was no justiciable controversy between the parties and the relator lacked standing because it did not infringe upon any constitutional right of the relator. Legislative authority over counties, such as the relator, was limited only by the state constitution, and the legislative direction that counties pay a portion of the salaries afforded no basis for an attack on the constitutionality of 1951 Wash. Laws ch. 156. Also, it being apparent that the principal object of all parties in the action was to obtain an adjudication as to the validity of the acts, there was no actual, existing justiciable controversy between parties having opposing interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with directions to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

Laws 287 (the Act), which provided for regulation and conservation of the salmon industry, was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fishermen sought an injunction against enforcement of the Act upon the ground that it was unconstitutional and that much of the authority granted to the director constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power. Alternatively, the fishermen sought declaratory judgment adjudicating the Act void. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the fishermen's second amended complaint and dismissed the action. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Regulation and conservation of the salmon industry, as defined in the Act, promoted the good order and welfare of the people, and hence were clearly within the police power of the state. The Act did not constitute class legislation and was not discriminatory because all who came within the provisions of the statutes were equally affected thereby. The Act did not unlawfully delegate legislative power to the director because the delegated authority was simply ministerial. The Act did not abridge the fishermen's rights under the due process and privileges and immunity clauses of the state and federal constitutions because those provisions did not apply to laws enacted by the state legislature in the exercise of its police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition, the attorney general alleged that the prerequisites to the issuing of the warrant had been satisfied. The attorney general further alleged that the state auditor's refusal to issue the warrant prevented the State from taking immediate possession of the property and jeopardized the progress of the state highway program. The state auditor asserted that &sect; 8.04.090 was unconstitutional. The court denied the petition for the writ of mandate, holding that &sect; 8.04.090 was unconstitutional in that it denied a landowner the right to a judicial determination of just compensation and payment and the right to a jury trial as set forth in Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, amend. IX. The court held that under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, amend. IX, the landowner was entitled to payment before the State could take possession of the property under the power of eminent domain. Thus, because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 8.04.090 provided for the delivery of the warrant in the amount last offered to the landowner to the court clerk without any judicial determination as to the justness of the compensation prior to the State's taking, the landowner was denied his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

As a result, the firemen sought to obtain a writ of mandate from the trial court. However, the trial court sustained a demurrer to the petition, in part, on the ground that the initiative charter amendment was unconstitutional as being an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the firemen's action after determining that a legislative body could not abdicate its responsibility and turn it over to a board of arbitrators whose decision would have been binding on both parties. Specifically, the court held that the city council had no right to abdicate its authority under the &quot;Home Rule&quot; provision of Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 10.

The court affirmed the judgment against the taxpayer. The court determined that the taxpayer's interstate wholesaling activity was not taxable under Wash. Rev.

The State contended that the candidate was not qualified for the position because he was not a lawyer, and 1951 Wash. Laws ch. 156, &sect; 2, required that a justice of the peace was a lawyer. The trial judge refused to grant the writ of prohibition, ruling that 1951 Wash. Laws ch. 156, &sect; 2 and 1951 Wash. Laws ch. 74 were unconstitutional. The State's writ of certiorari was heard before five members of the court, who were not unanimous in their views as to the statutes' constitutionality. Consequently, the issue was not to have been determined except after an En Banc hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington) in favor of defendant, dismissing the complaint in an action upon a marine insurance policy and enjoining plaintiff from attempting to enforce a Delaware judgment, the basis being that it was void for lack of jurisdiction over defendant and over the subject matter of that action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a seaman, was injured by a fall into a manhole because the cover was removed by personnel to gain access to machinery. Plaintiff's injury was covered by a policy of marine insurance issued by defendant in California. A Delaware court issued a default judgment. Plaintiff then filed that judgment in Washington and sought to enforce it. Lower court dismissed for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction; plaintiff appealed. The court reversed because plaintiff's complaint was sufficient to raise the issue of unseaworthiness under the maritime law, thus subject matter jurisdiction was not dependent solely upon the provisions of the Jones act and should not have been dismissed due to Jones act's statute of limitations. Moreover, plaintiff could maintain an action against a dissolved corporation and had a right to assume that no issue was being raised as to personal jurisdiction over the dissolved Delaware corporation because objections were not raised. Finally, the policy was a marine insurance policy and was a maritime contract which was controlled by California law because that was where contract was entered into, which was entitled to full faith and credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of dismissal was reversed and the case remanded because the Delaware judgment was entitled to full faith and credit and that, under the California law applicable to the contract of insurance, plaintiff was entitled to maintain an action thereon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators sought to restrain the auditor from placing respondent candidates' names on the ballot as justice of the peace candidates. Relators also argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 3.12.021, which allowed the county commissioners to reduce the number of justices of peace to one, was unconstitutional. However, relators argued, and respondents disputed, that the section allowing the reduction of justices to one was severable from the remaining portion of the statute, which established two justices of the peace. The court granted relators' request for the writ of prohibition. The section limiting the number of justices was severable because it did not affect the remaining provisions of the statute. The court found that the filing fees paid by respondent candidates was inadequate and thus they were not entitled to have their names placed on the ballot. The court held that it was required to act because to do otherwise would disregard the responsibility relative to the protection and orderly conduct of elections tendered to the court by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers sought to compel respondents to move the offices of their agencies from Seattle to Olympia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Washington's seat of government was located at Olympia in 1890 and no subsequent election authorized its removal. Thirteen state agencies had no office located in Olympia. The taxpayers sought a writ of mandate to compel respondents to move the offices to Olympia. The trial court granted a preliminary writ of mandate. On appeal, the court modified the order of the trial court to dismiss the governor as a party, and as so modified, affirmed the order. The court determined that the taxpayers had standing to bring the action, that the state courts had jurisdiction over the subject matter of actions involving the location of the state seat of government, and that the controversy could be completely disposed of without the presence of the governor. The court rejected respondents' contention that the state constitution required only the executive officers named in the constitution to maintain their offices in the capital, and concluded that Wash. Const. art. III, &sect; 24, and art. XIV, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, required that all of the state executive offices be maintained there. The court noted that the citizens of the state could amend such a provision by majority vote if they so desired.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the amendment left no room for the applicability of the doctrine of permissive delegation of legislative authority. The court affirmed the unconstitutionality of the statute. The court concluded that the legislature would not have passed Wash. Rev.

The Department sought review by the trial court. The employee filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The trial court granted the motion. The Department sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that the only issue on appeal was whether the Department was given a right to appeal an adverse determination by the Board. The court found three statutes that discussed who was entitled to appeal to the trial court from an adverse Board decision. Two of the three, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 51.52.050 and .060, spoke of a workman, beneficiary, employer, or other person aggrieved. The third section spoke only of any other person aggrieved. The court concluded that this phrase did not include the Department.

The employer appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington) upon the verdict of a jury, which increased the award made by the department to plaintiff. Plaintiff had challenged the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code ch. 51.52.115 (1951).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured the course of his extrahazardous employment. The board of industrial insurance appeals sustained an order awarding plaintiff compensation based on a permanent partial disability equivalent to 25 percent of the maximum allowable for unspecified disability. On appeal, the jury increased the award and found that plaintiff suffered a 35 percent disability. The employer appealed. The sole question was whether Wash. Rev. Code ch. 51.52.115 (1951), which provided for a review of decisions of the board of industrial insurance appeals by a trial de novo in the superior court, was unconstitutional as an attempt to delegate to the judiciary a purely legislative or administrative function. The court affirmed because the board's functions were essentially or primarily judicial; thus, the statute giving the district court authority to try the case de novo on the facts and law was constitutional, and the trial court did not err in denying the employer's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The trial court did not err in giving the challenged instruction or in refusing to give the instruction proposed by the employer.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the joint purchase arrangement did not require prior approval and was executed pursuant to a valid assignment of rights as to electric utility distribution properties that did not violate a temporary restraining order. The latter precluded the public utility from entering into the plan, but it did not preclude its assignment of rights to the intervenor utility districts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the legislature's declaration of emergency was valid with the result that the right of referendum was thereby cut off. The court held that legislative declaration of emergency for an enactment was conclusive and had to be given effect, unless the declaration on its face was obviously false. The court must give the legislature and its declaration of an emergency every favorable presumption. The legislation's declaration, concerned fraud in public welfare, was sought to be accomplished by providing for publicity, both before and after death of the welfare recipient, as to the identity of those persons who were or had been receiving public welfare assistance. Presumably, the effect of those provisions was to minimize serious abuses in administering the act and to limit grants thereunder to qualified applicants and recipients who were rightfully entitled to them. The court upheld the sufficiency of the legislative emergency declaration. The declaration was necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions and there was no reasonable basis for overturning that presumption.</SPAN></P>

The lot owners relied on a statute providing that, under certain conditions, a county road that had been authorized yet remained unopened for public use for the space of five years, could be vacated. The trial court entered judgments for the county and the lot owners appealed. The court affirmed and found that a 1909 amendment to the statute, excluding dedicated streets, applied to the street in question. The court held that the lot owners' rights to automatic vacation of the street were not vested rights that would prohibit a retroactive application of the amendment, but were only a possibility of reverter. The court further held that neither the construction of improvements nor the payment of taxes by the abutting lot owners could give them title by adverse possession to the county's easement in a dedicated street. Finally, the court ruled that the amendment did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general had held that operating a bottle club was lawful before the enactment of &sect; 2, which made it a gross misdemeanor unless the operator had a license issued by the Washington State Liquor Control Board. The superior court upheld the constitutionality of the act. Reversing, the court said that &sect; 2 violated the Due Process Clauses of the U.S. and Washington constitutions. By making operation of a bottle club without a license a gross misdemeanor without making a provision for licensing, the Washington legislature denied the bottle clubs due process of law. The second paragraph of &sect; 2 was void because it was vague, uncertain, indefinite, and unintelligible and contained no standards for determining under what circumstances the Board could grant or deny an applicant a bottle club license. The legislature could have prohibited the operation of bottle clubs entirely or could have regulated their operation, but it could not require, as a condition precedent to their lawful operation, the issuance by the Board of a license that was nonexistent and unobtainable. An attempt to do so in the second paragraph of &sect; 2 violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 9.41.040 was constitutional, noting that the State was required to prove the inmate's prior offense in order to obtain a conviction and that it was not error for the State to inform the jury that the evidence included proof of the prior offense.

In affirming the decision, the court found that the fireman could not be discharged for having moved his residence beyond the city limits pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.200. The statute authorized the city to enact residence qualifications by any ordinance that did not conflict with its charter, but it forbade the city from discharging a civil service employee, otherwise qualified, upon the sole ground that he has moved beyond the corporate limits.

The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in directing the prosecutor to initiate the quo warranto proceedings, and that the corporation acquired no immunity by reason of the presumption of constitutionality that was accorded statutes such as Chapter 119. The court further held that the slot machines were mechanical lotteries. The court held that the intention of Wash. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the judgment from the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which sustained a demurrer to the taxpayer's complaint against respondents, a county treasurer and an auditor, for declaratory and injunctive relief attacking the real estate sales tax under 1951 Wash. Laws ch. 11, p. 108. The superior court dismissed the action for the failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute authorized each county, at its option, to enact the tax. The county in question chose to do so. The taxpayer contended that the tax was one on property rather than an excise or sales tax. Further, the tax was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court held that the tax was a valid sales tax. In part, it was a tax on the incidents of ownership, not the ownership itself, and did not have to be apportioned. Therefore, any arguments concerning the validity of property taxes were not on point. Because the tax was within the valid powers of the state, the state could also have delegated the authority to impose the tax on local governments. The provisions of the tax setting the rate did not violate the rule that a title to an act was defective if more than one subject was included in the text. Stated differently, the tax was not a general revenue raising measure. A county resolution that no sale could be accepted by the auditor until the tax was paid was not unlawful because it violated a recording act. Even if it were, subsequent legislation rendered the resolution valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's suit.</SPAN></P>

The mother caused a writ of execution to be issued against defendant's property. The father sought to enjoin such action. The court reversed the contempt order against the mother, finding that although both parties' actions were contemptuous, the trial court had no authority to make such an adjudication because no contempt proceeding was before it and the contempt in question was not committed in its presence. The trial court was without power to enter the order restraining the mother from continuing the execution proceedings to collect child support arrearage or instituting a proceeding to collect the balance of the property settlement because her rights thereto became absolute and fixed at the time provided in the decree for their payment. The provisions denying enforcement rights and interest and permitting monthly payment on the arrearage constituted an impermissible modification of the interlocutory order.

The court held that in the relationship and course of conduct pursued by respondents, there were present all three elements necessary to establishment of a monopoly within the meaning of Wash. Const. art. XII, &sect; 22. Respondents were acting in violation of the anti-monopoly provision of the constitution. Respondents were enjoined from any further course of conduct or activities that would restrain competition against appellants.

The issue raised was whether defendant could secure a discharge from the criminally insane ward at the penitentiary under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2176(b) (Remington 1907). The court found that &sect; 2176(b) did not have application to an individual who was sane at the time of trial and at the time of commitment, but was committed because the jury found that there was such likelihood of a recurrence or relapse as to render him unsafe to be at large. It was ruled that defendant, by the very circumstance of being adjudicated to be sane at the time of his commitment, could not bring himself within the terms of Wash. Rev.

Thus, the court held that &sect; 6970 had no application to persons seeking release under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2176(b) (Remington 1907).

The court found that, in order to charge the employee with the assumption of risk attributable to a defect due to the employer's negligence, it should have appeared not only that the employee knew of the defect but also that he knew that it endangered his safety. The court determined that the evidence failed to prove that the employee knew that the unguarded moving gears endangered his safety or that such danger was so obvious that an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances would have appreciated the danger. The court further found that the employee had not been warned of the danger. The court held that the employee had not assumed the risk and that the employer was liable to the employee.

The Director sought a writ of mandamus commanding the Committee issue and sell bonds to finance the construction. The court granted the writ, holding that the Act conformed to the provisions of Wash.

The court held that the title of the Act was a general title which was broad and comprehensive enough to embrace the selling of the bonds to finance the construction. The court held that thus the Act did not violate Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 because the title gave such notice as should reasonably lead to inquiry into the body of the act itself, and indicated to an inquiring mind its scope and purpose. The court held that because the bonds to be issued pursuant to the Act were for highway purposes, their issuance and sale did not offend Wash. Const. amend. 18. The court held that indebtedness incurred for highway purposes, to be paid out of a fund protected from invasion from any other use than highway purposes, was not a &quot;debt&quot; contemplated by Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sixth grade students had raised the backstop to keep the ball from going beyond the catcher during recess. When the child proceeded past it, the backstop suddenly collapsed and fell on him, causing serious injuries. The school district contended that the action was barred by Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4706 and assigned as error several of the trial court's rulings. The guardian asserted that &sect; 4706 did not apply because the backstop was not an athletic apparatus or appliance within the meaning of the statute and that, even if it were, the injury did not occur upon the backstop and in its use by the child. The court reversed and remanded with instruction to the trial court to dismiss the action. The court held that the backstop was equipment pertaining to the activities of those engaged in physical training or exercise and was more or less permanently located equipment. Thus, the backstop constituted an athletic apparatus or appliance under &sect; 4706, and the school district was exonerated from liability. Also, the accident related to the backstop; therefore, it was not relevant that the child was not actually on or using the backstop. It was unnecessary to consider the assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission assessed taxes on classes of sales a corporation made in the State of Washington pursuant to Wash.

That decision was affirmed by the court for the most part, although it found that two of the disputed classes of sales were not taxable. Under &sect;&sect; 8370-4(6), persons taxed as wholesalers could not also be taxed as manufacturers. In other words, local manufacturer-wholesalers were exempt from &sect;&sect; 8370-4 as manufacturers. The corporation engaged in selling but not manufacturing n the State of Washington and could not complain that &sect;&sect; 8370-4 discriminated against manufacturers. Although the corporation asserted that &sect;&sect; 8370-4 was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause in that it imposed an unfair burden on interstate commerce, the court disagreed. The court held that a corporation could not channel business through a local outlet to gain the advantage of a local business and also hold the immunities of an interstate business. It noted that sales sent directly to out-of state offices without local intervention were not taxable under &sect;&sect; 8370-4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city argued that the appeal should have been dismissed because of the driver's alleged noncompliance with Wash. Sup. Ct. R. 12 (1) (a) and (b), which required notice of appeal in criminal cases to be given in open court or by a writing served upon the prevailing party and timely filed in the office of the clerk. The clerk certified a copy of the judge's order of dismissal of the appeal, which noted that the driver gave notice of appeal in open court. The court found that there was sufficient compliance with the rule. The city also argued that the driver failed to comply with the requirement of Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8993-1 that he note a case for trial within 10 days of filing his transcript. The court agreed. The driver argued that the statute was unconstitutional because the act was amended by mere reference to its title. The court found that the act was supplementary, rather than amendatory in character. The act did not change, piecemeal, any existing statute, but instead was a complete new act dealing with one specific subject; the necessary procedural steps involved in an appeal from a judgment of a police court. The act did not violate Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 37.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city, its mayor and its chief of police, sought review of a decision by the Superior Court for Mason County, Washington, which issued an injunction restraining them from arresting appellee veteran for peddling goods without a license. The veteran had a peddler's license from another city under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10755, 10756 (Remington), which exempted veterans from the payment of peddler's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented was whether &sect;&sect; 10755, 10756 violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and the Equal Rights Clause. The trial court held that none of the licensing provisions of the Shelton, Wash., Peddling Ordinance (Ordinance) had any application, and that the veteran did not need to apply to the city for a license, or post a bond, pay a license fee, or do anything required by the Ordinance. The court held that: (1) the city was excepted from Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8355 (Remington) because it had its own regulatory ordinance; (2) the only basis on which even a plausible argument could be made for the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 10755, 10756 was that the license fees referred to therein constituted a tax and did no more than exempt all veterans from the payment of such taxes; (3) an exemption for peddlers based upon previous military service would be on the same basis, from the standpoint of logical relationship, as an exemption based on the color of hair or eyes; (4) &sect;&sect; 10755, 10756 were unconstitutional; and (5) as a result the city and its officers could not be enjoined from enforcing the Ordinance merely because the veteran had a license issued under &sect;&sect; 10755, 10756.</SPAN></P>

The county sought to enjoin the cab company from picking up passengers at the Seattle-Tacoma airport without a county license to do so and it challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Revised Airports Act, Wash. Comp. Stat. &sect; 2722-30 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airport manager received numerous complaints as to discourteous treatment of passengers by cab drivers, improper maintenance of equipment, and overcharges. The port authority decided to enter into a temporary agreement with a responsible company to furnish exclusive taxicab service at the airport. The cab company entered into that agreement with the port authority. The cab company was licensed as such in the city where the airport was located, but not in the county. The county challenged the arrangement between the cab company and the port authority. The trial court dismissed the county's action, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the county had failed to show that any legal right had been or was about to be invaded that would entitle it to an injunction. The court noted that if any party had been harmed by the exclusive agreement, it was other taxicab operators, none of whom were parties to the action. The court found that Wash. Comp. Stat. &sect; 2722-44, regarding the power to assess license fees for operations on airport grounds, was constitutional and that the county therefore did not have the power to license any taxicabs operating at the airport.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was also charged with placing an infant in a family home for adoption prior to the time an order of relinquishment had become final. The trial court dismissed the prosecution. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the power that 1933 Wash. Laws 172 attempted to confer upon the social security director with respect to the issuance of certificates of approval was, by reason of the failure of the legislature to set up proper standards and guides to indicate the extent and limits of the director's discretion, an arbitrary, unlimited, and unconstitutional delegation of the legislative function. Chapter 172 unlawfully delegated legislative power to the director of business control, and that power had by subsequent amendments been transferred to the social security director. The court ruled that a law was invalid when the authority delegated left the regulatory or enforcement agency with unguided and unrestricted discretion in the assigned field.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with violating Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2338. His demurrer to the information was overruled and various motions, including motions for dismissal and directed verdict of acquittal, were denied. The jury returned a guilty verdict and the superior court denied his motion for a new trial or arrest of judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant's assertion that the committee's investigation violated his free speech right was without merit because the right of free speech was not absolute and yielded to national interests. Defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 was not violated because there was no real danger of prosecution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were co-partners in a company that owned and operated dental offices.

The State also alleged that the dentists aided and abetted the owners. At the close of evidence, the trial court dismissed the action against the first dentist on the ground of insufficient evidence. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the owners and the second dentist on the ground that State v. Brown, 37 Wash. 97, established the unconstitutionality of &sect; 10031(6). The court expressly overruled State v. Brown, and it reversed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with arson in the first degree after he was observed exiting the store, which was on fire at the time. The jury returned a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot; of the crime of arson in the first degree but ''guilty&quot; of the crime of attempt to commit arson. He was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. On appeal, the court held that questioning of one of the State's principal witnesses in the absence of defendant while the jury was viewing the premises involved in the case denied defendant his constitutional right to be confronted by witnesses and was improper. Further, a prejudicial error occurred when an objection to a question by the prosecuting attorney was sustained and the jury was instructed to disregard the question, but defendant was subsequently asked the question on cross-examination and was compelled to answer it. Consequently, the jury's mind was left with an implication that the trouble which defendant was compelled to admit having gotten into was the same transaction about which he was asked and to which an objection was sustained. The court also found that the maximum sentence of 20 years was proper for the conviction for attempted arson in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Property deemed a public park was conveyed to trustees who managed park affairs. The county commissioners never assumed jurisdiction or control. With court approval, the park was conveyed to a library group, which contracted with two men to do selective logging. The contract was approved by the court. The prosecutor received several protests about the logging operations. Finding that the park was dedicated to the public forever, had never been vacated, and county commissioners had never authorized any logging, he notified the loggers to cease. When they continued, warrants were issued for trespassing. The library group and loggers sought a temporary restraining order to keep the prosecutor from pursuing the charges. The lower court entered a temporary and then a permanent restraining order against the prosecutor. The court issued a writ of prohibition to the lower court, to prevent it from enforcing its injunction. No irreparable injury had been shown. The threatened injury to property rights had to be one which naturally and necessarily followed the threatened enforcement of the law, and not a loss arising merely from the arrest and prosecution of the party threatened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ of prohibition was issued to the lower court.

Prior to trial, the husband filed an amended answer setting up a cross-complaint for divorce on grounds of cruel treatment and embarrassment and the husband contended the superior court erred in denying his motion to file the amended answer at the commencement and at the close of trial. The superior court denied the wife the divorce and she did not appeal the decision. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment denying the husband's motion for leave to file an amended answer setting a cross-complaint for divorce and concluded the superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions. The court found the husband's motion for leave to file amended pleadings was not timely made since nine months had passed since the original answer was filed. Also, the court found no evidence of a purported agreement between the parties' attorneys to allow the husband to file the amended pleading.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted an injunction. Appellants sought review of the order. Respondent argued that the act violated the state constitution by funding interest on state bonds issued provided as a bonus to veterans a bonus through an excise tax on cigarettes. The court reversed, holding that the state legislature acted within its authority when it provided that the funds raised by the tax imposed on cigarettes by the session laws should be used to redeem the bonds authorized by those session laws. The court noted that the funds raised by the sale of bonds were not to be given away, but were to be paid for services rendered. Thus, the constitutional prohibition against making a loan was not violated. In addition, it was within the discretion of the state legislature to impose a tax upon cigarettes without imposing a tax upon other tobacco products.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance No. 1110 required itinerant photographers to be licensed by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The photographer's principal place of business was in Yakima, and in other cities and towns he employed agents who would go from house to house and from business to business soliciting orders for finished photographs. The sittings would take place in a local temporary place of business, and the printing and finishing would be done in Yakima. The trial court found only Ordinance No. 1110, &sect; 1, para. 2(2) unconstitutional and dismissed the complaint. The court reversed, however, finding first that, by requiring license fees of those photographers who were nonresidents of Wenatchee only, Ordinance No. 1110, &sect; 2, pts. (A) and (B) discriminated unreasonably against them, a violation of U.S. Const. amend. 14 and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12(2). Second, Wenatchee, Wash., Ordinance No. 1110, &sect; 6 was unconstitutional in that its effect was substantially to prohibit the activity of nonresident photographers in Wenatchee. It was apparent that the primary purpose of &sect; 6 was to protect local photographers from lawful competition and was thereby designed to serve private interests in contravention of common rights. It was therefore an unreasonable and unlawful abuse of the police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to enjoin the city of Wenatchee from attempting to enforce the ordinance against the photographer, his agents, solicitors, and employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Senate passed a bill repealing and adding sections of the then-existing unemployment compensation statute. A referendum was certified regarding the additions, and they were to go onto the general election ballot. The employee filed an action against his employer, the State, and others, alleging that the employer threatened to deduct from his wages money to pay into the disability compensation fund as provided by the section of the statute that was yet to be voted on by the public. The trial court overruled the State's demurrers and granted the declaratory relief prayed for by the employee and by the employer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the declaratory relief sought by the employee and awarded by the trial court was permissible under the declaratory judgment act. The act empowered courts to declare a statute unconstitutional, even though the statute might not yet be in effect, if a plaintiff alleged that he was to be directly damaged by its enforcement, that the State was charged with the duty of enforcing it and was about to enforce it, and that such endorsement would result in the infringement of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The state, on behalf of the water company, filed a writ of certiorari to review the trial court's order. The court determined that the Act recognized the independence of the states from the domination or encroachment of the federal government. The court held that the district was authorized under the Act to take over and maintain land necessary for the dispensation of utility power. The court found that the district had the authority to take the water company's land with just compensation and further determined that, since such land was not owned by the United States, the United States was not a necessary party to the action.

The corporation argued that the president's order was entered without constitutional or statutory authority and was void. The court granted the writ of certiorari and vacated the order. While the retired judge could be selected by agreement of the parties to act as a judge pro tempore to preside at a trial under the state constitution, the court also found the Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11054-1 et seq. (Remington Supp.) required that retired judges perform certain duties only if called upon to do so and those duties did not violate any constitutional provision. The court held that Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11054-4 (Remington Supp.) was unconstitutional because it gave the president the power to endow the retired judge with an office that he had relinquished and to increase the number of active superior court judges beyond the statutory number as fixed by the legislature.

Appellants sought review after the superior court sustained the attorney general's demurrers. The court assumed that appellants were entitled to maintain their action because the issue directly affected the interests of the general public and raised a constitutional issue. The court ruled that initiative 171 was legally enacted and that appellants' constitutional rights were not violated. The court found that the secretary of state failed transmit by mail a pamphlet in compliance with 1913 Wash. Laws ch. 138, &sect;&sect;27, 29. However, the court held that respondents' admission that the pamphlet was not mailed could not be considered by the court because initiative 171 was adopted and enacted, thus the court had to conclusively presume that the secretary of state complied with the law. The ballot titles were not defective and related to the control and regulation of intoxicating liquors. Initiative 171 did not unlawfully delegate legislative authority to the liquor control board because it provided a sufficient standard to guide the board in issuing the licenses.</SPAN></P>
