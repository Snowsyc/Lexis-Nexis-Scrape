</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which convicted him on a charge of manufacturing cannabis. Appellant argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the marijuana evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to suppress was denied by the court below, appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of manufacturing cannabis. The facts showed that two uniformed sheriff's deputies went to appellant's home to talk about misdemeanors that had previously occurred. One deputy went into the fenced backyard and there observed (1) marijuana plants growing near a shed and (2) other marijuana plants growing in pots inside the house in the dining room window. The other deputy went to the front door, knocked, and was invited to enter. Once inside, he saw the plants on the windowsill and recognized them as marijuana. All the plants were then seized. The lower court's judgment and sentence were affirmed on appeal, even though the activities of the first deputy may have been unconstitutional, because the first officer's actions in no way altered the fact that the plants inside the house were in plain view of the deputy who was lawfully invited to enter. The court noted that even if the plants taken from the backyard should have been suppressed, that any error in that regard was harmless because that evidence was merely cumulative and clearly unnecessary to the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for manufacturing cannabis was affirmed. Even though the court found that it was possible that the court below should have suppressed marijuana evidence obtained by a police officer from appellant's back yard, the court found that any error in that regard was harmless because that evidence was merely cumulative to plain view evidence that another officer seized following his lawful invitation into appellant's home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of the circuit court judgment that dismissed their complaint against appellees, state and several state agencies, which alleged that the actions of the appellee administrative agency constituted an inverse condemnation. Appellant's prior petition for review of appellee administrative agency's action had been denied in an opinion issued by the First District Court of Appeal. The circuit court held that appellants' complaint was attacking the constitutionality of the agency action rather than attacking the constitutionality of the law under which the agency acted, and that the doctrine of res judicata barred appellants' action. Appellants argued that they were not trying to void appellee administrative agency's action but were seeking compensation for the taking. The court held that appellants could have made the same contention in the administrative proceeding, and the First District Court of Appeal could have required that any taking be compensated, but the fact that they did not was irrelevant to the application of res judicata. The court held that appellants were bound by the final determination of the First District Court of Appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both sides appealed the orders of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) which found that Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(6) (1979) was constitutional and that appellee commission had denied appellant city commissioner's due process rights in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313 (6) (1979) was constitutional in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief. The legislature had repealed that part of Fla. Stat. ch. 112.317 (1973) which made a violation of ch. 112.313 a criminal offense, thus, ch. 112.313 could have been held to a lesser standard of definiteness. The addition of the word &quot;corruptly&quot; to ch. 112.313 so limited the term &quot;special privileges or exemptions,&quot; that the statute conveyed a sufficiently definite warning of forbidden conduct to a person of common understanding. The court reversed the ruling that appellee commission's procedures for determining probable cause were inadequate to provide appellant city commissioner with due process of law because the proceedings were investigatory, not adjudicatory, in nature and appellant could have requested a public hearing following a determination of probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order that Fla. Sta. ch. 112.313(6) (1979) was constitutional was affirmed because the statute was not impermissibly vague. The court reversed and remanded the order striking appellee commission's finding of probable cause because appellant city commissioner was not denied due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardian challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which held that appellee natural son was an heir of his natural father and that his subsequent adoption did not deprive appellee of his right to share in the estate of his natural father with appellant's child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee natural son filed a petition for determination of heirs in which he sought to be declared an heir of his natural father who died intestate. Before intestate's death, appellee was adopted. The trial court held that appellee acquired the right to be an heir of his natural father at birth and that his subsequent adoption did not deprive him of that right. The trial court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 732.108 (1979), which terminated the legal relationship between appellee and his natural father, was unconstitutional if it deprived appellee of his right to share in the estate of his natural father. The court reversed the trial court. According to the court, a child only had an expectancy at birth that he would be an heir of his natural father. The intestate's death vested an heir's right to intestate property pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 732.101(2) (1979). The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 63.172, 732.108 (1979) did not deprive appellee of any vested rights because the right to inherit did not vest until the death of intestate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for appellee state attorney. On appeal the court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), that entered judgment that appellee insured was entitled to recover full amount of uninsured motorist's coverage after stacking and denied appellant's claim for a set off of worker's compensation benefits awarded to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured had automobile coverage through appellant insurer. Appellee was notified by appellant that a change in the law required uninsured motorist coverage be maintained in the same amount as the bodily injury coverage unless expressly waived. Appellee waived that requirement and kept his insurance policy at $ 100,000/$ 300,000 for bodily injury and $ 15,000/$ 30,000 for uninsured motorist coverage. Appellee deleted one car and added a new one to the policy. Two days later, appellee was involved in an accident and filed a claim under his uninsured motorist policy for the maximum $ 200,000 contending that he was entitled to the full coverage since he did not expressly waive it when the policy was changed. The trial court agreed and awarded appellee the maximum coverage after the stacking of policies. The court reversed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727(1) (1976), holding that a material change did not occur and the policy change was a renewal. Appellee was only entitled to $ 30,000, the amount of the uninsured motorist coverage under the renewed policy. Appellant was also entitled to a setoff for worker's compensation benefits paid to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded, finding that a new waiver of uninsured motorist coverage was not required where appellee insured's addition of a vehicle to the policy was a substitution and not a material change that would have allowed appellee to recover the maximum allowed after stacking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Palm Beach County (Florida) that granted defendants' motion to suppress physical evidence and statements secured as a result of the arrest of defendants in their home without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon probable cause, a detective went to defendants' house trailer for the purpose of arresting them for robbery. Although there was time to secure a warrant, the detective did not secure one. At the time of the arrest, state law provided warrantless arrest of a person at his home was authorized based upon probable cause alone. Before the prosecution of defendants began, the U.S. Supreme Court held that such warrantless arrests were prohibited absent exigent circumstances. Once the prosecution brought charges against defendants, they filed a motion to suppress evidence and statements secured as a result of the arrest. The trial court granted the motion, concluding the intervening decision required suppression. The trial court also found Fla. Stat. ch. 901.15 was unconstitutional in that it authorized defendants' arrest without a warrant. The prosecution appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed because such a warrantless arrest of defendants was prohibited, and no exigent circumstances were alleged. But the court modified the holding that ch. 901.15 was unconstitutional because the application of ch. 901.15 was problematic, not the statute itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the suppression order because the warrantless arrests of defendants in their residence was unconstitutional, and the prosecution had not alleged exigent circumstances, which could have justified the arrests. However, the court modified the suppression order to the extent that it held a state statute unconstitutional because the statute was only unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, county and its zoning commission, denied a rezoning application of appellant property owners. Appellants sought review of the circuit court's determination that the rezoning question was &quot;fairly debatable&quot; and held that the constitutional issues raised by appellants need not have been decided. In rejecting appellants' argument that the trial judge's decision that the denial of their rezoning request was arbitrary and capricious, the court held that there was no error in the decision that the zoning question was fairly debatable. Further, the court noted that while appellants' request that a repealed ordinance be declared constitutionally invalid would ordinarily have been moot due to the repeal, nevertheless, because the requested ruling would have nullified appellees' denial of appellants' rezoning application and would have entitled them to a de novo hearing under the new ordinance, the constitutional validity of the repealed ordinance was not moot.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the finding that a decision on the constitutional issues was unnecessary and remanded for consideration of the constitutional issues that were raised, holding that because appellant property owners would have still suffered prejudice from their proceedings under the repealed ordinance, the constitutional validity of the ordinance was not moot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, lessee condominiums, sought interlocutory review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which declared, in an action by appellee lessor, that the Condominium Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) (1979), had been applied retroactively in violation of the contracts clauses, U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, lessee condominiums, placed in the registry of the court sums of money accruing for rentals under a 99-year recreational lease, pursuant to the Condominium Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) (1979). Appellee lessor sought a judgment declaring ch. 718.401(4) unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute had been adopted after appellants' the declaration of condominium. The trial court declared that ch. 718.401(4) had been applied retroactively in violation of the contracts clauses, U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Appellants sought review of the judgment. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that appellants' declaration of condominium, which adopted the Condominium Act as amended from time to time, incorporated ch. 718.401(4) by reference, so that no constitutional question of impairment of contract was raised, and finding that the declaration and subsequent statutory amendments bound the interests of both lessee and lessor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court granting a declaratory judgment to appellee lessor that provisions of the Condominium Act had been given unconstitutional retroactive application to appellants, lessee condominiums, because the applicable statutory provisions had been incorporated by reference in appellants' declaration of condominium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County (Florida) granting a motion to dismiss charges against defendants for being accessories after the fact to the escape of a juvenile, arguing that the court erred in finding that escape was not a statutory crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with being accessories after the fact to the escape of a juvenile. The escape occurred while the juvenile was in transit between the doctor's office and the juvenile detention center. The trial court determined that the escape was not a crime because it was not encompassed by the language of the escape statute, thus defendants could not be accessories to a non-existent crime. The trial court dismissed the charges against defendants and the state appealed. The appellate court reversed the order of the trial court after finding that no violence was done to the rule of strict construction of criminal statutes by recognizing that the legislature in enacting Fla. Stat. ch. 39.112 intended to adopt by specific reference all of the ramifications of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.40 (1979), including flight while in transit.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was subject to five years of imprisonment, while the person he aided was found guilty of a felony subject to no more than one year of imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured appealed a decision of the trial court (Florida), which denied his motion in limine seeking to prevent the introduction of collateral source payments by defendant municipality, claiming Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7372 (1977) denied him his right to be redressed for his injuries, violated his right to a fair trial, and violated Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured was involved in a motor vehicle accident with defendant driver after defendant driver ran his automobile through an intersection. Plaintiff sued both defendant driver, and defendant municipality for its failure to maintain, replace, or erect a stop sign at the intersection. Prior to trial, defendant driver was dropped and the trial continued against defendant municipality. Plaintiff appealed the jury verdict awarding him damages, claiming the trial court erred in denying his motion in limine to prevent defendant from introducing evidence of collateral source payments. The court affirmed, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7372 (1977), allowing the introduction of collateral source payments, did not violate Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, because it did not bar plaintiff's cause of action against defendant, but only served to reduce the monies recovered from defendant. The court held that plaintiff was still entitled to full recovery, but due to the collateral source payments, he was not allowed dual recovery. The court held that ch. 627.7372 was not unconstitutional because it discriminated against all persons injured in motor vehicle accidents equally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of plaintiff injured's motion in limine, holding defendant municipality's submission of evidence of collateral source payments did not prevent plaintiff from redress, or from a fair trial, because it only prevented dual recovery. The court held that the introduction of collateral source payments in motor vehicle accidents was not unconstitutional because all similarly injured persons were treated equally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for burglary with a dangerous weapon, possession of burglary tools, carrying a concealed firearm, and possession of a firearm by a felon. Appellant challenged his convictions, claiming that the multiple convictions arising from a single criminal episode violated the single transaction rule and the double jeopardy clause. Affirming the convictions the court held that the crimes were separate and distinct and that none were lesser included offenses. Therefore, separate convictions and sentences were proper. As to the single transaction rule, the court ruled that it had been abrogated by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.021(4) (1976). However, because there was conflicting case law on the issue, the court certified the cause to the state supreme court for determination as to whether the advent of ch. 775.021(4) had done away with the single transaction rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences for multiple offenses because, although the crimes were part of the same criminal episode, they were separate, distinct crimes for which separate convictions and sentences were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a licensed real estate salesman, was adjudicated guilty of possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter, appellee board suspended his license for 60 days based on commission of a crime involving moral turpitude, Fla. Stat. ch. 475.25(1)(e) (1977). Appellant filed a motion with the trial court challenging the constitutionality of the statute, but the motion was denied. On appeal of the suspension, the court held the statute was not vague, and it was constitutional. Nevertheless, the court disagreed with the conclusion that appellant had committed a crime involving moral turpitude. The statute did not show an intent that guilt for every crime was a basis for suspension of a real estate license. In the court's view, mere possession of a controlled substance was not the type of crime contemplated by the moral turpitude language in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellee board's suspension of appellant's real estate license, as his conviction for use of a controlled substance did not represent a crime involving moral turpitude.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee inmates petitioned the trial court for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that they were denied fundamental constitutional rights as the result of inadequate security measures, overcrowded conditions and physical plant deficiencies. The trial court found that habeas corpus was not a viable remedy, but found that probable cause existed for the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus and entered an order directing appellant Department of Corrections to reduce the inmate population. Appellants sought review of the trial court order and questioned whether there was competent substantial evidence to support a finding that appellees constitutional rights were being denied, and whether the trial court erred in granting relief by way of mandamus. The court held that the record supported the finding that an emergency situation existed at Florida State Prison resulting in a denial of appellees' constitutional rights, that the situation necessitated the need for corrective action, and that reduction of the prison population was one viable remedy available to the judge to correct an unconstitutional situation that appellant appeared to be unable or unwilling to redress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of mandamus, finding that appellee inmates had a clear legal right to be confined in an institution where they were free from victimization by other inmates, and that appellant Department of Corrections had an equally clear legal duty to provide appellees with such incarceration.</SPAN></P>

The burglary tools appellant possessed were a screwdriver, gloves, and a flashlight. The trial court imposed separate sentences for each offense.

Appellee answered two of the questions favorably to appellant, but refused to answer the third question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city, which had a pension ordinance that appellant had previously changes without negotiating with labor organizations, petitioned appellee commission for a declaratory statement concerning its authority to make further changes without bargaining with bargaining agents for appellant's employees. Appellee responded on the merits of two of the three questions, and its responses essentially declared that Fla. Stat. ch. 447.301(2) (1979) and Fla. Stat. ch. 447.309(5) (1979) removed employees' right to negotiate on retirement to the extent that the subject was controlled by a local ordinance, and that the employer was under no duty to bargain over a change in the ordinance. The court found it unnecessary to consider the merits of the questions, and reversed because each of the questions called for an interpretation of the statutory provisions that abridged the right of employees to bargain collectively in violation of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court also held that the unconstitutional provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 447.301(2) (1979) and Fla. Stat. ch. 447.309(5) (1979) were severable, leaving the remainder standing.</SPAN></P>

Appellant son alleged that he was the illegitimate son of deceased. Appellee filed a petition to determine beneficiaries. The lower court determined that appellant was barred from asserting a claim as a lineal descendant of his alleged father because he had been adopted. The court also found that the statute providing this bar, Fla. Stat. ch. 732.108, was constitutional. On appeal, the court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 732.108 was a complete bar to appellant's claim. The court rejected appellant's argument that the statute violated his equal protection rights under the state and federal constitutions. The court noted that the argument was best made before the legislature. The court further noted that since the statute provided that appellant was a lineal descendant of his adopting parents, he was afforded full and equal protection to inherit from his adoptive parents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, school board and its insurer, and cross-appellants, driver and her insurer, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), awarding wrongful death and survivorship damages pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.02 (1971) and Fla. Stat. ch. 46.021 (1971), respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees' daughter, while waiting for a school bus, was struck by an automobile driven by cross-appellant. In a suit for damages for the wrongful death of their daughter pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.02 (1971) and for survivorship damages pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 46.021 (1971), a jury returned a verdict against appellants, school board and its insurer, and cross-appellants, driver and her insurer. The appellate court held that trial court had discretion on granting severance of appellant insurer under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.270(b). Because there was no abuse of discretion, and the policy provided coverage for alleged injuries under appellant school board's waiver of immunity pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 455.06 (1971), the trial court's decision was not disturbed. Expert testimony was admissible because the expert's knowledge was beyond the common layperson's understanding and assisted the jury in arriving at the truth. Therefore, judgment was affirmed as to appellants. Because appellees filed their amended complaint for their survival action after Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4) (1971) statute of limitations had expired, the denial of cross-appellants' motion to dismiss was reversed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant asserted that there was insufficient evidence to revoke his license and that ch. 626.611 and 626.621 were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment. According to the court, there was substantial evidence in the record which established that appellant failed to act appropriately with his clients' funds and failed to procure insurance when he was required to. Next, the court held that ch. 626.611 and 626.621 were not unconstitutional for failure to provide any standard or guideline as to which acts or omissions would constitute grounds for revocation. The court held that the legislature could enact laws that left some discretion in the operation and enforcement of the law with the administrative official. Finally, the court held that sections 626.611 and 626.621 fell within the exception to strict requirements of express guidelines because the statutes fell within the line of cases that were designed to aid the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile criminal case was transferred from the juvenile division of the circuit court to the criminal division to try appellant as an adult.

The court affirmed appellant's convictions for robbery and aggravated assault without prejudice.

Then the court determined that a juvenile charged with a life offense under an indictment pursuant to &sect; 39.02(5)(c), was not the exclusive route to the criminal division of the circuit court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought an interlocutory appeal from the decision of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), contending that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.4132 prohibited various other insurance coverages from being added to or &quot;stacked&quot; upon the $ 15,000 that appellee motorist was entitled to receive from appellant as coverage on the vehicle involved in a collision that appellee operated with permission from the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged the ruling of the trial court that appellee motorist was entitled to add or &quot;stack&quot; coverages on the vehicle that she was operating with the owner's permission, on a second vehicle covered under the owner's policy but not involved in the collision, on the other vehicle involved in the collision, and under appellee's own policy coverage. Appellant agreed that appellee was entitled to the coverage on the vehicle she was operating, but argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.4132 prohibited the coverages from the owner's second vehicle and coverage under appellee's own policy from being added to appellant's coverage. The court stated that the trial court erred in directing that coverage on the owner's second vehicle be stacked because appellee was not a named insured, did not reside in the policy owner's household, and did not occupy the vehicle at the time of the accident. The court held that the trial court properly stacked the coverage under appellee's own policy to appellant's coverage because the anti-stacking statute did not reduce the coverage available by reason of insurance policies insuring different named insureds.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, appellant contended that the statute was so vague that it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an agency. The court found the hearing officer's definition of &quot;fireworks&quot; to be in accord with legislative intent and appellant failed to show that the agency action in adopting the hearing officer's recommendation was error. Therefore, the final order adopting the hearing officer's recommended penalty was affirmed. The court also noted that words of common usage in a statute should be construed in their ordinary meaning.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the designating of a specific time period for the filing of a delinquency petition after intake was substantive, not procedural; therefore, the statute controlled. The trial court erred in following the 30 day provision of the procedural rule. The orders of dismissal were reversed and the cases remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for trafficking in more than 400 grams of cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b) (1979). He was sentenced to five years probation and six months incarceration. Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it compelled him to give up his right against self incrimination under the U. S. Const. amend. V. The statute contained a provision whereby the prosecution could request a substantial reduction of the 15 year sentence for trafficking if defendant offered assistance to the prosecution. The court in affirming the convictions, and upholding the constitutionality of the statute, held that although defendant had in fact given the prosecution substantial assistance in hopes of obtaining a lighter sentence under the statute, the assistance was not compelled under the statute. The court also held that no Fifth Amendment violation had occurred because the inducement contained in the statute was only given as an alternative to a more unpleasant sentence by the trial court, therefore it was not regarded as an undue burden on the privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that the statute had not unconstitutionally compromised defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment because nothing had compelled defendant to do anything.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pregnant employees were required to take mandatory maternity leave from their employment as stewardesses, under a collective bargaining agreement, as soon as they were aware of their pregnancies. Appellants' claim for unemployment compensation benefits during maternity leave was denied by appellee Florida Unemployment Appeals Commission, which held that sick pay benefits paid to appellants were wages under Fla. Stat. ch. 443.03(13)(a) (1977), and thus appellants were ineligible for benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 443.03(12)(a) and Fla. Stat. ch. 443.04(3)(a) because they were not unemployed. Although the court affirmed appellee's decision that disability insurance payments were not wages, it reversed appellee's decision denying benefits, because sick pay was expressly excluded from classification as wages under Fla. Stat. ch. 443.03(13)(b)(2) and therefore was not wages under Fla. Stat. ch. 443.03. The court thus remanded for further proceedings to determine the benefits due to appellants, because they were in fact unemployed under ch. 443.04(3)(a) and were not rendered unavailable for work simply because of their pregnancies.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 403.804(1) that makes the commission the adjudicatory body for final actions taken by appellee was unconstitutional. The court denied the request for rehearing because appellants' constitutional challenge was without merit. It had previously been ruled that there would be judicial review of final agency action after review of the action by the commission. Further, while ch. 403.804(1) was amended in 1980 to repeal the adjudicatory function of the commission, the amendment specifically provided that it did not affect any appeals pending before the commission.</SPAN></P>

In the underlying action, appellant sought to cancel and declare void a 99-year recreation lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessee and appellee lessor entered into a 99-year recreation lease, which appellant sought to declare void in the underlying action. Appellant moved, under Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) (1979), for an order to deposit into the registry of the court franchise fees and rents under the lease. The parties stipulated that rather than deposit rent into the registry of the court, appellant would pay appellee enough money to meet its mortgage obligations and would deposit the franchise fees into a savings account. Subsequently, the Florida Supreme Court held that application of ch. 718.401(4) to contracts in existence prior to the effective date of the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court vacated the previous orders, ordered appellant to continue paying appellee the mortgage sum, but relieved it from stipulations regarding the franchise fee. On appeal, the court reversed the required payment for appellee's mortgage and affirmed as to the franchise fee, finding that, absent ch. 718.401(4), the court had no authority to require appellant to pay rent. The court noted that, as appellee would have a remedy at law, the court could not exercise its equity powers.</SPAN></P>

She believed that she was entitled to a 24-hour notice under her union contract and declined to go to work on Friday. The claims representative found that appellee had declined to come to work on Friday due to non-compelling personal reasons and, therefore, was ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits for the week that included that Friday. On appeal, the referee found that appellee had been unavailable for work for only one day and that no penalty would be imposed if only one day of availability was involved. The Board of Review affirmed the referee, and appellant employer challenged the decision. The reviewing court held that there was no legal basis for the appeals referee's rationale. Fla. Stat. ch. 443.06(2), provided that an individual shall be disqualified for benefits if the individual failed without good cause to accept suitable work when offered to him.

The lower court denied appellant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The court affirmed, concluding that although appellant was reasonably diligent in moving to set aside the judgment and that he demonstrated excusable neglect for failing to timely plead or otherwise appear in the action, he did not have a meritorious defense to justify setting aside the default. Appellant claimed as a defense that the action was barred by the four-year statute of limitations for paternity actions under Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants entered pleas of nolo contendere to charges of drug possession, specifically reserving the right to appeal the denial of their motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutionally broad search warrant. The command of the search warrant stated only generally that the personal property to be seized was &quot;a controlled substance,&quot; though the affidavit of probable cause had specifically identified methaqualone. On appeal, the court reversed defendants' convictions, concluding that the language in the command of the search warrant was unconstitutionally broad, because it identified the property to be seized as &quot;a controlled substance&quot; without further description, when the supporting affidavit specifically mentioned methaqualone. The court found that the search warrant, as stated, allowed officers to conduct an improper exploratory search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged an order of the lower court (Florida) that suppressed evidence of defendant's narcotics trafficking obtained in preflight screening procedures at an airport.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted his luggage for X-ray inspection at an airport. The X-ray operator informed defendant that his bags would need to be manually inspected. Defendant refused and, over his objection, was removed from the inspection line by a police officer. His luggage was opened and cocaine was discovered. The trial court suppressed the evidence of narcotics trafficking obtained at the preflight screen procedures. The court addressed the issue, not previously addressed by the state courts, of whether the preflight search process itself was constitutionally permissible. The court noted that other courts had uniformly found preflight screening systems constitutional on grounds analogous to a border search, under a Terry stop analysis, through consent, and by administrative search. The court affirmed the lower court's suppression of evidence, rejecting each of those points in turn. Unless the manual search of defendant's luggage was made with at least a founded suspicion of criminal activity and the presence of weapons, it was invalid. Unidentified bulky objects in his luggage, without more, could not justify a Terry stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment in suppressing the evidence against the state because the warrantless search of defendant's luggage was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This action was instituted following an automobile accident, where appellee driver rear-ended appellant driver in his work van owned by appellee company. Appellant contended that the trial court committed error by its failure to enter a directed verdict on the issue of liability. The court found that that the facts of this case raised a presumption that appellee was negligent. Since appellant's vehicle was lawfully occupying the roadway when it was struck from the rear, a rebuttable presumption that appellee was negligent was created. Since the presumption was unrebutted, the trial court should have directed a verdict on the issue of liability. Because the verdict form was ambiguous, the court was unable to determine whether the jury decided that appellant failed to incur damages or whether the jury concluded that appellee was not negligent. The court ordered a new trial on damages only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died while residing in Florida. Petitioner, the personal representative, paid federal estate taxes in excess of the federal credit for estate taxes paid the several states, which credit amounted to $ 12,349.44. Petitioner paid Indiana estate taxes of $ 11,578.83 pursuant to an assessment by Indiana. Petitioner paid Florida estate tax of $ 12,349.44. Petitioner contended that the amount of Indiana death taxes actually paid must be subtracted from the credit allowable for purposes of Fla. Stat. ch. 198.02 and that he was entitled to a refund of $ 11,690.11. The court reversed and remanded the comptroller's decision to deny the refund. The taxes owed to Indiana were required to be paid according to Ind. Code &sect; 6-4.1-11-2(b) and therefore could serve to reduce Florida taxes under Fla. Stat. ch. 198.02. The securities that made up the bulk of the decedent's estate were part of the decedent's Indiana gross estate because the trustee, domiciled in Indiana, had legal title to the securities. The comptroller's position that Indiana should have given credit for the Florida tax was without merit because under Indiana law the Florida tax did not qualify for credit in Indiana.</SPAN></P>

A hearing officer of appellee division sustained r. 7A-4.13 and denied appellant's challenge. As a result, appellant sought review. On review, the court affirmed the hearing officer because the evidence submitted by appellant did not demonstrate that r. 7A-4.13 was without a rational relationship to ch. 561.42.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juveniles escaped from a facility and were charged with escape from a training school, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 39.112 (1979). Appellants motion to dismiss the charges was denied. Appellants all pled nolo contendere and sought review of the denial. The court affirmed, holding that the facility which housed appellants was a training school because it had all the attributes of other statutorily designated training schools, although it was not expressly designated as such by Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 10H-1.03(7). The court also held that ch. 39.112 acted to expand the class of persons that were chargeable with the crime of escape, under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court enjoined appellant Department of Revenue from collecting admissions taxes on admission fees collected from customers of appellees, the owners of a party deep-sea fishing boat. The trial court based its judgment on appellant's representation that it would not hold appellees accountable for uncollected admissions taxes accruing from August 1, 1970, to February 6, 1972, and on an exceptional set of circumstances justifying application of the defense of estoppel. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that appellees established their reliance on prior case law, which put into controversy appellant's authority to collect admission taxes, and properly pled the estoppel defense. The court stated that, although a decision of a court of last resort overruling a former decision was generally retrospective as well as prospective, property or contract rights that were acquired under former construction should not be destroyed by the retrospective application of a later overruling. The court stated that the diverse interpretations and futility of efforts by trial judges to apply the case law in a rational manner supported the finding of exceptional circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault with a shotgun and was sentenced to a minimum mandatory sentence of three years' imprisonment followed by two years' probation. Appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, claiming that his threat to a police officer was conditional and therefore precluded the establishment of an aggravated assault, and that he did not know that the individuals he threatened were police officers. Appellant also asserted the application of the minimum mandatory sentence provision, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(2) (1977), unlawfully enhanced his punishment and was unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that appellant's conditional threat did not preclude a finding that the police officer was placed in fear of imminent harm, and that his conviction was not contrary to the law and was sufficiently supported by the evidence. There was also evidence to support the finding that appellant was aware of the police officers' identity. As to ch. 775.087(2), the court held that appellant had failed to preserve the issue on appeal and that, regardless, the constitutionality of ch. 775.087(2) had been previously upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for aggravated assault with a shotgun, because the fact that appellant's threat to harm a police officer was conditional did not preclude a finding that the officer was placed fear of imminent harm, and the evidence supported the finding that appellant was aware that the persons he threatened were police officers.</SPAN></P>

The ticket provided that a record had been made of the violation, and that in the event of recurrence, a bond would be required. The court first ruled that a municipal ordinance with quasicriminal sanctions might be the subject of an action for declaratory relief. In affirming the trial judge, the court determined that appellant had no standing because he did not have an actual, present, and adverse interest in the subject as required by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 86.021. While it could be said that the warning placed appellant in jeopardy, he was not in jeopardy unless he violated the ordinance.

The court reasoned that the rule was no more than an internal guideline established by appellee workers' compensation ratings bureau, which was a private agency not subject to the state's administrative procedure law. Reviewing the record, the court then held that the rule was reasonably applied to deny appellants' claim for a more favorable insurance premium calculation because appellants had not gone through a material change in ownership, requisite to garnering a more favorable insurance premium calculation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. chs. 409.325(1)(b), 409.325(5)(b) (1979), into the pretrial intervention program created under Fla. Stat. ch. 944.025 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, who was charged with third degree felony welfare fraud under Fla. Stat. chs. 409.325(1)(b), 409.325(5)(b) (1979), applied to the pretrial intervention program created under Fla. Stat. ch. 944.025 (1979). Her application was refused by the state attorney pursuant to an existing published statement that denied consideration for the program due to the serious and widespread nature of the welfare fraud and the impact the offense had on the general taxpayer and public at large. The trial court found the state attorney's reasons for denying the application to be arbitrary, capricious, and without legal reason or justification, and found that the trial court acted outside of its appropriate jurisdiction. In quashing and remanding the trial court's order, the court stated that the determinative issue was whether diversion into the pretrial intervention program was a prosecutorial or a judicial decision, concluded that the legislature vested the prosecutor with discretion regarding whether or not to prosecute a defendant who might be eligible for the pretrial intervention program, and that the prosecutorial decision could not be reviewed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's petition for certiorari, and quashed and remanded the trial court's order. The decision regarding whether or not to prosecute defendant for felony welfare fraud, who might be eligible for the pretrial intervention program, was within the discretion of the state attorney and could not be reviewed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought recovery of insurance benefits. Trial court held defendant could set off personal injury protection (PIP) and medical benefits against uninsured motorist insurance benefits that it paid to plaintiff. However, court also held defendant had to pay full amount of uninsured motorist coverage because it did not give plaintiff chance to reject full-uninsured motorist coverage when he replaced car on his policy. Defendant appealed. Appeals court reversed because Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727(1) did not allow setoff for PIP and medical benefits because legislature enacted statute to clearly state such a setoff was not allowed, and fair interpretation of policy disallowed setoff because plaintiff paid for all three coverages. Moreover, it held that defendant had to pay uninsured motorist claim amount that exceeded amount reflected in plaintiff's original policy because plaintiff did not pay an additional premium for full uninsured motorist coverage. There was no support for contention that defendant had to conduct full rejection routine regarding full uninsured motorist coverage that was required when policy was first written when plaintiff replaced vehicle on policy.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 812.021(2)(b) (1975), for his theft of funds from the sheriff's department. Appellant assigned as error the admission of business records under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no error in the admission of evidence, but finding that the indictment did not allege grand larceny in the second-degree, the court affirmed the conviction in part, reversed it in part, and remanded for resentencing. Appellant was convicted of stealing money from the sheriff's department's investigative fund. The court held that records of the fund were properly admitted pursuant to the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 92.36(2) (1975). The court held that it was not necessary for the persons who made the entries in the records to testify, but that all that was required was for someone to properly authenticate the records. The court next held that the indictment did not allege that appellant was a public servant who stole public monies, and thus did not make out a second-degree felony under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.021(2)(b) (1975). It did not matter that the evidence established this degree of the crime; a defendant could not be convicted of a greater crime, or greater degree of crime, than that charged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant for grand larceny in the second-degree, the indictment had alleged only the third-degree of the offense, and appellant could not be convicted of a greater crime than that charged.</SPAN></P>

A supervisor within the vital statistics unit of appellee Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services advised appellants by letter that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two offenses of sexual battery committed on separate girls 11 years of age or younger in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1975). The jury recommended life imprisonment for each offense. The trial court imposed death. Defendant appealed, and the case was remanded. On remand, defendant's attorney asked for a continuance on the basis that he had just met defendant at the sentencing proceeding. The trial court denied the continuance and imposed two consecutive life sentences. Defendant appealed and the court remanded for resentencing. The court held that a defendant was entitled to be represented by counsel at the time of sentencing, and this right included the right to confer with counsel. The court found that because a conference may have given rise to arguments on sentencing to be presented to the trial court, defendant should have been given the opportunity to confer with counsel prior to sentencing. The court stated that nothing in its opinion prevented the trial court from re-imposing the same sentences on defendant that had been appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of various crimes. None of the appellants were married, but each had several children. Appellants claimed that they committed crimes based on the need to care for their children. The trial court placed all the appellants on probation, with several special conditions, including a condition prohibiting sexual intercourse with anyone other than a lawfully married spouse. Appellants argued that they had a fundamental right of privacy entailing freedom of choice to engage in sexual intercourse and that such right could only be limited by a compelling state interest. On review, the court agreed that the condition failed to meet the reasonable relation test. The condition bore only a tangential relationship to the underlying crimes, related to noncriminal conduct, required marriage and forbid extramarital sex. Therefore, the probation condition was invalid. The condition at issue was stricken, and the orders were otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff seller appealed from the final judgment of the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which found that equipment sold and delivered to Kentucky was not subject to Florida's sales tax, while equipment sold and delivered to Venezuela was subject to Florida's sales tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff seller challenged the decision that found the sale of equipment for use in Kentucky was sales-tax exempt, but the sale of equipment for use in Venezuela was not. Plaintiff sold heavy equipment to defendant purchaser for use in Kentucky. The equipment was loaded at plaintiff's place of business directly upon a common carrier for immediate transporting to Kentucky. Defendant represented he was exempt from sales tax in Kentucky, and plaintiff did not charge and collect the Florida sales tax. Defendant later purchased equipment from plaintiff for use in Venezuela. Again the sale was FOB Miami; however, defendant resold the equipment to an independent licensed exporter for shipment to Venezuela. Because of the planned export, plaintiff collected no sales tax on this purchase. The court affirmed, holding that the Kentucky machinery was delivered to a common carrier for shipment out of Florida and that transaction was not taxable. As to the Venezuelan sale, the evidence was insufficient to prove that plaintiff delivered the equipment to a licensed exporter for exporting, and the court found that transaction to be taxable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, adopting the trial court's analysis. The evidence did not establish that the Venezuela bound machinery was delivered to a licensed exporter for exporting, but did establish that the Kentucky machinery was delivered to a common carrier for shipment out of the State. Therefore, while the Kentucky transaction was not taxable, the Venezuela sale was.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 112.313(6), and sought a supersedeas order to stay the governor's action, that was granted by the court pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 112.3241 (1979). The court vacated the stay and dismissed the appeal and found that the section of the statute that permitted the court to issue a supersedeas order was unconstitutional. The court held that the governor's power to suspend a public official was independent of, and could not be impinged upon, by statute. The court found that the Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7(a) conferred the power of removal on the governor. The court found that the declaration that a portion of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner real estate commission brought a revocation of license action against respondents, realtors and salesmen, for violating Fla. Stat. ch. 475.42(l)(j) (1977) by filing a notice of lis pendens on real estate to recover a real estate commission. The hearing officer concluded that although respondents filed a lis pendens, ch. 475.42(l)(j) was unconstitutional as it applied to the respondents because it had a chilling effect on the rights of respondents to seek redress in the courts. Petitioner rejected the hearing officer's conclusions of law, held the statute constitutional, and suspended respondents' licenses for 30 days. Respondents appealed that decision. The court affirmed, holding that the classification of realtors and salesmen as a class of persons who were prevented from using a lis pendens to collect a real estate commission was not unreasonable because they are privileged by statutes to collect commission. The court held that because realtors and salesmen occupied a position of confidence toward the public, ch. 475.42(l)(j) was necessary to prevent the misuse of a special tool, a lis pendens, by respondents to disadvantage the public.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because appellant had placed the constitutionality of appellee's contrary interpretation of the act at issue, it had pleaded a justiciable controversy. The court held that only the circuit court had jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of the act, so that administrative exhaustion was not a prerequisite to this action. The court also held that appellee city was properly joined as a party pursuant to Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order from the Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering (Florida), which revoked appellant's horse training license and imposed a $ 400 fine against her for violations of Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-4.25(12)(a), and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-405.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with violating Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-4.25(12)(a), and Fla. Admin. Code Ann, r. 7E-405 (the rules), by allowing a horse under her care to race with the drug Butorphanol in its system. After a hearing, an order was entered which revoked appellant's license for two years. Appellant sought the court's review, asserting, among other things, that the rules were unconstitutional because the term &quot;narcotic&quot; was not defined, that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Butorphanol was a narcotic, and that the two-year license revocation exceeded what could properly be imposed under Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-4.09(3). The court held that the term &quot;narcotic&quot; sufficiently designated prohibited substances to a trainer who had expertise not common to the ordinary person. Further, medical testimony at the hearing revealed Butorphanol could produce the narcotic effects of morphine. However, appellant was correct that Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-4.09(3) was violated by imposition of a two-year license revocation where such could only be revoked for a maximum of 180 days. Order was affirmed, but modified as to the revocation of appellant's license and fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for allowing a horse under her care to race with a narcotic in its system was affirmed where the code sections under which appellant was charged sufficiently established a standard of permissible conduct and where the evidence at appellant's hearing was sufficient to establish that the drug at issue was a narcotic, but reversed as to the penalty imposed where such exceeded the maximum penalty authorized under the code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was imprisoned in Tennessee when the information charging him with armed robbery was filed in Florida. The state and the trial court received appellant's request for disposition of the charges against him on July 5, 1978. At the January 9, 1979 hearing, appellant brought a motion to dismiss pursuant to the interstate agreement on detainers, Fla. Stat. ch. 941.45 (1979). The trial court denied the motion, and appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere after reserving the right to appeal. On review, the court reversed holding that ch. 941.45 was violated since appellant was not brought to trial within 180 days after the state and the trial court received appellant's request for disposition of the charges. The court concluded that the state's contention that ch. 941.45 was unconstitutional since it conflicted with Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191 was not a justiciable issue. The court found that appellant's rights were violated even under Rule 3.191, which established a six month time limit for appellant to be brought to trial after receipt of his request for disposition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court determined that appellee landowner had sufficiently not demonstrated that the damage to his property amounted to a taking of it, for which the whole was to be condemned and paid for by appellant Florida Department of Transportation. The court noted that although appellant's reversal of the drainage flow had imposed a substantial burden on the property, there was no evidence that the property had been permanently deprived of the existing beneficial use to which it was put at the time of the acts constituting the taking. The court then held that appellee, as the subsequent purchaser and grantee, had no claim in inverse condemnation without assignment of his predecessors' claim, which had not been shown, because appellant's construction of the water drainage system had occurred prior to appellee's acquisition of the subject property. The court concluded by excising the ruling that appellee's property had been taken and had to be purchased in eminent domain; however, the modified order was affirmed, in order to enjoin appellant's continued burdening of appellee's land by the use of a water drainage system that reversed the natural and previous flow.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court excised a portion of the injunctive order relating to a finding of condemnation where appellee landowner did not show that his property was permanently burdened by the water drainage system, the court affirmed the modified order enjoining appellant Florida Department of Transportation from continuing its tortious use of the drainage system to reverse the water flow in a manner that created a nuisance to appellee's property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed upon the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiffs being limited to their right of appeal of the final agency action of the Public Employees Relations Commission to a district court of appeal. The appellate court reversed and remanded, with directions to the trial court to require defendant to file an answer, and then for the trial court to take such further proceedings as it deemed appropriate. The matter was not ripe for a determination that the commission proceedings were in fact res adjudicata and prevented the instant independent action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the order of the trial court (Florida), which suppressed tape recordings of conversations between appellees and an informant working as an agent of the county sheriff's department, in connection with controlled purchases of illegal drugs from appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state contended that the tape recordings of conversations violated neither Fla. Const. art I, &sect; 12 nor the U.S. Const. amend IV, and that no intercept warrant was required because the informant gave prior consent for the recording and the purpose of the interception was to obtain evidence of a criminal act. The informant had voluntarily consented to wear a concealed microphone and transmitter, by means of which each of the drug transactions was tape recorded by officers outside the home. Appellees allegedly were present and participated in both sales. It was conceded that no intercept warrant was obtained, and no contention was made by appellant that the officers had insufficient time to obtain a warrant. The court reversed the suppression and held that here it would have been untenable to consider the activities and reports of the police agent himself, though acting without a warrant, to be a &quot;reasonable&quot; investigative effort and lawful under the Fourth Amendment but to view the same agent with a recorder or transmitter as conducting an &quot;unreasonable&quot; and unconstitutional search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the suppression order and remanded the case for further proceedings because the conduct and revelations of an agent operating with electronic equipment did not invade appellees' constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium association contested defendant developer's entitlement to certain monies. Initially, the parties agreed to place the contested funds in an interest-bearing account pending the outcome of the litigation. Subsequently, however, plaintiff sought a temporary mandatory injunction to require the transfer of all funds on account and all future monies to plaintiff. The trial court granted the injunction without bond, and defendant appealed. After reviewing the basic principles governing mandatory injunctions, the court held that it was reversible error to issue the injunction without bond because plaintiff did not request an injunction without bond in its complaint. Furthermore, there was neither proof nor a judicial finding that plaintiff was unable to give a bond. Accordingly, the order granting the injunction was reversed and the cause was remanded with directions to the trial court to vacate said order and conduct further proceedings consistent the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for carrying a concealed firearm. The lower court denied his motion to suppress the firearm and appellant pled nolo contendere. On appeal, the court considered whether an inventory search of luggage was precluded. Appellant was taken into lawful custody under circumstances which, the court found, did not suggest a pretextual arrest. His bag accompanied him to the jail, and appellant never requested that it be taken elsewhere, or be given to anyone else. The court held that appellant's bag should have been inventoried and stored as a unit rather than opened and itemized. The court further held, however, that the search was reasonable under the circumstances. A valid weapon search of appellant's luggage, pursuant to routine procedure and incident to the safe storage of weapons, negated a finding that there was an exploratory search or any other search not motivated by the desire to reasonably execute a legitimate governmental purpose. Therefore, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that the search was valid.</SPAN></P>

Respondent trial court denied the stay and ruled that it would consider the constitutional issue only after the administrative hearing, and if the court would not decide the constitutionality issue.

He was convicted of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 104.061(2) (1977), which makes it a felony to promise anything of value to an individual in order to buy his or her vote. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not void for vagueness. The term &quot;anything of value&quot; was clear and self-defining and was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it was confined to non-protected, criminal conduct. The evidence was sufficient to show a violation, despite defendant's lack of knowledge of the law, given the existence of intent to give something of value for votes. Transmission of the letter completed the crime, such that the identity of a recipient as a registered voter was inconsequential.</SPAN></P>

Alternatively, the state argued that if the Act was retroactive, its application was discretionary. After further considering the record, briefs, and reargument of counsel, the court granted the state's motion for rehearing and withdrew its opinion issued on January 23, 1980. The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the cause remanded with directions to resentence defendant. The court reasoned that since the Act altered the prescribed punishments for those persons meeting its requirements, it could not apply to offenses committed prior to its effective date.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court appointed respondents, two private attorneys, to represent an indigent criminal defendant. After trial, respondents filed motions for counsel fees. After the trial court entered an order awarding equal fees to both respondents, to be paid by petitioner county, petitioner appealed. The court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 27.53(3) (1979) allowed the appointment and payment of only one attorney to represent an indigent defendant. The court ruled that only the first attorney appointed, who served as lead counsel, could be compensated by the trial court. The court held that, although the trial court clearly had the inherent authority to appoint the second attorney as co-counsel, it had neither the statutory authority nor the inherent authority to compensate the second attorney. The court quashed the order awarding attorney fees to respondent co-counsel and held that the fee awarded to respondent lead counsel exceeded the statutory maximum. The court remanded the case to the trial court to take additional evidence, if necessary, and enter an order awarding a fee to respondent lead counsel in accordance with Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a patient and his wife, filed a complaint against appellee hospital in an effort to recover for personal injuries sustained by appellant patient while in the care of appellee. The trial court dismissed appellants' complaint with prejudice because appellant failed to comply with the Florida Medical Liability Mediation Act. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the legislative intent was to submit to Medical Liability Mediation only claims arising out of those acts or conduct which are peculiarly malpractice when committed by a medical or osteopath physician, podiatrist, hospital, or health maintenance organization. The court explained that appellants' complaint was based on negligence of appellee's janitorial staff, not medical malpractice. Accordingly, appellants' claim was not appropriate for submission to Medical Liability Mediation. Moreover, the Florida Medical Liability Mediation Act had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of a second-degree felony and placed on probation for fifteen years. His probation was revoked due to various probation violations and he was sentenced to ten years prison. Appellant was seventeen years old when the crime was committed and he was nineteen years old when his probation was revoked. He contended that the sentence was contrary to the Florida Youthful Offender Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 958.011 et seq. The court affirmed the sentence but remanded the case to correct the record and eliminate one condition of probation as a violation. The Youthful Offender Act was not in effect at the time of the offense and did not apply retroactively. Further, it was not a procedural statute, which would have given it immediate effect. The statute that was in effect at the time the offense was committed controlled the maximum penalty at sentencing. In this case, it was fifteen years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents of appellant children obtained a divorce. The divorce decree incorporated an agreement that father would pay to mother sums of money for the support and education of appellants, and to provide for appellants' security in father's will if he ever remarried. Father later married appellee wife. When mother died, father cancelled an existing prenuptial agreement and remade his will to the exclusion of appellants. After father died, appellants sought a declaratory action to determine their rights under the divorce decree and the will made by father prior to his remarriage. The trial court found that all obligations of father under the divorce decree had been satisfied prior to his death, and entered an award for attorney fees against appellants. When appellants failed to make the first installment, the trial court issued a contempt order and ordered their imprisonment. The court reversed and held that the money judgment was subject to the category of debts for which no person was to be imprisoned under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;11. Such provision precluded the trial court's use of its contempt power and sentence of imprisonment for enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the contempt order issued by the trial court against appellant children for nonpayment of an attorney fee award because such money judgment was the type of debt for which no person was to be imprisoned under the Florida Constitution. Thus, the trial court was precluded from using its contempt power to enforce payment.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, it awarded appellee a peremptory writ of mandamus to coerce appellant's approval of the petition as to form. Appellant challenged the circuit court's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant's assertion that Dade County, Fla., Home Rule Charter &sect; 7.01(6)(a) contravened the general statutes as to the manner and means of levying ad valorem taxes did not elevate the argument to one of constitutional dimension. Absent a challenge upon constitutional grounds, the court refused to interfere in the election process concerning a proposal that was valid on its face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a mentally retarded individual, challenged his involuntary commitment to the department of health and rehabilitative services for treatment at a residential retardation facility pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 393.11 (1977) of the Retardation Prevention and Community Services Act. Ch. 393.11 provided for the involuntary commitment of mentally retarded individuals who were in need of treatment and rehabilitation. For the first time on appeal, appellant contended that ch. 393.11was unconstitutional on its face. The appellate court reversed the trial court's commitment order. The appellate court held that appellant's alleged error was fundamental and could be reviewed on appeal. The appellate court further held that civil commitment under ch. 393.11 was unconstitutional because the statute deprived an individual of his fundamental right to liberty without comporting with substantive due process. The appellate court concluded that ch. 393.11 lacked any criteria limiting its application to those individuals who lacked the capacity to weigh for themselves the risks of freedom and the benefits of hospitalization or to those who were a danger to themselves or others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's order of commitment because the specific statutory section of the Retardation Prevention and Community Services Act, under which appellant, a mentally retarded individual, was committed, was unconstitutional.

Based upon the aforementioned ordinance, appellee ordered appellant houseboat dwellers to remove their houseboats from appellee's shoreline. Appellants brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief that challenged the provisions of the subject ordinance. The trial court determined that the ordinance was valid and appellants sought review. The court reversed the judgment and quashed that portion of the ordinance that permitted the watercraft only in certain areas of appellee, finding that provision had no discernible relationship to the health, welfare, or safety of the general populace and was, therefore, invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bystander challenged his conviction from the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) for possession of marijuana based upon a denial of a motion to suppress evidence seized from appellant in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 901.151 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bystander was present in a mobile home when undercover police purchased marijuana from appellant's companion. A search of appellant resulted in the seizure of marijuana. Appellant was convicted of possession after the trial court denied his motion to suppress. The appellate court reversed his conviction. Appellant's companion was armed, so there was ample basis for a limited search of appellant for weapons under Fla. Stat. ch. 901.151 (1979). However, even though ch. 901.151 stated if a search disclosed a weapon or any evidence of a criminal offense it could be seized, the police were prohibited from searching and seizing contraband after discerning no apprehension that appellant was armed. In order to adhere to the principles announced in Terry regarding stop and frisks as an exception to U.S. Const. amend. IV, ch. 901.151 had to be strictly limited to authorizing a seizure of contraband or other evidence of a crime during a legal stop and frisk, provided that police believed an object acquired from a suspect was a weapon. Also, the search of appellant was not permitted merely because appellant happened to be within the area of immediate control of the person arrested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant bystander's conviction for marijuana possession because the denial of appellant's motion to suppress was improper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer sought review of an order by an interlocutory appeal from the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida), which allowed appellee condominium association to deposit rents relating to a condominium recreation lease into the court registry pending the outcome of litigation between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer contended that the deposit order was entered pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) (1977), which was an impairment of his constitutional contract rights. Appellant's argument was based on a particular order, which specifically recited reliance upon the statute. Appellee condominium association contended that the order was not entered pursuant to the statute but was instead based upon Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.600, which provided for court-authorized deposits as a discretionary matter. Appellee asserted that the motion for permission to deposit was amended to delete reference to the statute and that the trial court did not base the order on the statute. The court found that the order authorized the deposit of rent monies specifically pursuant to ch. 718.401(4). It was assumed that withdrawal of the deposits, if requested, would be pursuant to the same statute rather than in accordance with Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.600. For this reason, the court reversed the order, holding that ch. 718.401(4) did not allow disbursements to appellant for personal needs, which was an impairment of his contract rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the order authorized the deposit of rent monies specifically pursuant to the statute, which unconstitutionally impaired ability to obtain disbursement of the funds.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 440.15(10)(a) to require exclusion of cost of living increases from federal social security benefits in computing the 80 percent wage limitation. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that ch. 440.15(10)(a) was not void for vagueness, finding that the construction accorded a logical effect to the language of the amendment. The court further found that 80 percent ceiling on compensation benefits was constitutional. Moreover, the court agreed with the trial court that the five percent supplemental benefit had been declared and held to be limited by the 80 percent maximum. The court further held the fact that the five percent supplemental benefit had been declared and held to be limited by the 80 percent maximum was not dispositive of the Social Security cost of living increase because one was a state benefit specifically described and limited by the Workmen's Compensation Law while the other was a federal benefit which the Workmen's Compensation Law specifically stated shall be governed and controlled by federal, as opposed to state, law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner who had a previous felony conviction was convicted again for aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in August 1979. Petitioner was allowed to post bond pending pre-sentencing investigation, but upon the prosecution's motion, his bail was revoked. Petitioner filed an appeal of his conviction and a motion to set bail, which the trial court denied under Fla. Stat. ch. 903.132(1979) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.961(a). Petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the statute and the rule should not have been applied to him because they were not in effect in 1961, the date of his earlier conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to set bail and denied petitioner's habeas corpus application, holding that application of the statute and rule did not violate ex-post facto principles because petitioner's second crime occurred in 1978, when the statute and rule were in effect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for possession of more than 100 pounds of cannabis, a proscribed drug under section Fla. Stat. ch. 893.03(1)(c) (1977). The appellate court affirmed the conviction, holding that ch. 893.03(1)(c) was not unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court also found that the evidence sufficiently established possession of more than 100 pounds of cannabis, although the chemist expert witness did not separate the stems and stalks from the leaves before measuring the weight. Although it was not illegal to possess stalks and stems, the record indicated that appellant and others possessed more than 38,000 pounds of cannabis. The appellate court concluded that 100 pounds must logically have existed somewhere in that gross weight. Also, appellant's alleged search and seizure question was not properly preserved for appellate review. Further, the alleged discovery rule violation did not require reversal. Finally, appellant's attempt to disqualify the trial judge was meritless and a procedural error alleged in regard to certain evidence lacked the prejudicial effect to warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Florida parole and probation commission, changed its position on the open public meetings law, Fla. Stat. ch. 286.011 (1977), and stated that parole revocation meetings were constitutionally exempt from the public meetings law under Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 and art. IV, &sect; 8. Appellant prisoners had their paroles revoked without an open public meeting and filed a writ of habeas corpus challenging their parole revocations. The appellate court held that appellee's meetings were subject to the open public meetings law and that the revocation of appellant's conditional release was void ab initio. The appellate court ruled that placing the 1940 parole amendment to the constitution in the executive section of the constitution was functional and not indicative of executive branch exclusivity. The pardon power rested in the constitution, but the parole power depended upon legislation by the legislature. The appellate court left open the issue of the remedy for the violation pending further briefs and was concerned about allowing appellee to remake its decision in a public meeting to protect its own interests.</SPAN></P>

Appellee denied the application, finding that appellants failed to meet the criteria in Fla. Stat. ch. 659.03(2)(a), (b), (e), and (f). The court affirmed the order of denial. Although appellee erred by incorporating data not on the record on population projections into appellee's final order, the error was harmless because this data was not the only basis for appellee's finding that local conditions were not conducive to the proposed bank's success. Appellee's final order also considered the area's industry, local employment and salary statistics, the location of the proposed bank in relation to existing banks, and the past growth rates of existing banks. Thus, appellee had competent and substantial evidence on which to base its decision. Appellants were not deprived of their right to judicial process in an adversary hearing even though appellee did not process their application within the time period that appellants had to request a hearing; appellants were required to request or waive their right to a hearing before appellee decided on their application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a trial court order that granted defendant's motion to vacate his conviction and sentence and afforded him a new trial. The court was concerned with its duty to maintain procedural safeguards. The court noted that the trial court's action in accepting a nolo contendere plea and resentencing defendant in the same proceeding seemingly precluded the state from exercising its right to appeal the granting of the motion. The court held that insofar as the state was deprived of a reasonable opportunity to appeal, such actions were erroneous and required reversal. The court also noted that justice demanded that neither party be deprived of full and timely employment of rights and privileges extended to them under the law. This included the state's right of appeal, which was to be protected even in the face of procedural irregularities. Having determined that the state must be accorded its right to appeal and that the subsequent actions of the trial court thereby became invalid, the court further held that the vacating of defendant's conviction and sentence must be reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applied for review of a final order of the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission that denied its appeal from a development order issued by a county board of commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applied to a county board of commissioners for approval of a residential and commercial development of regional impact. The board denied petitioner's application, and the adjudicatory commission denied petitioner's appeal. Petitioner thereafter applied for judicial review of the commission's final order. In reversing the commission's final order and remanding the matter, the reviewing court concluded that the principal reason for the denial of petitioner's application was to preserve an area that served as a protective buffer for adjacent properties. The final order denied petitioner the right to use its property on the basis that its proposed use would deny the public certain free benefits. Because the commission failed to indicate any meaningful changes in the development plan that would enable petitioner to make any economically beneficial use of its land constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property without the consent or compensation of petitioner. The matter was remanded for entry of an order granting the application, conditioned to terminate if the county commenced condemnation proceedings within 30 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order affirming the denial of petitioner's development proposal was reversed and the matter was remanded for entry of an order approving the plan, as the denial of petition and the failure to indicate any changes that would be permissible constituted a taking of petitioner's property with consent or compensation. The order of approval was to be conditioned to terminate if the county commenced condemnation proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought review pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 9.100(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent entered an order that closed all files pertaining to paternity and petitioner corporation, some 20 months later, sought to challenge the order in the court, under Fla. R. App. P. 9.100(d). Petitioner also alleged that Fla. Stat. ch. 742.09 was unconstitutional. The court denied petitioner's request. First, the court held that rule 9.100(d) required petitioner to file its petition to review as soon as practical following rendition of the order sought to be reviewed. The appeals court held that petitioner's delay was unreasonable, especially after petitioner made no explanation for the delay. The court declined to determine the issue of the constitutionality of ch. 742.09 because petitioner did not present the issue to the trial court. According to the court, it was fundamental that jurisdiction was vested in the circuit courts, initially, to rule upon the constitutional validity of state statutes, and before an order was stricken down based upon a claim of constitutional invalidity the orderly processes of judicial administration dictated that the constitutional challenge first be presented to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, employees in two consolidated appeals, filed motions to dismiss appellants, employers', appeals. Appellees claimed that 1979 Fla. Laws, 79-40, &sect; 46(1), codified as Fla. Stat. ch. 440.271 (1979), violated Fla. Const. art. V by mandating that all appeals from the Florida workers' compensation deputy commissioners be heard by the Fla. 1st Dist. Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1979 Fla. Laws ch. 79-40, &sect; 46(1), codified as Fla. Stat. ch. 440.271 (1979), appellants, employers in consolidated appeals, filed their appeals from the Florida workers' compensation deputy commissioners (commissioners) with the court. Appellees, employees, filed motions to dismiss the appeals, claiming that &sect; 440.271 (1979) was unconstitutional and the court lacked jurisdiction. The court held that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(b)(2) gave the district courts authority to review administrative decisions as prescribed by law. Although administrative hearings were quasi-judicial, the administrative agencies were not established by Fla. Const. art. V, and thus were not in geographic relationships with the courts established under art. V. The court held that the Florida legislature had the power under art. V, &sect; 4(b)(2) to decide how judicial review of administrative action was to be implemented, and that &sect; 440.271 (1979) did not diminish the jurisdiction of any court. Thus, &sect; 440.271 (1979), that provided that the venue for all appeals from the commissioners was to be with the Fla. 1st Dist. Court of Appeals, was constitutional. Therefore, the court denied the motions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee condominium unit owners brought an action to invalidate a 99 year lease as violative of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Appellant developer's request for attorneys' fees for defending the action was denied. Appellant then filed a motion for attorneys' fees pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 718.125 (1978) because a reservation of jurisdiction was contained in the final judgment in favor of the prevailing party. The trial court granted appellee's motion to strike appellant's claim and on appeal, the order was affirmed. The court held that that the 99 year lease and contract between the parties was executed and in effect when ch. 718.125 became effective. The court ruled that even though ch. 718.125 was intended to be retroactive its application of attorneys' fees where none was bargained for materially changed the binding force of the agreement and impaired obligation of the existing lease and contract, which was unconstitutional in this case under U.S. Const. art.

Appellants argued that PIP and workers' compensation benefits did not compensate for pain and suffering and did not constitute duplicate coverage, therefore they should not be set off. Further, appellants argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 79-241, amending Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 627.727(1), clarified legislative intent and, as such, was a remedial statute to be retroactively applied. The court found that under the existing law at the time the insurance contract was entered into, PIP benefits and workers' compensation benefits were to be set off against uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to &sect; 627.727(1).

Appellee board, relying on the action, revoked appellant's license to practice medicine under Fla. Stat. ch. 458.1201(1)(p) (1977). Appellant argued that this statute was unconstitutional because it unlawfully delegated legislative authority. The reviewing court disagreed and upheld the ruling. Fla. Stat. ch. 458.1201(1)(p) (1977) permitted appellee to revoke a physician's license when a professional body, such as the hospital, took disciplinary action against the physician. However, the disciplinary action did not work an automatic forfeiture of a physician's license or other penalty. It was simply the basis of filing a complaint against the physician.

The court held that the trial court did not improperly limit appellant's insanity defense, although appellant failed to provide notice of his intent to plea insanity until the day of trial. The court held that appellant's evidence regarding his insanity defense was evidence that went to his propensity for intoxication and was insufficient to overcome the presumption of sanity. The evidence did not present a reasonable doubt of sanity which would cause the presumption to vanish and require the prosecution to overcome the reasonable doubt. The court further held that the trial court did not commit error by not instructing the jury on the insanity defense. According to the court, the notion of having to charge the jury on something on which there was no proof made a mockery of the trial where there was no support in the record for the instruction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the ruling that appellee real estate developers held valid and enforceable leases because state law required appellee agency to develop a comprehensive land use plan which came with a presumption of validity. Although the plan was revoked, the development authority was not prevented from taking future action on agreements already entered into. The court agreed with the trial court which found that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, on a motion for rehearing sought review of the decision of the circuit court which dismissed the insurance carrier of appellee driver from the automobile negligence action under the authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7762.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, challenged the decision of the circuit court to dismiss the insurance carrier of appellee driver pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7262, which the supreme court found to be an unconstitutional intrusion on the court's rulemaking power, from an automobile negligence action filed by appellants. The court affirmed the order of dismissal and judgment because the error of the circuit court in dismissing the insurance carrier was not reversible. Appellant husband's admission that he was not aware of the color of the light when he entered the intersection, the positive testimony of appellee and witnesses that appellee entered on a green light, and other facts revealed to the jury prevented the court from finding reversible error. The state of the evidence was such that a verdict for appellants would have been incredible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal and judgment of the circuit court because the evidence prevented the court from speculating that the jury might have found liability on the part of appellee driver if the jury had known that appellee was insured; therefore dismissal of appellee's insurance carrier from the case was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of the declaratory statement of the Florida Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC), which held that the grievance procedure and representation provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 447.609 (1977) and Fla. Stat. ch. 447.301(2) authorized appellee union to represent union members in a civil service appeal of a disciplinary action under Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., Code &sect; 2-47.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee union was granted a declaratory statement from the Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC) sustaining its asserted right to represent county employees in the hearing phase of the civil service disciplinary process provided for by Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., Code &sect; 2-47. The basis of the PERC order was Fla. Stat. ch. 447.609 (1977), which authorized appellee to represent employees in the grievance process regarding the terms and conditions of their employment. Appellant county sought review claiming that only a licensed attorney could represent an employee in code &sect; 2-47 civil disciplinary hearings. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 447.401 explicitly recognized that civil service appeals were significantly different from grievance procedures, and that the remedies were mutually exclusive. The court held that Chapter 447, the Public Employees Relations Act (PERA) did not control civil service appeal procedures or provide any procedural rights in respect to appeals under code &sect; 2-47. The PERC decision was quashed. The court did not address the unlawful practice of law issue because appellant did not raise it and the record was inadequate for a determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Revenue challenged a Florida trial court ruling, which held that &quot;household goods&quot; as defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 192.001(11)(a), owned by nonresidents but not held for commercial purposes or resale, were not subject to ad valorem taxation under Florida's tax laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee tax appraiser filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment as to whether household goods and personal effects of nonresidents were subject to ad valorem taxation. Appellee's affidavit stated that in order to properly assess the household goods and personal effects of nonresidents, he would need to add approximately 12 people to his staff, and that the estimated revenues would be far outweighed by the costs of administration and assessment. In the interim, the state Attorney General issued several opinions which provided that household goods and personal effects of nonresidents were taxable. Thereafter, the trial court issued a ruling which held that &quot;household goods&quot; as defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 192.001(11)(a), owned by non-residents, were not subject to ad valorem taxation under Florida's tax laws. Appellant Department of Revenue sought review. The appeals court affirmed. The court reasoned that although household goods were taxable under previous statutes, after the passage of Fla. Stat. ch. 200.01 (1967), such property was effectively eliminated from the operation of the taxing statutes, regardless of the residency of the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the trial court ruling, which held that household goods and personal effects of nonresidents were not subject to ad valorem taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor yelled obscenities to police officer while leaning from rear window of a car. Officers stopped the vehicle and observed a bottle of rum in plain view, three glasses containing rum drinks, and smelled alcohol on minor's breath. Minor was adjudicated a delinquent because he was convicted of disorderly conduct and possession of alcoholic beverages. He appealed, claiming the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the disorderly conduct charge violated his right to free speech, and the officer did not have probable cause to stop the vehicle. The court held that the circuit court had jurisdiction, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 39.02, but it reversed the disorderly conduct verdict because minor's words were within the ambit of constitutionally protected speech. It affirmed the conviction for possession of alcohol. Minor's unprovoked and obscene verbal attack gave officers at least a reasonable suspicion that minor had violated the municipal ordinance and that further inquiry was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessor challenged an order which granted a temporary injunction against collection of adjusted rents under a condominium recreational lease. The injunction arose out of an action by appellee lessee, which was the condominium association, under a 99-year lease for condominium recreational facilities. The trial court enjoined appellant from having collected adjusted rentals based upon a cost of living increase. The trial court found that the adjustment was at an interval less than 10 years, and that such was in contravention of Fla. Stat. ch. 711.63(6) (1974). The statute prohibited cost of living increases on condominium recreational leases at intervals of less than 10 years. The controversy presented related to the effective date of the statute, and whether it applied to the facts. The court found that a five-year provision, set out in the agreement for recreational facilities, would have contravened the 10-year requirement, if applicable. However, as numerous contracts predated the effective date of the statute, so that the statute was inapplicable, the trial court erred. The court reversed the decision and vacated the injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The temporary injunction in favor of appellee lessee, against collection of adjusted rents by appellant lessor was reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings. The court found that the rental adjustment was at an interval less than 10 years, and that such was in contravention of the applicable statutory section, but it was inapplicable to the case at bar due to contracts which predated the effective statute date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's refusal to suppress evidence, to wit, marijuana seized pursuant to a search warrant. A police officer had spotted the marijuana growing on defendant's balcony, and then obtained a search warrant for defendant's residence. On appeal, the court held that the affidavit supporting the warrant was sufficient even though it failed to affirmatively allege where the officer was standing when he saw the marijuana. Although the warrant would have been illegally obtained had the officer viewed the marijuana while standing in a spot in which the officer had no right to stand, Fla. Stat. ch. 933.04 did not require an affidavit for a search warrant to negate every possible attack upon it. To attack the affidavit supporting the warrant, defendant was required to do more than suggest that the officer might possibly have invaded defendant's privacy in order to view the marijuana. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff father challenged his award of damages, arguing that the trial court erred by instructing the jury to deduct the insurance money from damages and by dismissing defendants' insurance carrier from the suit. The reviewing court reversed, holding that the pleadings did not raise an issue regarding plaintiffs' personal injury protection benefits, nor was there adequate proof of the amount of those benefits that were paid or payable. Thus, the trial court erred by instructing the jury to deduct insurance money from plaintiff father's damages. Further, the reviewing court held that Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers were convicted of perjury for falsely testifying before a grand jury that they did not give drugs to confidential informants in exchange for information. Appellants contended that the trial erred in admitting evidence of electronic recordings of their conversations which were obtained without an intercept warrant. The court affirmed, holding that appellee state was not required to obtain intercept warrants before tape recording conversations between appellants and another officer who agreed to the tape recording. The court held that the tapes were admissible. The court held that the law was well established that the use of secret informers by the government was not per se unconstitutional and the U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that appellant was employed by the State and that after being stopped at a traffic check and arrested, appellant became hysterical and, while in this emotional state, she expressed her negative opinion of state. The court found that, although appellant identified herself as a state employee to the arresting officer, appellant was not on duty at the time. The court also found that following this incident a report was made by the Sheriff to appellant's supervisor indicating concern that the incident might effect his department's relationships with the appellant's agency. The court reinstated appellant finding that mere words that might have offended the sensibilities of the deputy sheriff, and possibly others within hearing, without more, cannot be the precipitating cause of discharge from employment of an off-duty state employee without a positive and unequivocal showing of a connection between that conduct and some legitimate public interest that would be detrimentally affected by it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Department of Insurance issued an emergency order suspending appellant insurance agent's license and providing for a hearing shortly thereafter. This action was taken after appellant obstructed appellee's attempts to investigate appellant's books and records, and appellant continued to withhold insurance premiums from insurers resulting in the cancellation of her insured's automobile liability policies. The court affirmed appellee's emergency suspension order. According to the court, the constitution did not require a full-pledged formal hearing. Moreover, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 120.60(6) (1978) was not facially invalid for failing to require a hearing so long as the opportunity for a hearing was in fact provided. Finally, the court concluded that appellant relied on the emergency suspension order alone to demonstrate that she had no opportunity to rebut the charges before the suspension order was entered. The court, however, held that appellant did have an opportunity to rebut those charges by the very facts recited in the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

Appellee admitted that it had no suspicion of unlawful activity on the boat when it made the stop. Subsequently, the occupants of the boat, appellants, were convicted for possession of marijuana.

However, during their appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States held that unless an officer had a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was not registered, a stop to check registration would violate U.S. Const. amend.

After notice and hearing on a proposed assessment of sales tax on the meals, a hearing officer recommended that the sales tax assessment be dismissed because it violated 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1513. The Florida Department of Administrative Hearings adopted the hearing officer's findings of fact, but concluded the assessment was valid, as a matter of law, and should be sustained. Appellee Florida Department of Revenue ordered the assessment of sales tax on the packaged meals. On appeal, the court affirmed the order, concluding that the packaged meals were not an export good exempt from sales tax, that the meals were included in ticket prices and sold in the state within the meaning of the sales tax statute, and that the assessment was not in conflict with federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for vehicular homicide and causing a death by operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Appellant asserted that the state failed to establish that the person who took appellant's blood sample was a member of any of the classes of persons authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 322.261(2)(b) to withdraw blood samples. The reviewing court agreed. The court found that the person who took appellant's blood sample was not such an authorized individual. Therefore, notwithstanding the lack of any impropriety in the analysis of the blood sample taken from appellant, the court reversed on that point and remanded for a new trial. Moreover, at appellant's sentencing hearing, the sentencing judge explained his reasons for appellant's severe sentence, including appellant's decision to stand trial. Appellant's choice of plea should not have played any part in the determination of his sentence. Consideration of that factor in sentencing appellant was also reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver and his wife sought review of an order by the circuit court dismissing appellee driver's liability insurance carrier under Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7262 in an automobile negligence action. Appellants argued that the order of dismissal was erroneous based on a ruling by the Florida supreme court that ch. 627.7262 was an unconstitutional intrusion upon the supreme court's rule-making power. The court stated that it did not believe that the supreme court ruling abrogated the fundamental principle of appellate review. Error was reversible only when, considering all the facts peculiar to the particular case under scrutiny, it was reasonably probable that a result more favorable to an appellant would have been reached if the error had not been committed. The court found that the overwhelming amount of evidence against appellants made it unlikely that the jury would have found liability on the part of appellee even if they had known he was insured. The court affirmed the order of dismissal and the judgment finding no reversible error on the part of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant was unable to examine the jury concerning the defense of insanity because of the ground rules set forth by the trial court. The court noted that appellant filed his notice of intention to rely upon an insanity defense, and prohibiting a voir dire examination of prospective jurors concerning that defense was error. The court further noted that after appellant's trial, the Florida Supreme Court declared Fla. Stat. ch. 921.131(1), unconstitutional because it raised an irrebuttable presumption of intent. In appellant's bifurcated trial, he was not allowed to show a lack of intent to commit the crime of escape. Finding a denial of due process, the court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court then issued a mandate commanding that further proceedings be had in the case in accordance with its opinion. Notwithstanding the mandate, the trial court ordered a stay pending a final determination by the state supreme court on appellee's certiorari review. The court held that the trial court was without authority under Fla. R. App. P. 9.310 to enter the stay because the court, not the trial court, was the &quot;lower tribunal&quot; for purposes of the rule. Appellee contended that the trial court's stay order was entered pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 59.13 (1977), not Rule 9.310, therefore, the order was not reviewable by the court. The court disagreed, holding that ch. 59.13 did not apply because the subject of the review initiated by appellee in the supreme court was the court's reversal of the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of appellee. As such, the court held that the trial court had no direct concern with the supreme court's review. The court vacated the stay order and directed that further proceedings be had in accordance with the mandate already issued.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with appellee commission that the letter, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 380.06(4)(a) (1977) was binding on appellant and barred appellant from pursuing an appeal to appellee. The court also held that when appellant failed to request review of the dismissal pursuant to county code provisions, appellant was barred from collaterally attacking the validity of the letter in court.

Appellant was legally blind and was tendered a position as a physical education instructor at an elementary school, which was withdrawn when appellees discovered appellant's disability. The court agreed that the trial court properly denied appellant's federal claim when employment was not a primary objective of appellees federal financial aid, when the action more properly lay in federal court, and when appellant's claim was groundless on the merits. The court agreed that appellant's state claim was legitimate, and the trial court's remedy that ordered appellees to hire appellant on a trial basis was appropriate, when the clear language of the statute prohibited discrimination unless it could be shown the applicant was unqualified because of the disability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged a final judgment from the trial court (Florida) denying appellant's requested agricultural classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant purchased the subject property for more than three times the agricultural assessment of the land. Appellant planned to develop the land as a commercial property or to resell it. Before closing on the property, the land was changed from agricultural to commercial. From 1971 when the land was purchased through 1974, the land continued to be used for agricultural purposes. When appellant applied for agricultural classification of his land in 1974, the tax assessor denied appellant's application. Eventually, the trial court entered a final judgment denying appellant's agricultural classification. Reversing the trial court order for denial of the application for agricultural classification, the court held that the statutory requirements had been met. The court explained that in interpreting the statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461 (Supp. 1978), seven factors must be considered in determining whether land was classified for &quot;bona fide agricultural purposes.&quot; The appellate court noted that the presence of all or any one factor in particular was not necessary for the rebuttal of the presumption created when land was sold for more than three times its agricultural value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's final judgment denying appellant landowner's requested agricultural classification. The court held that the trial court had misconstrued the statutory requirement for determining whether the land was classified for &quot;bona fide agricultural purposes&quot; and that the intent of the use of the land had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a landowner, sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court (Florida) that held that appellant did not meet his burden of proving that appellee county's action in denying appellant's application to reclassify his land under appellee's master plan, which was authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3161 (1977) et seq., was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconstitutional, and that denied him injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3161 (1977) et seq., appellee, a county, created a master plan dealing with land use in the county, classified appellant landowner's property as agricultural, and denied appellant's application to reclassify the property as residential. Appellant sued for a declaratory decree and an injunction, and the trial court found that the denial had a rational basis and entered judgment for appellee. On review, the court held that the enactment of the master plan was a proper exercise in appellee's police power and was reasonably required to meet the needs of the public welfare in general. Thus, the master plan was constitutional. The grant of a reclassification to other landowners did not prove that the denial of appellant's application was unreasonable or that appellant was denied due process. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying appellant, a landowner, injunctive relief on declaratory action against appellee, a county. The court held that appellee's master plan for land use was reasonably related to the public welfare in general and was thus constitutional, and that appellant was not denied due process when appellee denied his application to reclassify his land although similar, but not identical, applications were granted.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 193.481(1) (1977) ad valorem real property assessments or for an offsetting credit in the amount of their Fla. Stat. ch. 211.02 (1977) excise taxes paid. The court affirmed the judgment. Notwithstanding Fla. Stat. ch. 211.13 (1977), the assessor of a subsurface oil and gas leasehold could take into consideration the value of the oil and gas which was the subject of the lease. The court found that if the value of oil and gas yet to be captured could lawfully increase the appraisal of the subsurface leasehold held by a producer, the resulting ad valorem real property tax could not be considered as paid or reduced by ch. 211.02 excise taxes remitted by the same producer on the value of oil and gas produced each year. The court concluded that there was no legislative intent to terminate the excise tax nor have the court validly determine a setoff or credit. Any setoff or credit would be unconstitutional in Florida.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge found the charter amendment and the implementing zoning ordinances did not bear a rational relationship to a valid municipal purpose and that the ordinances were confiscatory as applied to appellees' property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the lower court properly denied appellant restaurant's application for injunctive relief, but the court found that the lower court erred in finding the proposed clean air act was constitutional. The lower court was restricted to a determination of the validity of the proposal. Once found not valid, the judicial function terminated. Thus, the court reinstated the stricken language. The court held that the lower court rightly refused to enjoin the election. If an examination of the proposed amendment revealed that it was legally operative in part, even though it might ultimately be adjudged unconstitutional, its submission to the electorate was not restrained. An individual, piecemeal attack upon a portion of the proposal, as opposed to a complete attack, was not sufficient for the lower court to enjoin the election, or to delete language. The lower court's determination that appellee county had authority to regulate smoking in restaurants was premature, injunctive relief was properly denied, and the proposed ordinance was the proper subject of a special referendum.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted both a temporary injunction and the declaratory judgment. Defendant citizen sought an interlocutory appeal. The court reversed, holding that the trial court not restrain the holding of the special election because there was no showing that the proposed ordinance was invalid on its face, or that the special election itself was invalid or illegal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the organizers of a proposed bank, sought review of a decision of respondent agency that denied their application for authority to organize a corporation for the purpose of conducting a state chartered general banking business. The application was denied on the ground that it did not meet the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 659.03 (1977). In its final order, respondent agency noted that two of those criteria could not be remedied because convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the proposed bank because of its location and because local conditions did not assure reasonable promise of successful operation because of competition. Petitioners argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 659.03 was unconstitutional in that its provisions constituted an improper delegation of legislative authority. The reviewing court disagreed and affirmed the decision denying petitioners' application because respondent agency followed the appropriate legislative standards and guidelines in making its determination and sufficiently elucidated its reasons for its discretionary denial of the bank charter application on the ground that the criteria set out in Fla.

In a declaratory judgment action, appellant argued that ch. 447.401 was unconstitutional regarding refused union representation to non-members, and that discrimination was prohibited by Fla.

The trial court granted appellee and intervenor attorney general's motion for dismissal, holding that jurisdiction was preempted by the state public employees' relations commission.

On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion for directed verdict because appellee's exclusive remedy was provided by the worker's compensation act under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.04(2) (1973). Although appellant's manager indicated it was his intention that appellee be covered by appellant's worker's compensation policy, the policy made no reference to coverage of a dinner theater or to dinner theater employees, and did not reflect an endorsement providing coverage for independent contractors. The court concluded that the facts presented by the record showed an ambiguous policy and conflicting testimony regarding workmen's compensation coverage for appellee.

Pursuant to Fla.

On appeal, defendants challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4). The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, ruling that defendant's constitutional arguments were not presented to the trial court. The court concluded that the trial court's order was a discretionary decision which it declined to disturb; furthermore, the order was essentially favorable to defendants in that it allowed only plaintiff unit owners to deposit their rents pending the litigation. Finally, the court held that Fla.

Petitioner was issued a certificate of accountancy from the university. Petitioner took and passed a two-part CPA exam in another state and practiced for a number of years. After moving to the state, petitioner sought a reciprocal certificate of accountancy from the state board of accountancy (board). After a hearing, the board denied petitioner a reciprocal certificate based upon the statutory requirement found in Fla. Stat. ch. 473.08(1)(c) that an applicant must be a graduate of at least a four-year accredited college or university course. Petitioner filed a writ of certiorari. Petitioner alleged that the requirement of a baccalaureate degree was not specifically contained in the statutes. Thus, the board's denial was arbitrary and improper. The court disagreed and denied the petition for certiorari. Fla. Stat. ch. 473.08 specifically provided that an applicant for the CPA exam must be a graduate of at least a four-year accredited college or university. The court found that the common ordinary meaning of the statutes required a bachelor's degree in accounting, which petitioner did not have.</SPAN></P>

In the present case, such a board existed and respondent did not contest that fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an accident victim and others, brought suit against defendants, a minor and his parents, after defendant minor dived into a swimming pool and landed on plaintiff accident victim's back. Defendants who were permanent residents of Canada brought a motion to quash service of process as to defendant minor's father arguing that Fla. Stat. ch. 48.193(1)(b) was unconstitutional because it failed to satisfy the minimum contacts requirements of due process. The trial court denied the motion holding that the statute was a reasonable extension of its jurisdiction over visitors to the state and did not violate constitutional due process. On appeal, the court transferred the issue to the state's supreme court because it found no state appellate decision passing upon the constitutionality of Fla.

Stat. ch. 849.01 (1975) by permitting another person to engage in a game of cards on his premises. The trial court dismissed the information, holding that habitual use was an essential element of the offense and it was not alleged in the information. On appeal, the court read ch. 849.01 as creating two separate offenses. The court opined that the first part of the statute contained an element requiring proof of habitual use of the premises for gambling, while the second part did not. The court found that defendant was charged under the second part. The court noted that the Florida Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of ch. 849.01 against vagueness and overbreadth challenges. While the court expressed reluctance to conclude that the legislature intended to classify an occasional social game in one's home as felony gambling, it vacated the trial court's order that dismissed the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police officers were convicted on four counts for a burglary of a restaurant, which they appealed. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that defendants had not shown that their constitutional rights were violated by the presence of cameras in the courtroom. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendants' motion to suppress the tape-recorded conversation based upon Fla. Stat. ch. 934.02(1) (1977) because the tape recording was not an interception of a communication by a common carrier. The court also held that defendants failed to present a reasonable theory that the admission of the condensed version of the tape recording would have helped their defense. The court affirmed the denial of defendants' motion for a new trial because there was sufficient evidence to put them at the scene of the crime, and the tape recording tied them to the crime as perpetrators. The court ruled that defendants were given sufficient latitude to show that one of the witnesses was prejudiced against them. The court held that Fla. R. Crim.

The trial court initially entered two judgments and sentences against appellant. The first judgment held appellant guilty and sentenced him to death on the murder charge and 15 years prison on the assault charge. The judgment retained the trial court's jurisdiction to resentence appellant to life imprisonment if the death penalty was later found unconstitutional on appeal with the assault sentence to be served consecutively. The second judgment was for the assault charge. The state supreme court did reverse appellant's death sentence and remanded back to the trial court who had entered an impermissible general sentence of life imprisonment on the murder and assault convictions. Appellant sought review of this general sentence. The court found the new sentence by the trial court had to specify whether the life sentence was to run concurrently with or consecutively to the 15-year sentence on the assault. The court vacated the trial court amended judgment, reversed, and remanded the case back for further proceedings in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The orders required defendant, who had pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of sexual battery, to be under the responsibility of Florida State Hospital, which would thereby impose responsibilities upon petitioner that were not statutorily authorized. On appeal, the court found that Fla.

The court held that respondent would be acting in excess of the circuit court's statutory jurisdiction if his orders were carried out by asserting authority over petitioner.

The issue was whether appellant was entitled to a hearing within appellee department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state department of general services denied appellant contractor's claims for compensation and extensions of time under the parties' contract. Appellee denied appellant a hearing on whether claims were submitted to the architect within the times required by the contract. Appellee argued that the court had no jurisdiction, because the contract reserved to appellee alone the determination of claims under the contract. On appeal, the court held that the contract called for agency action by order, as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 120.52(9), which potentially affected appellant's substantial rights, and therefore it had jurisdiction under the Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68. Although letters sent to appellant by appellee did not meet the formal requirements for orders, the court held that they were orders. The court remanded the case for further proceedings under either the Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57(1) or (2). The court rejected completely appellee's claim that the appeal was barred because the state had not waived sovereign immunity, and assessed costs and attorney's fees against appellee under the Act, Fla.

Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review the order. The appellate court denied the writ, holding that because Florida assessed income taxes on an apportionment basis there was no error in including the gain on the sale of foreign stock in petitioner's tax base, and that the granting of equitable apportionment under Fla. Stat. ch. 214.73 (1973) would have violated the statutory requirement that gain includable for federal income tax purposes be included in petitioner's tax base. The court also found that the legislature intended installment payments on sales predating the adoption of ch. 220 to be taxable.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was served with interrogatories, a request for admissions and a request to produce.

Appellant's motion for rehearing was denied. The court reversed and remanded with directions to allow appellant to answer the request for admissions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal offender sought review of his convictions for false imprisonment and battery. The victim was in a parking lot with her stepdaughter when appellant and another man got out of a car. The man with appellant grabbed the child, putting her in the car, while appellant grabbed the victim in a bear hug and restrained her while she struggled to get free. Appellant alleged that he could not be convicted of false imprisonment because the restraint was not imposed by threat or in a secret manner. The court found that the wording of Fla. Stat. ch. 787.02(1)(a) (1977), did not require that the restraint be secretly accomplished, or done by threat; it could be accomplished by force alone. Regarding the battery conviction, the court stated that both it and the false imprisonment were committed in the course of the &quot;bear hug.&quot; Because battery was a lesser included offense of false imprisonment, the court determined that it was error to adjudicate appellant guilty of battery. The court found appellant's issue regarding the refusal to allow proffered defense testimony meritless.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to rising coal prices, the Florida legislature enacted a law to allow for the adjustment of contract prices to reflect the rising costs of coal. Realizing that some contractors were making windfall profits as a result of the law, an amendment to the law was passed to provide relief to the state under the contracts. Appellee contractor sued appellant agency after appellant refused to pay appellee under a previously existing contract. When the trial court ruled that the amendment to the contract law was inapplicable retroactively and ruled for appellant, appellee sought review. On appeal, the court disagreed with the trial court ruling that the retroactive amendment, Fla. Stat. ch. 76-174, was inapplicable to appellee's contract with the state. The court reversed and remanded, holding that ch. 76-174 was a valid retroactive amendment to the contract law because its purpose and effect was to specify criteria for intended relief and its availability was limited to cases which demonstrated a real or genuine need. The court certified the case to the supreme court for determination of the question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank, having learned that appellee comptroller authorized appellee rival bank to open a branch across the street from appellant, asked appellee comptroller for a hearing on that application. Appellee comptroller declined to grant a hearing, contending that appellant lacked standing. Although there was sufficient time to seek judicial review, appellant instead sought declaratory and injunctive relief from a trial court. The trial court dismissed based on precedent declaring that the proper means of review was via a judicial review petition. Appellant then again asked for a hearing, which appellee comptroller denied based on the prior hearing, after which appellant then sought judicial review from the trial court. Unfortunately, the judicial review petition was now untimely, and the trial court dismissed. Both matters were consolidated on appeal. The court affirmed as to both, holding that appellant should have sought judicial review initially, within the time set by state law.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 796.07 was unconstitutional as embracing multiple subjects not expressed in the title was without merit. Petitioner was correct that respondent state agency impermissibly increased the recommended penalty without a review of the complete record in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57(1)(b)(9). However, reversal was not required and instead, in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68(9)(a), the court modified the penalty imposed. Respondent violated Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from a judgment and life sentence for first-degree murder. The court on appeal found no prejudicial error in the trial court's denial of appellant's challenge for cause of a prospective juror whom appellant later struck peremptorily. The prospective juror simply stated that she had great respect for police officers and that it would be difficult for her to believe that a police officer had testified untruthfully. That feeling did not disqualify the prospective juror. Appellant had not demonstrated that, as a result of his exhaustion of peremptory challenges, a juror served whom appellant would otherwise have struck. The trial court did not err in charging the jury that a killing perpetrated in the course of a rape was first-degree murder. The court rejected appellant's argument that the state could not prove rape because that offense no longer existed. The court determined that regardless of the technical name by which such conduct was then known and condemned by statute, the law presumed premeditation if appellant killed his victim in the course of certain conduct, and the result was first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer sought review of an interlocutory order of the trial court (Florida), which denied appellant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in appellee forklift owner's third party action against appellee, which alleged that appellee was liable for injuries suffered by a user of the forklift.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual brought suit against appellee forklift owner for injuries the individual received while operating appellee's forklift. Appellee filed a third party complaint against appellant manufacturer, alleging that appellant was liable for the forklift user's injuries. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court denied the motion. The court reversed, concluding that the trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over appellant because appellant did not have minimum contacts with the state. The court found that appellant's only connection with the state was that it manufactured forklift parts that were used throughout the state, which was insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction. The court further found that appellant did not have minimum contacts with the state because appellant presented an unrefuted affidavit stating that it was not licensed to do business in the state, that it did not engage in business in the state, and that it maintained no offices, agents, employees, or bank accounts in the state. Finally the court found that appellant did not avail itself of the privilege of doing business in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the interlocutory order denying appellant manufacturer's motion to dismiss because appellant did not have minimum contacts with the state, nor did it purposely avail itself of the privilege of doing business in the state, and was, therefore, not subject to personal jurisdiction in the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant filed a claim against appellee estate on June 25, 1975. Fla. Stat. ch. 733.211 (1973) provided that claims against estates upon which no action was taken, were barred after three years from the date the claim was filed. As such, appellant had until June 25, 1978 in which to take action on her claim. Two days after appellant filed hr claim, Florida's new probate code became law and included Fla. Stat. ch. 733.709 (1975), which reduced the period of time for the enforcement of undisposed claims to one year. The effective date for Fla. Stat. ch. 733.709 was January 1, 1976. Appellant took no action on her claim until February 21, 1977. The trial court applied Fla. Stat. ch. 733.709 to appellant's claim and barred it as of June 25, 1976. The court reversed and held that appellant's claim was governed by Fla. Stat. ch. 733.211, which gave her three years from the date the claim was filed to take action. The court found that the legislature failed to provide a reasonable time for action on claims filed before the effective date for Fla. Stat. ch.. 733.709, and therefore, it could not apply to claims filed before the effective date.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was denied under Fla. Stat. ch. 467.08(1)(b)(5) (1973), which required graduation from a school of architecture approved by respondent. Petitioner appealed. The court held that ch. 467.08(1)(b)(5) unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to respondent in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The court reasoned that ch. 467.08(1)(b)(5) did not establish standards to guide respondent in approving schools of architecture or equivalent training. Additionally, respondent had not developed any objective criteria to be used in determining whether petitioner had training equivalent to that of an architecture degree. The court vacated respondent's decision to deny petitioner's application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence from the trial court (Florida), which found him guilty of involuntary sexual battery with force not likely to cause physical injury, false imprisonment, and weapons charges. Appellant claimed that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the sex crime required certain intent and that it improperly refused to certify appellant as a mentally disordered sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his convictions for sexual battery, false imprisonment, and weapons violations, appellant argued that the evidence was improperly seized, his right to cross-examine the victim regarding her reluctance to testify was unduly restricted, the trial court failed to instruct the jury that intent was an element of sexual battery, his sentence was improper, and that the trial court refused to certify him as a mentally disordered sex offender. The court affirmed the convictions. The court stated that the officers had probable cause when they seized the evidence from appellant's car. The court stated that the scope of appellant's cross-examination was not relevant to the victim's credibility. The court held that because appellant's sexual organ was the object of the crime, specific intent was not required; the act of rape itself inferred intent. The court did not inquire into the reasons in imposing the sentence because it was within the statutory limits. However, the court reversed the sentence because, after a court appointed psychiatrist reported his findings, probable cause under Fla. Stat. ch.917.14 (1)(b) (1975) existed to certify and re-sentence appellant as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions and held that probable cause existed to seize the evidence. The court determined that appellee state was not required to prove intent as an element of sexual battery. The court upheld the length of the sentence because it was within the statutory limits, but reversed its imposition because the trial court failed to certify appellant as a sexual offender when it had statutory probable cause to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for obtaining property by worthless check in violation of Fla.

Stat. ch. 832.05 (3) (1975), and should not have been subjected to criminal prosecution. The court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 832.05(4) (1975) specifically provided that payment of a dishonored check did not constitute a defense or grounds for dismissal of the charges. The criminal act was complete when the maker drew a check knowing at the time of such drawing that he did not have sufficient funds on deposit to pay the check when it was presented. Fla. Stat. ch. 832.07 (1975) contained a presumption of appellant's intent to defraud when the dishonored check was produced. The court found that the presumption was constitutional because it gave appellee state the choice of relying on the presumption or specifically proving appellant's intent to defraud.

Stat. ch. 85.031(2) (1975), sought review of a judgment from circuit court (Florida) in favor of appellant, holder of a prior valid recorded security interest in aircraft in action for foreclosure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment in favor of appellee, valid security interest holder, in action for foreclosure against appellee, purchaser of property at mechanic's lien sale pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 85.031(2) (1975). Appellee held valid and duly recorded security interest in aircraft. When first and second purchasers of aircraft defaulted on note, appellee unsuccessfully sought to repossess aircraft. Subsequently, mechanic performed repairs at request of second purchaser. When second purchaser defaulted on that bill, mechanic obtained lien and property was sold to appellant. The court held that a sale, pursuant to ch. 85.301(2), of property subject to a valid security interest was valid and gave the purchaser title to the property, but still subject to any prior recorded security interests where the holder of the security interest had no actual knowledge of the sale. The court found that to hold otherwise would deprive due process to the holder of the recorded security interest. Noting that the mechanic's lien seller/lienor would be answerable to the purchaser for any misrepresentations, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff heirs sought a declaration that they possessed a remainder interest in defendants', grantor and son, real property. They alleged that at the time of the conveyance, grantor and defendant grantor were living on the property as a homestead and that the attempted conveyance to defendant son by defendant grantor was in derogation of the title. The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice for failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the deed from grantor to himself and defendant grantor was void ab initio because the attempted conveyance was in derogation of two requirements under the 1885 Florida Constitution, joinder and valuable consideration. Moreover, Fla. Stat. ch. 689.11(2) (1977) did not apply to validate a homestead deed that was void ab initio due to constitutional infirmities. The deed was also voidable by plaintiffs because their inchoate remainder interest in the homestead was subject to alienation only if the constitutional requirements of joinder and consideration were complied with. The statute could not have dissolved either an inchoate or vested right, which was of constitutional magnitude.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant was arrested for murder in the first degree, the offense was classified by statute as a capital offense. Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court found the statutory procedure for imposing the death penalty was unconstitutional. Appellant was then charged under an information with first degree murder. While awaiting trial, the state enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141 (1972) (Ch. 921), which reclassified first degree murder as a capital crime. Appellant was tried under the information after Ch. 921 became effective, and sought review of his conviction and sentence to life in prison on grounds that the lower court committed fundamental error in trying him under an information for a capital offense. The court found that Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 provided that no person could be tried for a capital crime without presentment or indictment by a grand jury. The court concluded that if an accused was to be tried for a capital offense, he had to be charged by an indictment, regardless of whether an information had previously been filed against him, which was valid when filed. Finding appellant's trial under information was void, the court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari, reversed the order taxing costs to defendant, and remanded. Upon defendant entering a plea of insanity to charges of sexual battery and kidnapping, the state sought permission to have a psychiatrist examine defendant. The examination was to occur only on the condition that defense counsel was present. The facts indicated that defense counsel never received a message indicating when the examination was going to be held, and defense counsel never appeared and defendant refused to answer any questions. The state then filed a motion to tax the psychiatrist's bill to defendant. Viewing the motion by the state as a motion to tax costs, the court held that the lower court was without authority to enter the order under Fla. Stat. ch. 939.01, where defendant had not been convicted at the time the request was made or the order was entered. Even if the state's motion was one for sanctions, the court held that under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.220(j), such sanctions could only be imposed where a discovery rule was violated. As such, the sanctions were held improper where the court found no discovery rule compelling a psychiatrist examination of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that as an arm of the judiciary, it was immune for taxation. Respondents contended that petitioner contractually bound itself to have paid the taxes pursuant to the contract with the bank. The court stated that petitioner was an arm and part of the judiciary and the judiciary was immune from taxation. The court stated that it was common knowledge that lenders universally required borrowers to assume the burden of any taxes imposed upon a loan transaction. However, to have imposed a tax upon a note given by a tax immune arm of government was an indirect action. The legislature was prohibited from doing indirectly what it could not have done directly.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. ch. 337.143 (1975) directed appellant Department of Transportation to adjust the unit price for materials used in roadway construction contracts. Appellee asphalt contractor elected to submit its contracts for recomputation in accordance with ch. 337.143 as amended in 1974. Appellant refused to pay the statutory adjustment on one of appellee's contracts, relying upon a 1976 amendment to ch. 337.143 that was enacted to prevent windfall profits. Appellee sued. Appellant counter-claimed seeking reimbursement for other sums paid under the 1974 statute. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment and awarded the statutory adjustment amount plus interest and costs. Appellant sought review, claiming that the 1974 act did not vest rights in asphalt contractors that would preclude further legislative action. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the 1976 amendment gave contractors a choice to participate, and that appellee had elected to participate under the 1974 act and not the 1976 act; therefore, his payment must be determined under the 1974 act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner bankrupt company operated retail stores and sold on credit. Petitioner paid sales tax on its sales, but requested a sales tax refund pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26 (1975) for uncollectible credit sales. Respondent state comptroller and the department of revenue denied petitioner's claim for refund and denied petitioner's request for a rehearing. The court had jurisdiction to review respondents' final action and affirmed. The court disagreed with petitioner's contention that it was entitled to a refund under Fla. Stat. ch. 212.17(3) (1975) because the statute only authorized the extension of a credit or set-off against future tax liability and did not authorize a refund of sales taxes. Because petitioner filed bankruptcy and would not have future sales or tax returns, there was nothing against which any credit for &quot;bad debts&quot; could be set-off. Thus, the court held that respondent was justified in its refusal to make such refund. Finally, the court rejected petitioner's argument that denial of the refund sought was a denial of due process and equal protection. The classifications created by Fla. Stat. ch. 212.17(3) (1975) were reasonable and not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The state requested that the trial court's sentencing order sentence defendant to a three year mandatory and minimum term of imprisonment without parole pursuant to Fla.

The court remanded the case to the trial court with a direction to amend the sentencing order to require that defendant spend a minimum of three years in prison in accordance with ch. 775.087(2). The court held that precedent had established that ch. 775.087(2) was not unconstitutional or cruel and unusual. That precedent had determined that where a sentence was one that had been established by the legislature and was not cruel and unusual on its face, it would sustain an attack brought on due process, equal protection, or separation of power grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant revenue department sought review of an order of the trial court (Florida), which held Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-4.13(22) void and unenforceable, and granted summary judgment to appellee, a land seller and residential developer, after denying appellant the right to apply a tax that was based on both the value of land appellee conveyed to a purchaser and the value of improvements to be made at a later date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant revenue department argued that because appellee was both a seller and residential builder, Fla. Admin Code Ann. r. 12A-4.13(22) allowed appellant to compute the tax due from appellee, a land seller and developer, on the basis of the price paid by a purchaser for the land plus the consideration anticipated to be paid for improvements to be made at a later date. The court disagreed, ruling that Fla. Stat. chs. 201.02, 201.021 allowed a tax that was based only on the transaction as valued at the time the deed was conveyed, and that appellant exceeded these statutory limitations. No authority, the court added, existed in the statute for imposing a tax based on anticipation. Tax laws were to be construed strongly in favor of a taxpayer, the court stated, noting that although the statute was silent as to when the tax became due, it apparently became due when the conveyance was completed and title passed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, automobile liability insurers and insured, sought review of an order from the trial court (Florida), entering a judgment for appellee estate administrator in a wrongful death suit. Appellants claimed that the Florida Wrongful Death Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 678.21(6)(a) (1975), did not allow nondependent children to recover net accumulations. Appellee argued that the act intended to provide damages to adult lineal descendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured was a driving a car in which the passenger was killed. Appellee estate administrator's brought a wrongful death suit against appellant automobile liability insurers and the driver. Appellee sought net accumulations damages under the Florida Wrongful Death Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 768.21(6)(a) (1975). A jury awarded such damages, along with medical and funeral expenses. Appellants sought review, claiming the Act did not allow nondependent adult children to collect net accumulations damages. Appellee argued that had the legislature intended to limit the recovery of net accumulations to minor children, it would have used those terms rather than the words &quot;lineal descendants.&quot; Thus, appellee argued, decedent's children were entitled to such damages as lineal descendants. The reviewing court reversed and remanded, holding that because the statute's intent was to provide such damages only to dependent children, decedent's adult children were precluded from recovering on this basis. Such a finding was constitutional because the legislature had the right to set the standards of recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court reversed and remanded the trial court's entry of a judgment for appellee estate administrator in his wrongful death action against appellant automobile liability insurers and appellant insured. Because a wrongful death statute limited the recovery of net accumulations damages to those children dependent upon a decedent, and because decedent's survivors were not dependent upon decedent, no net accumulations were due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shot and killed a woman and then had intercourse with her body. Because appellant was psychotic, he was found not guilty of first degree murder by reason of insanity and committed to a hospital. After 14 years of confinement, appellant petitioned the trial court for release. The trial court denied appellant's petition because it was not enough for appellant to prove that he was not likely to engage in further violence. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded for a hearing. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394.467(1)(a), the trial court had to determine whether appellant, if released, would injure himself or others. It was unclear whether the trial judge used this standard in evaluating appellant's petition. Based on the evidence, the court found that appellant would not likely injure himself or others. Appellant's psychosis was in remission, and his parents testified that they would monitor him.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, mother of deceased, argued appellant was not deceased's son and she was entitled to recover as the next person in line to inherit from deceased. Appellant alleged a variety of errors at trial including failure to admit a sister state's birth certificate which named deceased as his father and the allowance of appellee's testimony that her deceased son never told her he was the father of appellant. The court reversed and remanded, concluding the evidence presented made a close case and it was unable to say appellee's testimony was harmless error. The court determined the refusal to admit the sister state birth certificate was proper because the certificate was not authenticated. In order to properly authenticate a non-judicial public record of a sister state, the document had to be certified, sealed, and either a judge or state officer was required to vouch for the authority and incumbency of the record keeper and the genuineness of his signature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was charged with delinquency because he violated a local curfew ordinance, Pensacola, Fla., Code &sect; 122.14.

The court found that restraining children under the age of sixteen years from freely walking upon the streets or other public places when no emergency existed was incompatible with the freedoms of speech, association, peaceful assembly, and religion secured to all citizens of the state by Fla. Const. art. I. Because the ordinance did not mention an emergency situation, the court held that the ordinance constituted an invasion of personal rights and liberties and for that reason was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fishermen brought an action against appellee Department of Natural Resources attacking the constitutionality of 102 local acts or special acts of the legislature, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The challenged acts were local acts which purported to regulate the type, size, and use of fishing nets and to regulate certain fishing areas. The primary thrust of appellants' attack was that such local acts constituted an unreasonable interference with interstate commerce and that they were an unconstitutional exercise of police power. The trial court, noting that acts of the legislature were presumed constitutional, held that appellants had failed to meet their burden of proving the acts to be unconstitutional. The appeals court affirmed, holding that appellants failed to meet their burden of proof. The burden was upon plaintiffs to establish the invalidity of each act separately. The court did not construe the final judgment to be a holding that the subject acts were constitutional and that the final judgment was res judicata to any further attack upon their validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents filed, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.44, a statutorily mandated request for medical mediation in accordance with their allegation that appellee hospital's and appellee doctor's negligence at the time their child was born resulted in permanent injury. When the mediation panel met to consider the cause, appellants refused to offer any evidence before the panel. Appellants asserted that a full hearing would be wasteful, because they intended to file an action in a state court regardless of the outcome of the mediation proceedings. The panel found that appellees were not actionably negligent. The court below dismissed a subsequent medical malpractice action filed by appellants against appellees because it found that appellants' failure to offer any evidence at the mediation proceeding constituted non-performance of a condition precedent to the right to sue. The lower court's judgment was reversed and remanded based on the court's determination that under Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indigent petitioners filed a motion to compel respondent, the department of health and rehabilitative services, to furnish a copy of a transcript of proceedings before respondent to petitioners' counsel and to file the original with the court, at no cost to petitioners. The court denied the motion. The court did not have the statutory authority to order respondent to furnish a transcript at its own expense. Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57(1)(b)(6) (statute) required an agency to make a transcript available at no more than actual cost, with no exception for an indigent. The statute as applied to indigents was constitutional because it bore a rational relationship to the purpose of offsetting agency expenses. Fla. Const. Art. I, &sect; 21, regarding open access to courts, was never intended to create new causes of action. Section 21 only applied if access to the courts for redress of a particular injury was provided by statutory law predating the adoption of the Declaration of Rights in the Florida Constitution or where such right became a part of the common law of the state pursuant to Fla.
