<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance reduced from four-fifths to three-fifths the majority necessary for the county board of commissioners to override a veto by the board president.

The trial court ruled that the passage of the ordinance affected an alteration in the form of government under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(f)(1970) without referendum approval. To determine the meaning of &quot;form of government&quot; as used in &sect; 6(f), the court examined the debates and proceedings in the drafting of the 1970 constitution. The court found that form of government included the relative powers of the board president and the county board. Reducing the votes needed to override the board president's veto did effect a diminution of his power. Because the change to the county's form of government had not been approved by referendum as required by &sect; 6(f), the ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire occurred at defendant's place of business. A fireman was injured fighting the fire. Defendant was convicted of aggravated arson, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 20(a)(3) (1981). Defendant's conviction was reversed on appeal and the state sought review. The court held that to constitute a legitimate exercise of the police power, a legislative enactment had to bear a reasonable relationship to the public interest intended to be protected, and the means adopted had to be a reasonable method of accomplishing the desired objective. The court found that the purpose of para. 20(a)(3) was to subject arsonists to a more severe penalty when their conduct resulted in personal injury to firemen or policemen than when it resulted in property damage only. The court ruled that because aggravated arson did not require an unlawful purpose in setting a fire the statute swept too broadly by punishing innocent as well as culpable conduct in setting fires. The court found that para. 20(a)(3) violated the guarantee of due process in Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and affirmed the judgment of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with various violations of the Illinois Vehicle Code (Code) after a search of the premises revealed the presence of several stolen motor vehicles. Defendants sought to suppress the evidence seized during the search. The circuit court granted defendants' motion, holding that the search was conducted without probable cause and without a warrant, there was no valid consent, and &sect; 5-401(e) of the Code was unconstitutional. The appellate court vacated and on remand the circuit court again found &sect; 5-401(e) unconstitutional. The state appealed directly to the supreme court. The supreme court affirmed the circuit court. The court found that the administrative search authorized by &sect; 5-401(e) was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. However, the court found that &sect; 5-401(e) vested the state officials with too much discretion and did not provide for the regularity and neutrality required by the Fourth Amendment. The court held that good faith reliance on &sect; 5-401(e) did not cure the illegal search because the statute was procedural. The circuit court's determination that there was no valid consent was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which granted defendant wife's motion to dismiss one count in the husband's petition for dissolution of marriage which was filed under &sect; 401(a)(2) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 401(a)(2) (1984 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed count II of the husband's petition for dissolution of marriage on the grounds that the no-fault provision for dissolutions found in &sect; 401(a)(2) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 401(a)(2) (1984 Supp.), was unconstitutional as applied in the instant case. The court reversed, holding the no-fault provision to be a valid enactment because 1) there was no violation of the ex post facto clauses in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1970); and the impairment-of-contract clauses in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1970) were inapplicable. The court also held that the no-fault provision did not violate the due process clause at Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, because of the legislature's intent for the no-fault provision to apply to separation periods occurring prior to the statute's enactment, as in this case, and the state interest in providing a method for no-fault dissolutions while preserving the possibility of reconciliation, via the two-year separation period requirement of the no-fault provision, outweighed the wife's private interest in staying married.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 148/81-84 (1983), in an action alleging that the bank breached its fiduciary duty to land-trust beneficiary and his wife by purchasing the trust property for its own benefit at a public sale after the beneficiaries defaulted on their loan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that (1) the retroactivity provision of ch. 148/81-84 did not unconstitutionally impair beneficiary's contract rights under the United States Constitution, (2) the retroactivity provision is valid under the Illinois Constitution, (3) because the retroactivity provision did not unconstitutionally impair beneficiary's contract rights, the provision did not deprive him of property without due process of law under either the United States Constitution or the Illinois Constitution. The court found that because the dispute between beneficiary and the bank was pending in the trial court at the time ch. 148/81-84 became effective, that dispute had yet to be decided, and therefore, applying ch. 148/81-84 did not invade the province of the judiciary or violate the principle of separation of powers established by the Illinois Constitution. The court further found that application of ch. 148/81-84 was a reasonable exercise of the legislature's authority to provide for the public welfare and to safeguard the interests of the people, and such application furthered a broad societal interest.</SPAN></P>

At a bifurcated sentencing hearing, the jury found the existence of a statutory aggravating factor under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b)(2)) (1979), but found no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death penalty. His sentence was stayed pending a direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a group attack, the victim received four wounds, one of which was fatal. Defendant argued that the jury could have found he did not cause the fatal wound, that aggravated battery was a lesser-included offense of murder, and that he was constitutionally entitled to an instruction on the lesser offense. On appeal, the court held that the jury could not have rationally found defendant guilty of aggravated battery. The State presented alternative theories to establish defendant's guilt: direct responsibility or accountability. Defendant was either directly responsible for the victim's death based upon defendant's statement and a doctor's statement that defendant's knife was most likely to have caused the fatal wound, or legally accountable, even if defendant's actions were spontaneous and unplanned. The State established the elements necessary for finding defendant accountable for the actions of the other inmates who took part in the attack. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied his motion to reassign his request for post-conviction relief and which dismissed his request for post-conviction relief. Petitioner and a co-defendant were convicted in separate trials for the murders of three men and for armed violence and unlawful restraint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted, and he subsequently filed a request for post-conviction relief. Because the same judge that presided over his trial was the presiding judge on the post-conviction matter, petitioner filed a motion to reassign the post-conviction matter to a different judge, which was denied. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The matter should have been reassigned under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122-8 (Supp. 1984) even though the statute was not effective until after the post-conviction petition was filed. The statute changed a procedural law, and was therefore applicable to the pending action and to petitioner's motion filed after the state was enacted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Compensation Review Board was created by the Act to recommend compensation for members of the General Assembly, judges, constitutional officers, and certain appointed officers of the state. The Board submitted an initial report of recommendations to the General Assembly. The report was disapproved. The Board submitted an amended report, which was not disapproved by a majority of both houses of the General Assembly, so funds were appropriated for the salary increases recommended. Appellants filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act violated the state constitution and enjoining appellees from expending public funds pursuant to the Act. The circuit court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Act was enacted through the law-making process and in the normal legislative manner, satisfying the constitutional directive that salaries be provided or established by law. The Act itself and the appropriations bill were passed the General Assembly and presented to the Governor for possible veto. Thus, the requirements of article IV, section 8(c), and article IV, sections 9(a) and (b) were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

The newspaper sought review when the appellate court reversed the order of the circuit court that had held that the presses and equipment had qualified for the exemption. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court. The court found the legislative background of the manufacturing-machinery exemption indicated that printing presses were not intended to be included in the exemption. Newspaper publishers differed from other manufacturers because the legislature had made their product, newsprint, not subject to the retailers' occupation tax and use tax, so that they enjoyed a benefit that other manufacturers have not been given. Finally, the court found a rational relationship between the scope of the manufacturing-machinery exemption and the purpose for which it was enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a comment alluding to the fact that he would be eligible for parole if sentenced to life in prison was a reversible error because the information could have angered the jury to the point of influencing their consideration of the imposition the death penalty. He also argued that it was an error for the prosecution to argue that discontinuing capital punishment caused a sharp increase in the number of homicides in the country. The court determined that by injecting the parole consideration into the penalty determination, the jury's attention was diverted from the offense and the offender and was focused upon a speculative possibility that might or might not occur. The court held that the possibility of a parole was immaterial to the aggravating and mitigating issues of a capital sentencing hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court explained that the Service Use Tax Act taxes the privilege of using in Illinois real or tangible personal property acquired as an incident to the purchase of a service from a serviceman. 120 Ill.

While the taxpayer acknowledged that its catalogs are tangible personal property acquired incident to the purchase of services, it maintained that the temporary storage exception to the act precluded taxation of the material sent out of state and that a contrary result would unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce. The taxpayer maintained, and the appellate court held, that the exception applied because the catalogs were merely labeled in Illinois before continuing their interstate journey. The state argued that the catalogs were used in Illinois before their return to the stream of commerce. The court affirmed, finding that the exception for property which, after being brought into the state and stored here temporarily, was physically attached to other property (the mailing labels) and used solely outside the state covered the taxpayer's activities.</SPAN></P>

The landowner's petition for leave to appeal was granted. The appellate court determined that the circuit court had no jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned real estate. The land was submerged by a lake as a result of the state's building of causeways across the lake. The lake was later drained and immediately refilled and restocked with fish. Upon the state's refusal to purchase the property, the landowner instituted a proceeding for mandamus to make the director of the department institute eminent domain proceedings in order to determine just compensation. The court found that there was a physical invasion and taking of the property. Therefore, as guaranteed by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 (1970), the landowner was entitled to a determination of its damages. The failure of the director to institute such proceedings violated the Illinois Constitution. As such, the landowner's action was not an action against the state, but was, rather, against the unconstitutional conduct of a state official. Therefore, the issuance of a writ of mandamus, which would compel the director to institute eminent domain proceedings, was proper. The circuit court had the jurisdiction to issue such writ.</SPAN></P>

The court found that such an assignment of error was without merit where defendant failed to establish that he was substantially prejudiced by his counsel's alleged ineffectiveness. The court similarly found no impermissible prejudice from the alleged improper comment from opposing counsel or the alleged improper admission of testimony that defendant had committed adultery. The court further found that the trial judge's refusal to grant a mistrial or to excuse veniremen who overheard a juror state her personal opinion of defendant was proper where there was no evidence that the single, isolated comment impacted the jury's ability to reach a verdict based solely upon the evidence.

Defendants were sentenced to death, and the trial court imposed concurrent 60-year prison sentences for the armed robbery and aggravated kidnapping convictions. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, along with several others, were involved in the murder of three individuals. Defendants claimed there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find them guilty of the murders beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution's chief witness' testimony was unreliable. They also contended that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence that caused them prejudice and deprived them of a fair trial. Defendants also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. The court held that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict; (2) photos obtained from a garbage bag outside one defendant's apartment were properly admitted because the search of the garbage bag was constitutionally permissible; (3) evidence that certain witnesses were in protective custody or relocated was not prejudicial and did not deprive defendants of a fair trial; (4) there was no abuse of discretion in allowing certain methods of cross-examination and prosecutorial remarks that did not constitute reversible errors; and (5) defendants failed to establish that their convictions would have turned out differently but for the alleged errors of their counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentences entered against defendants for murder and armed robbery were affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff broker filed an action against defendant director of the Department of Registration and Education, alleging that plaintiff's marketing plans were not violative of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 5732(e)(20) (1981) of the Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen License Act. Plaintiff also claimed the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court found that plaintiff's marketing plans were prohibited by the statute, but the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the due process clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Upon appeal by both parties, the court affirmed. The court found that both of plaintiff's marketing plans were prohibited by the statute because they both offered incentives to induce buyers or sellers to enter into real estate transactions. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because the state failed to establish that its interest in protecting consumers was directly advanced by the statute. The court noted that a more limited speech regulation that specifically prohibited the use of deceptive or misleading offerings as inducements would have been an appropriate limitation on commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed directly the finding of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 19(1)(b) (1981) was unconstitutional. Defendant appealed to the appellate court his convictions for burglary and possession of burglary tools and his sentence for the latter, which was to be served consecutively with sentences in unrelated cases. The court granted defendant's motion to transfer his appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a person could properly be convicted of burglary under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 19(1)(a) (1981) when, without authority, he knowingly entered a motor vehicle with the intent to steal the vehicle itself. Since defendant did not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence establishing his unlawful entry and his intent to steal the entire vehicle, the court affirmed the burglary conviction. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 19(1)(b) (1981), under which the sentence for theft from a vehicle could possibly be greater than would be imposed if the whole vehicle and its contents were stolen, did not violate Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 11. The court affirmed the imposition of the consecutive sentence for possession of burglary tools, believing that the trial court complied with &sect; 5(8)(4)(b) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005(8)(4)(b) (1981), which prohibited imposition of a consecutive sentence unless a court believed that such a term was required to protect the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant, the basis for which the court was to set forth in the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the circuit court was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The cause was remanded to the circuit court for sentencing on defendant's burglary conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought a paternity suit claiming the father was the father of her child born out of wedlock. The father sought to dismiss the complaint because the action was not brought within two years of the birth of the child. While the case was pending, the two-year limitation period was determined to be unconstitutional. The circuit court ruled that although the two-year limitation was unconstitutional, the balance of the Act was valid and denied the father's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. It found that the objective of the Act was to provide for the paternal support, maintenance, and education of children born of unwed parents, thereby converting a father's moral obligation of support into a legal one, and preventing such children from becoming public charges. As the balance of the Act met its legislative objectives and policy considerations indicated that the legislature intended the Act to remain a valid statute, even with the limitation period excised, the court found the balance of the Act was constitutional and remanded the matter for trial.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to death, and he appealed. The court affirmed. In his appeal, defendant raised several arguments. Several of his arguments focused on the search warrant affidavits. Defendant contended that factual misstatements were intentionally inserted into the affidavits to deceive the magistrate and therefore the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrants should have been suppressed under Franks. The statements contained within a search warrant affidavit were presumed valid. To overcome the presumption of validity, appellant was required to make a substantial preliminary showing that false statements were deliberately included in the affidavit, or included with a reckless disregard for the truth, and that the statements were necessary to a finding of probable cause. If these conditions were met, appellant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. Defendant was provided this hearing; however, he failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a deliberate falsehood and to show, even if the misstatements were omitted, that probable cause was lacking.</SPAN></P>

Defendant offered to plead guilty for a sentence of natural life. The state consulted with the victim's family and rejected the offer when they insisted on the death penalty. The state conceded the family's wishes were a factor in rejecting the offer. Defendant contended the consultation was a constitutionally impermissible abuse of prosecutorial discretion and that it made the death penalty arbitrary and freakish. The court held that the state was not barred from consulting the victim's family in a capital case. Defendant also challenged the excusal for cause of prospective jurors who were against the death panel, the racial makeup of the jury, and claimed that the statute unconstitutionally vested the jury with unlimited discretion to determine nonstatutory aggravating factors and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, who failed to show the shooting was accidental. The court rejected these arguments, affirmed the conviction and sentence for intentionally killing the guard, vacated the other two murder convictions, and set an execution date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city instituted a municipal utility tax pursuant to the Public Utilities Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 36(a). The telephone company billed the city for certain tax-related charges. The city filed suit to enjoin the telephone company from billing the city for the charges and for the recovery of such sums that the telephone company previously collected from the city. The city prevailed at the trial level, but the judgment was reversed in the lower appellate court. The city appealed further. The court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court and affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. The court held that the only &quot;customer&quot; not subject to the additional charge authorized by para. 36(a) was the taxing municipality. A common sense construction of para. 36(a) precluded the requirement that the taxing municipality pay the tax and thereafter pay a service charge to the utility for having received the tax money and then refunding it. Elimination of the billing of the additional charge to the city presented no burdensome accounting problems because para. 36(a) provided that the additional charge was to be shown separately on each customer's utility bill.</SPAN></P>

Therefore the court held that the prosecutor did not violate his constitutional duty to provide the defendant with exculpatory material. Moreover, the court held that defendant's argument that his attorney was unable to properly represent him because of his background, philosophies, attitudes, and alleged lack of experience was without merit. The court also held that defense counsel's strategy during the sentencing phase not to present possible mitigating factors did not demonstrate incompetence. And finally, the court concluded that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated by the Illinois Death Penalty Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9 - 1 et. seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants appealed decisions of the Appellate Court for the Third District (Illinois) and the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), arguing that involuntary manslaughter could not serve as a predicate felony to support their armed-violence convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and armed violence. Since both charges were based on the same act, the trial court entered judgment only on the greater offense, armed violence. The second defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and armed violence based on involuntary manslaughter. His involuntary-manslaughter conviction was vacated, and he was sentenced on the armed-violence conviction. Each challenged the use of involuntary manslaughter as a predicate felony for armed violence under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A-2 (1981). The court held that involuntary manslaughter, just as voluntary manslaughter, could not be enhanced to a Class X felony under the armed-violence statute. This was so because the legislature did not intend the Class X consequences of armed violence to apply to a nondeliberate act. Involuntary manslaughter involved no intent that could be deterred by enhanced punishment for use of a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's case was on direct appeal from the Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois) because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1404 (1975), which was the basis for his conviction of the delivery of a substance represented to be a controlled substance was ruled unconstitutional. Defendant challenged the trial court's finding that a part of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-4.1 (1977) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding para. 115-4.1 unconstitutional because it did not violate the separation of powers clause in the Illinois Constitution of 1970. The part of the statute that was ruled unconstitutional provided that the trial court was required to wait two days before proceeding with defendant's trial in his absence. In reviewing the statute, the court determined that to dictate how long a trial judge was required to wait before proceeding with a trial, when a defendant had willfully absented himself from his trial once it commenced, unconstitutionally infringed upon the trial judge's authority to control his docket. The court concluded that the statute was permissive rather than mandatory and thus, was not unconstitutional. Because the statute was permissive, whether to proceed with the trial was within the trial judge's discretion. The court determined that the trial judge did not violate the statute when he refused to wait two days before proceeding with defendant's trial in his absence. Defendant waived his right to be present at trial because he voluntarily absented himself from the trial.</SPAN></P>

XIV, Ill. Const. art I, &sect; 2. The court held that: (1) the Act was a reasonable exercise of police power; (2) the different standard of care for tort liability in snowmobile accidents was justified due to the inherent danger of snowmobile operation; and (3) the Act did not deprive the snowmobiler of a remedy but merely restricted the liability of landowners who would otherwise have to undertake massive repairs to make their property safe for snowmobiling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Director of Public Health (DPH), the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and a water company, appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois). The DPH and the EPA were enjoined from enforcing a fluoridation statute. The company was enjoined from fluoridating its water supply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee's complaint alleged that fluoride in public drinking water was dangerous to health and that its use did not prevent tooth decay. The circuit court held that &sect; 7a of &quot;An Act to provide for safeguarding the public health by vesting certain measures of control and supervision in the Department of Public Health over public water supplies in the state,&quot; Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 121g1 (1981), was unconstitutional. Defendants contended that the statute providing for mandatory fluoridation of the public water supply was a reasonable exercise of the police power. They argued that the statute's enforcement might not be enjoined merely on the showing that it was debatable whether requiring fluoridation was a valid public health measure. The committee argued that the rights to life and health were placed in jeopardy without due process of law, and the validity of the statute could be upheld only if a compelling state interest was shown that required it. On appeal, the court found that the committee did not sustain its burden of showing that the fluoridation statute was so unreasonable as to be invalid.

The court retained jurisdiction to enter an order after judgment had been entered on the separate murder convictions. In a footnote, the court stated that the separate convictions had been affirmed; thus, it affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained from the defendant's car located 800 miles away from the crime scene and 19 days after the murder was properly denied because the affidavit for the warrant contained sufficient specificity under all of the circumstances. Further, the record established that defendant's housemate consented to the search of his bedroom. The court held that the prosecution's exclusion of veniremen from the jury because they had fixed opposition to capital punishment was proper and that the failure to preserve an issue for appellate review was not ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conducted a separate sentencing hearing to determine whether a sentence of death should be imposed, and defendant was subsequently sentenced to death. The trial court stayed imposition of the sentence pending direct appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence presented was insufficient to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and challenged the sufficiency of the State's evidence that his motive was to obtain an inheritance. The court ruled that the State was permitted to introduce evidence of defendant's financial problems. The court held that the matters which defendant contended were improperly admitted did not constitute evidence that defendant committed other crimes. The court also determined that the State's closing argument was not improper and the State did not misstate the evidence. Because none of the points relied upon by defendant constituted error, there was no possibility for cumulative error. The court determined that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. The court ruled that defendant's two statutory arguments provided no basis for reversing his conviction or, alternatively, vacating the death sentence. Finally, the court held that there was no basis for vacating defendant's sentence on the grounds that it was imposed in violation of the Eighth Amendment ban against cruel and unusual punishment or on grounds that the state acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village ordinance completely banned the possession of handguns, with exceptions for security guards, law enforcement, and inoperable weapons. On appeal, the court analyzed the ordinance under the Illinois constitution. The court found that the ordinance was valid under the home rule statutes of Illinois because the village's interest did not implicate a state concern. Further, under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, the court analyzed the &quot;right to bear arms&quot; provision of the state constitution and determined that it was the framers' intent that some classifications of firearms could be banned altogether, just not firearms as a whole. Finally, the court entertained the notion that the ordinance violated police powers. However, the court determined that the ordinance did not infringe upon a fundamental right and thus passed muster under a &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The court concluded that there was a rational basis, safety, for the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, in three consolidated cases, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held para. 702--7(6) of the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 701--1 et seq. (1983), unconstitutional. The paragraph provided that minors who were at least 15 at the time of one of the following offenses were to be charged as adults: murder, rape, deviate sexual assault and armed robbery with a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In arguing that the trial court erred in holding para. 702--7(6) of the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 701--1 et. seq. (1983), unconstitutional, the state claimed that in setting apart for adult prosecution specific offenders (those 15 and older) and offenses (rape, murder, deviate sexual assault, and armed robbery with a firearm), the legislature drew a rational distinction within its authority which did not violate either equal protection or due process. Defendants, on the other hand, claimed that the distinction was arbitrary and discriminatory and thus violated both procedural and substantive due process and equal protection. The court noted that the legislature created the juvenile court system and that it was within its power to establish statutory classifications as long as they bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. The court found that the limited nature of the exception to juvenile court jurisdiction was rationally based, both on the age of the offender and on the threat which the particular offense posed on the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments that held unconstitutional a provision of the Juvenile Court Act that provided that individuals who were 15 or older at the time of commission of specific offenses be treated as adults. Accordingly, the dismissal of the accusatory instrument against each defendant was reversed, and the cases were remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the library district was entitled to retroactive relief in the form of a refund of the interest that the county had earned on taxes collected from the district. The court's previous ruling, on the first appeal of the case, was that the statute upon which the county relied to retain the interest was unconstitutional. It remanded the case to the circuit court, which held that the district was not entitled to retroactive relief. The appellate court reversed. The court reversed the appellate court, affirming the circuit court's judgment. The court held that retroactive relief was not appropriate because the county had reasonably relied upon existing law for its authority to retain the interest, and the new principle of law established in the first appeal had not been clearly foreshadowed. The court further held that the purpose of its earlier decision would be best served if it did not impose a burden that pre-dated its finding that the statute was unconstitutional. Lastly, it would be inequitable to impose a retrospective burden on the county. Thus, the court held that interest should be awarded prospectively from the date of the first appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) granted a temporary injunction enjoining appellant tax authorities from transferring money from a protest fund. However, before a hearing on the merits was held, the Messages Tax Act (MTA), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 467.1 et seq. (1981), was amended. Thus, the trial court granted summary judgment in appellee taxpayer's favor, and the authorities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its protest action, the taxpayer sought a judicial determination of whether the MTA authorized the use of combined apportionment, a computation that reduced the taxpayer's apportionment factor and accordingly reduced its invested-capital tax liability. The amendment, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 467.1 (1982), prohibited the use of combined apportionment for purposes of the MTA. The trial court concluded that, insofar as the amendment retroactively prohibited combined apportionment, it violated the due process principles of the federal and state constitutions. On appeal, the court upheld the validity of the amendment and reversed the summary judgment granted to the taxpayer. The court held that the taxpayer had no vested right in the continuance of a taxing statute and that the retroactive tax measure did not violate the taxpayer's due process rights. The court considered the nature of the measure and the circumstances leading to its adoption. That court found that the taxpayer did not change its position in reasonable reliance on the prior law and that the taxpayer should have foreseen the possibility that its proposed use of combined apportionment would have been disapproved.</SPAN></P>

Three assessments occurred without discovery of the error. The error was first discovered when the landowner appealed the proposed valuations on all the parcels that it owned. The county treasurer then began administrative back tax proceedings against the landowner. The landowner filed a complaint to restrain the further assessment and collection of additional taxes. The trial court found in favor of the county treasurer and the landowner appealed. The appellate court reversed, and the county treasurer appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that if property was not assessed at all, it could be assessed in later years as omitted property, but where an assessment had been made too low due to clerical error, it could not be reassessed in subsequent years as having been omitted. The court determined that the parcel was under assessed so, pursuant to Illinois law (Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of the judgments from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), which found appellant was in contempt of court for his failure to pay a maintenance obligation in a dissolution-of-marriage case and that denied appellant's motion to reconsider. The issue raised was whether Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, para. 12 -- 1001 constituted a defense to the contempt order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To enforce the maintenance provision of a dissolution-of-marriage judgment, appellee wife initiated contempt proceedings against appellant husband. Following the orders that found appellant was in contempt of court, appellant challenged the decisions, contending that Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, para. 12 -- 1001 constituted a valid defense to the contempt order and that the trial court abused its discretion. The orders were affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the trial court neither abused its discretion nor reached a decision contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence when it rejected appellant's defense of inability to pay. Additionally, the court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, para. 12 -- 1001 was not so vague as to violate the constitutional principals of due process. The court also found that Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, para. 12 -- 1001 was not a defense to the contempt order. Further, it was determined that on remand the contempt order had to be revised to correct the problem that neither order provided for appellant's release from jail if he paid the arrearage after he was incarcerated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders that found appellant husband in contempt for his failure to pay a maintenance obligation to appellee wife and that denied appellant's motion to reconsider were affirmed in part because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected appellant's defense of inability to pay. Additionally, the court reversed in part because the personal property exemption statute was not so vague as to violate the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Appellate Court for the Fourth District (Illinois), which affirmed defendant's sentence for aggravated battery consecutive to a prior misdemeanor sentence under the provisions of &sect; 5-8-4(d) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(d) (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery, a felony. The trial court sentenced defendant to a 3-year term for the aggravated battery, to be served consecutively to a 10-month term that he was already serving for a prior, unrelated misdemeanor. In affirming defendant's sentence, the appellate court held that para. 1005-8-4(d) did not require merger of the felony and misdemeanor sentences. The court granted defendant's petition for leave to appeal from the appellate court's order, and reversed the judgment of the appellate court. Under the plain language of para. 1005-8-4(d), defendant's misdemeanor sentence was required to be merged in and run concurrently with the felony sentence. The court interpreted the term &quot;shall&quot; as mandatory rather than directory. Para. 1005-8-4(e) was irrelevant to defendant's case, as it concerned multiple sentences imposed at the same time for related crimes. The court found that para. 1005-8-4(d) was a mandatory limitation on the trial court's discretion in para. 1005-8-4(a), which generally allowed concurrent or consecutive sentences to be imposed by the trial court. Finally, defendant's failure to object in the trial court did not waive the error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court insofar as it affirmed the sentence imposed by the trial court. The court vacated the sentence imposed by the trial court and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to resentence defendant for the offense of aggravated battery in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

He moved to dismiss the information, and the circuit court declared the criminal defamation statute unconstitutional and dismissed the charges. The state contended that the statute was constitutional. The defendant maintained that the criminal defamation statute was overly broad. The court reversed the decision because (1) the circuit court did not make an explicit finding that the statute was too broad; rather, it ruled the statute unconstitutional on the basis of the qualified-truth defense, (2) the statute was not overly broad, as it applied only to those words which by their very utterance tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace, and (3) truth was not an absolute defense in a prosecution for criminal defamation of a private person.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order upholding the order suppressing the cocaine evidence. The court held that the search was part of a lawful inventory search. Probable cause existed for defendant's arrest and detention, and the police properly listed defendant's personal belongings so as to avoid false claims regarding the property when defendant was released. There was no less intrusive way to conduct the inventory. Further, the search of defendant's wallet and its contents were proper subjects of a search incident to a lawful arrest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed directly from the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois) that imposed the death penalty upon a jury conviction of intentional murder, Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness testified that she found her pajama-clad son dead just inside the door to their house and that defendant then kidnapped her, shot her, and left her for dead. Defendant was convicted of intentional murder, Ill. Rev.

The jury that had entered defendant's convictions sentenced him to death on the felony-murder counts, to 60 years' imprisonment on the intentional-murder count, and to 40 years' imprisonment for armed violence and home invasion upon its findings of the existence of statutory aggravating factors and no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death sentence, paras. 9(1)(b), (c). Defendant appealed from his convictions and sentences directly from the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed only one of defendant's murder convictions by agreement of the parties, reversed the other murder convictions, vacated all of the sentences on its findings of prejudicial error and failure to consider statutory mitigating factors, and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of felony murder based on armed robbery, of armed violence, and of home invasion but reversed three other murder convictions by agreement of the parties, as there was only one murder victim. Defendant's sentences, including the death penalty, were vacated and remanded for resentencing because the court found prejudicial error in the conduct of the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss an amended complaint charging him with the offense of operating a motorcycle on one wheel in violation of &sect; 11-1403.2 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-1403.2 (1981). Defendant's motion was based on his claim that para. 11-1403.2 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In holding para. 11-1403.2 unconstitutional, the trial court found that it mandated a conviction for reckless driving for conduct that might not otherwise constitute that offense. On appeal from that decision, the court disagreed and reversed. Paragraph 11-1403.2 created an absolute liability and its validity had to be determined in light of the authorities relevant to that type of legislation. To constitute a legitimate exercise of the police power, a legislative enactment had to be reasonably related to the public interest intended to be protected and the means adopted had to be reasonable in light of the desired objective. The court held that the Illinois Legislature could have reasonably found that one-wheel motorcycle driving was dangerous and that strict punishment of drivers who operated motorcycles on one wheel was necessary for protection of the public interest. Thus, there was no basis for striking the statute as unreasonable or arbitrary in its classifications. Further, para. 11-1403.2 was not special legislation, nor was it an express amendment to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-503. Thus, it was not unconstitutional for failing to fully set forth para. 11-503.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A boys mother reported her son missing to the police. About the time the boy was missing defendant's truck was seen near the last know location of the boy. The police found out the defendant had a history of sexually assaulting young men. They sought several search warrants for defendant's home. During the course of the investigation defendant confessed to having killed 30 people. He was tried and convicted of 33 counts of murder among others charges. Defendant challenged his conviction on several grounds. The court affirmed and found that the search warrants sufficiently set out the items sought at the location and, therefore, defendant's motion to suppress the resulting evidence was properly denied. The confession was shown to be the product of free rational mind. The attorney's advice to confess given the fact that the police were on the verge of locating 27 bodies in the crawl space of defendant's home was not ineffective assistance of counsel. The court's questing of the jury was sufficient and in most instances the defense counsel had declined the opportunity to ask further questions of the jury and when they did request further questions the court complied with the request.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 127, paras. 170-172a (1977), seeking Illinois income tax refunds for disputed taxes under protest. The Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) upheld the bank's position regarding apportionment, but ruled in favor of defendant state regarding amortization of bonds interest, and both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>

In reversing an order upholding the state's position, the court found that the bank was entitled to amortize the premiums that it had paid to acquire state, county, and municipal securities. In affirming the ruling overturning the state's apportionment formula, the court found that interest on obligations of the United States could not be used in any way in determining tax liability, as such interest was exempt from all taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that the bank was entitled to a tax credit for the amortized portion of premiums paid to acquire bonds, and reversed the ruling that the state could take interest on obligations of the United States into account in a formula for apportioning taxes.

The mother filed a motion to dismiss the state's petition on the ground that Ill. Rev.

The state appealed the judgment of the trial court, and the court, in light of the section's amendment, vacated the judgment and held that the question of the statute's validity was moot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax collector filed complaints against the pollution control facilities based on tax assessments.

Stat. ch. 120, para. 502a(3) (1981) was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the appellate court affirmed. The appeals were consolidated. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments. Section 21a(3) was a method of valuation and did not provide an impermissible reduction in valuation resulting in an invalid exemption. It was recognition from the legislature that the pollution control facilities were not necessarily economically productive and should be valued at their productive earning capacity. Section 21a(3) did not violate Ill. Const. art IX, &sect; 4(b) because the legislature had the power to classify property for tax purposes.

The circuit court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 8-2101, which rendered the documents privileged, violated the Equal Protection Clause and the prohibition against special legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hospital board contended that it was not required to produce the medical committee review documents because &sect; 8-2101 was not unconstitutional. The court agreed. The exception under &sect; 8-2101, which allowed a physician to gain access to review committee information only in the limited circumstance of a proceeding deciding staff privileges, was necessary in order to protect the due process rights of physicians. However, the court held that the issue in a due process challenge to revocation of staff privileges was not the same as the issue in a medical malpractice action. And, the statute was not one-sided because it provided for the discovery of patient's own records which were the source of her claim. Moreover, the classification of physicians and medical malpractice plaintiffs was rationally related to the state's interest of improving health care through confidential peer review. Accordingly, &sect; 8-2101 offended neither the Illinois nor Federal Equal Protection Clause. In addition, the court held that because the exemption represented an attempt to safeguard the physician's right to due process, the characterization of the legislation as &quot;special&quot; was also erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and held that the statutory privilege for medical committee review documents was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The lower court in Cook county declared the statute unconstitutional in its entirety and concluded in its memorandum opinion that the individuals who paid the transfer tax were entitled to the monies unlawfully retained. The court dismissed the action from Lake County as premature because the lower court in Lake County failed to make any express written finding that there was no just reason for delay, and reversed the judgment of the lower court in Cook County.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff beneficiaries appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted defendant bank's amended motion to dismiss the beneficiaries' class action complaint. The complaint alleged that the bank, which served as land trustee, had breached its fiduciary duty by purchasing the trust property for its own benefit at public sale and held the property in constructive trust for the beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the retroactivity provision of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 148, para. 81-84 (Supp. 1982) (Act) violated the separation of powers established by the Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 (1970) and the impairment of contracts prohibition of the U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 10 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1970) or the various provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The beneficiaries had entered into a land trust agreement with the bank, gave a collateral assignment of their beneficial interest as collateral, and the bank sold the property at allegedly below market price after they defaulted. The court found that the Act dictated that the rights and duties of the bank were unaffected by the fact that they served both as land trustee and secured creditor. The statute stated that it did not affect the trustee's duties, the bank's extension of credit was not a breach of duty, and there were no damages due. However, because the Act attempted to change the law retroactively, the court found that the statute violated the principle of separation of powers and was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that the retroactivity section of the Act was invalid and could not be applied to land trust agreements that existed on or before the effective date of the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court concerned the Prevailing Wage Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, paras. 39s --1 to 39s --12 (1981). Union representatives had filed objections to the prevailing wage that was determined by the county. The union representative filed suit and argued that the county had failed to follow the Act because it included wages paid on private construction projects in its calculation of the prevailing wage rate. The lower courts upheld the constitutionality of the statute at issue. The union representatives contended that the county had no standing to contest the constitutionality of a state statute under the due process clause. The court did not address this issue because it was not raised below. Contractors had intervened in the action and argued that the Act was arbitrary and irrational. The court did not address the arguments raised by the contractors because it believed the issues raised should have been addressed by the legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the people ex relator, the Director of the Illinois Department of Labor (director), sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Ogle County (Illinois), which, sua sponte, declared that the Prevailing Wage Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, paras. 39s-1 to 39s-12 (1981), was unconstitutional for requiring public bodies to pay workers on construction projects more than they would without the Act. The complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director filed a complaint against defendant employer to compel compliance with the Act. The director alleged that the employer was performing a public works construction project and that the employer was, therefore, required to pay the prevailing wage under the Act. The director sought a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and access to the employer's wage and hour records. The director appealed after the circuit court decided that the Act was unconstitutional and dismissed the complaint, on the ground that the Act violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2; U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the action because the Act was previously found constitutional under the minimum-rationality standard of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Act did not violate the Due Process Clause because the Act bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. That interest was to assure that people working on public works projects received decent wages so that the work would be completed without interruptions or delay by workmen of average skill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the director and reversed the circuit court's conclusion that the Act was unconstitutional. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, at which defendant was represented by counsel, his probation was revoked. The defendant was then sentenced to a term of 364 days with credit given for time served on probation. The sentence was to run concurrently with his other sentence. The court affirmed the lower court's affirmance of the revocation of probation but vacated the portion that remanded for a determination of sentence credit because defendant had already served his sentence. The court held that defendant's right to counsel was not violated. The court further held that when a defendant was placed on probation, he alone held the key to the prison gates during the probationary period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 13-year old boy, admitted to the stabbing murder of an employee at a local dry cleaner. The event received extensive media coverage, including dissemination of information regarding a polygraph test taken by defendant's accomplice. Defendant conducted a poll of registered voters, which revealed extensive knowledge of the case among county residents. As a result, defendant filed a motion to change venue that was denied by the trial court. Defendant was convicted and challenged the conviction alleging that the trial court erred. The appellate court agreed, and reversed defendant's conviction. Both parties appealed that decision, and the court affirmed as modified. The court held that on the totality of the record, defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial. In addition, the trial court's denial of defendant's challenges for cause was erroneous in that a prospective juror who was exposed to and remembered highly significant information, or other incriminating matters that were not admissible evidence, or inflammatory material was subject to challenge for cause and disqualification was automatic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous arguments on appeal including that he did not voluntarily waive his Fifth Amendment rights or his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and that admitting evidence of unrelated factors during the sentencing phase of the trial resulted in an arbitrary and capricious administration of the death penalty. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court found that defendant was familiar enough with the Miranda warnings to understand what a waiver meant. Because he knew the severity of the charges against him charges and that the charges included murder, the court found that defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel when he gave his statement without first asking for an attorney. The court found no error in admitting evidence that defendant had been convicted of a prior murder. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(c) (1979) allowed the court to consider any aggravating and any mitigating factors relative to the imposition of the death penalty. The court reasoned that both the State and defendant were allowed considerable leeway to present evidence as long as it was reliable.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1404(b) (Supp. 1982), was unconstitutional and granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge. Defendant filed a motion to strike certain portions of an appendix to the state's brief because it was not made part of the record in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful distribution of a look-alike substance. The trial court granted his motion to dismiss on the ground that &sect; 404(b) of the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court denied defendant's motion to strike a report from the state's brief because the report was a public record of which judicial notice could be taken. The court held that &sect; 404(b) did not violate due process because it discouraged illicit traffic in narcotics and was reasonably related to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Defendant did not succeed in demonstrating that &sect; 404(b) was impermissibly vague in all of its applications. Because the statute did not involve First Amendment freedoms, the vagueness challenge had to be examined in light of the facts of defendant's case. The charge against defendant alleged conduct to which the statute clearly applied. Defendant lacked standing to attack the sentencing provisions of the Act because there had been no adjudication of guilt and no sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary refused to approve and file the articles of amendment, contending that section 28(c) of the Business Corporation Act (statute), Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 32, para. 157.28(c), which allowed permissive alternatives to voting rights was invalid as violative of applicable constitutional section in that it failed to preserve the traditional cumulative voting rules for Illinois corporations that were in existence before the effective date of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. The court held that the applicable constitutional section guaranteed to all shareholders of corporations in existence prior to July 1, 1971, the right to vote cumulatively for corporate directors, notwithstanding the acquisition dates of such shares. However, such rights were able to be waived upon the unanimous approval of all shareholders entitled to vote at an election of directors. Thus, the statute was constitutional in that the elimination or limitation of such voting rights was conditioned upon such unanimous approval. Because the corporation satisfied this unanimity requirement, the Secretary erroneously refused to approve and file the articles of amendment tendered.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 102, para. 4.11 (1982) (law) made it unlawful to simultaneously hold the position of county board member and township assessor in the board member's county. The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) found that these positions were compatible and declared the law unconstitutional. The state sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state alleged that the trial court erred in holding that the offices of township assessor and county board member were compatible as a matter of common law and thereby also erred in holding that the law was unconstitutional. The court held that the common law rule of incompatibility focused on two offices held by the same person, where one of those offices was subordinate to the other in some important and principal duty and subject to the other's revisory power. The court found that a county board member had the authority to act on the appointment, salary, and budget of the supervisor of assessments. The court also found that county board members reviewed and were able to revise township assessments made by the township assessor. Because the township assessor's position was subordinate to the supervisor of assessments and because a county board member voted on who would be the supervisor of assessments, the court held that there was a possible conflict. Thus, the court reversed the lower court and held that the law was constitutional because the offices of township assessor and county board member were incompatible and the same person could not hold these positions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the police officers denied beating defendant and denied defendant ever went into the washroom. Since defendant's argument was rebutted, his contention of error was not properly preserved for review. Defendant also contended that an accountability instruction given to the jury erroneously stated the law.

The trial court appointed counsel to represent him on the direct appeal of the jury's death sentence. The court affirmed the conviction and, after considering the evidence, held that the death penalty was not unwarranted. Defendant's challenges to the constitutionality of the capital sentencing scheme were rejected, and it was held that the qualification of jurors did not result in a conviction-prone jury or deny defendant a jury from a fairly chosen cross section of the community. The evidence supported the jury's determination that the State had satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was sane when the offense was committed. The waiver of counsel at sentencing did not frustrate the policy of providing the sentencing body with all relevant mitigating evidence because the waiver was freely made and the jury was required to consider all mitigating evidence in the trial record.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected claims that the trial court, where an &quot;associate&quot; judge was presiding, lacked jurisdiction, that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a defense motion for a mental examination, and that defendant was entitled to actually receive the presentence report prior to the convening of the sentencing hearing. The court also found that defendant failed to meet his burden to show that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and rejected a claim that the trial court erred in finding that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude a death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and attempted murder after it was shown that all three victims were poisoned, and it was clear that defendant had the motive and opportunity to poison each. Additional evidence supported defendant's conviction as well, including the fact that defendant had recently purchased large amounts of arsenic and the fact that defendant's financial turmoil provided defendant with a dire situation, which he apparently solved by killing those from whom he would inherit property in the case of death. On appeal from defendant's convictions and death sentence, the court found no merit to defendant's claims of trial court error. Testimony not offered for the truth of the matter asserted was properly admitted as non-hearsay, and an expert was properly allowed to testify regarding his interpretation of complex financial documents, which showed defendant's financial turmoil. The court also found that jury confusion over information contained in a jury handbook did not warrant a new trial, and the comments made by the prosecutor during closing were proper.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the class's motion for summary judgment, ordered a trustee to prepare a plan to pay the refund to the class, and stayed judgment pending the clerk's appeal. The court affirmed the order because it found that: (1) a tax may be imposed on litigants when it is collected for court related purposes, (2) the fee was an improper tax on litigation because it bore no relationship to the services rendered and interfered unreasonably with access to the courts, (3) there was no significant relationship between the domestic violence services, (4) the legislature's choice to tax litigants was an arbitrary use of police power, and (5) there was no rational basis for imposing the tax only on dissolution litigants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's refusal to submit to a breath test upon his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol resulted in an automatic six-month suspension of his license. Defendant claimed that the implied consent statute was unconstitutional because it was contrary to the separation-of-powers provision of the state constitution and it violated an accused's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. The court reversed and held that the statute was not violative of the separation-of-powers clause because it simply provided that an accused's refusal to submit to a breath test was admissible as evidence at his trial. The legislature had the power to prescribe methods of proof. The right to remain silent was not equivalent to the right to refuse a breath test, thus evidence of a refusal was not constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to death for the murder conviction and 40 to 80 years' imprisonment for the sexual assault conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err by proceeding to trial without conducting a fitness hearing because at the time of trial, the most recent psychiatric reports showed that defendant was fit for trial, defendant testified lucidly at his trial, and the only evidence of his unfitness was a report by one doctor who subsequently changed his opinion and another doctor's report made two years before trial. The trial court did not err by refusing to suppress statements defendant made to police because prior to the time he made the statements, the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant. Defendant was not under arrest because he voluntarily met with and accompanied the officers to the police station and therefore would have believed he was free to leave. The court overruled defendant's challenges to the death penalty's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, county sheriff and treasurer, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) finding in favor of plaintiff bank and ruling that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 37 (1979), which allowed payment of commissions to sheriffs out of revenue collected from the sale of foreclosed property, was unconstitutional. The bank cross-appealed the trial court's denial of certification of the action as a class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank filed suit against defendants, alleging that the sheriff collected illegal commissions from judicial sales of foreclosed property and paid them over to the county treasurer. The bank argued that the statute that authorized the collection of such commissions, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 37 (1979), was unconstitutional because Ill. Const. of 1970, art. VII, &sect; 9(a) prohibited the collection of such fees. The bank sought the enjoinment of the further collection of such fees and an accounting of such fees collected. The trial court ruled that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 37 (1979) was unconstitutional and ordered the sheriff and the treasurer to account for all fees collected. The sheriff and the treasurer appealed, arguing that the action was an invalid collateral attack on valid court orders. The court modified the order, holding that the fact that a statute upon which an order was based was void did not deprive a court of jurisdiction. Judgments in a civil proceeding could only be collaterally attacked where there was a total want of jurisdiction. Thus, the sheriff and the treasurer were only required to account for fees received where a court had not approved the fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court. However, it modified the order of the trial court and ordered that the sheriff and the treasurer were only required to account for those funds received as fees on sales not thereafter approved by orders of the court. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the bank's request for certification of the suit as a class action. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was charged with murder and armed violence based on having committed murder while armed. The trial court, upon a jury verdict, acquitted the defendant of murder but convicted him of the second offense. The appellate court reversed the conviction, finding that it was improper because the state failed to prove the predicate felony of murder, an essential element of the armed violence offense. The state appealed and the court affirmed, finding that the verdicts were not legally inconsistent. The court determined that under Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 (1970) no appeal was permitted on the murder charge because defendant had already been acquitted thereon and it remained a final determination on that issue. The court concluded that collateral estoppel prevented the retrial on the armed violence charge alone because to retry defendant on that charge alone would unconstitutionally require him to relitigate the element of murder, an element on which defendant had already been acquitted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the classification of marijuana was arbitrary and irrational. Reversing, the court held that marijuana and the drugs barbiturates, amphetamines, and peyote were not similarly situated, and by placing marijuana in a separate statute, the legislature identified it as constituting a particular social concern.

The village sought to dismiss, citing &sect; 1, 1.1 of &quot;An Act in relation to delinquent taxes and special assessments&quot; (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 891.1 (1981). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found the Act unconstitutional and the village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondholders alleged that the funds collected had been commingled or improperly transferred and that the village had not paid to them all of the sums that it had collected. The village countered by citing the Act, which permitted the cancellation of certain bonds that had been delinquent for over 30 years. The trial court found &sect; 1, 1.1 of the Act were unconstitutional impairments of contractual obligations in violation of the federal and state constitutions. On the village's appeal, the court affirmed. The court first held that, in applying the doctrine of severability, the bond-cancellation provisions of the Act could not stand alone. The challenged sections of the Act did not become part of the bondholders' contracts because only statutes in force at the time a contract was made were incorporated therein. The justifications offered by the village, simplifying municipal record keeping and eliminating the possibility of stale claims, were simply insufficient bases for upholding a statute which, without notice of any type, permitted cancellation of valid bonds and conversion of undisbursed funds in violation of the federal and Illinois constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which had found certain sections of the Act unconstitutional in the bondholders' action against the village for a declaration of an express trust and for an accounting.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied the governor and director's motion to dismiss the complaint and entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the inmates. On appeal, the court reversed the order. The court held that: (1) the transportation clause was violated only if and when the transportation of prisoners constituted cruel and unusual punishment; (2) the objective of the compact was to serve the best interests of the inmatesby alleviating security and health problems associated with overcrowding in Illinois prisons; (3) although out-of-state transfers involved certain hardships to the inmates and made visitation more burdensome, such transfers were neither unusual nor cruel in the constitutional sense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for attempted armed robbery and murder, but vacated the death sentence due to the cumulative impact of the errors in the sentencing hearing. Defendant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was violated because the judge refused to instruct the jury that it should not consider defendant's silence as evidence of his guilt. In addition, the prosecutor's statements concerning defendant's silence were highly prejudicial. The prosecutor improperly called the deceased's widow to the stand because she had no evidence of probative value concerning sentencing. Instead, she was used to elicit sympathy from the jury. The prosecutor prejudiced defendant in his closing argument by repeatedly referring to the deceased as a police officer because the deceased's status was not a factor to be taken into account for deciding whether to impose the death penalty. The court affirmed the admission of defendant's other crimes and his trial testimony at the sentencing hearing. The court did not address defendant's argument that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional because it reversed his sentence on other grounds. The court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

A mental health report was prepared on defendant, and it stated that defendant had been at a mental health center for the past nine years. Acting on requests by defendant and the state, a discharge hearing was held. The lower court found that the state had proved that defendant was sane at the time and was guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. It also found that defendant was in need of treatment. Defendant's motion that his sentence for treatment be reconsidered was denied, and &sect; 104-28(a) was held unconstitutional. The state argued that the section was unconstitutional because it was a legislative grant of amnesty that encroached upon the executive branch's power to pardon. The court did not perceive how the statute would be any more vulnerable than a statute of limitations or a speedy-trial statute. Therefore, the lower court erred in holding the provision to be unconstitutional. The evidence was overwhelming that defendant committed the crimes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of ten percent in violation of Ill.

When the lower court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the first count, the prosecution appealed. The court found that (1) defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a)(1) (1981), (2) the issue was ripe for judicial determination where defendant would suffer harm if convicted of the criminal offense with which he had been charged, (3) the statute did not create a due process violation because the legislature had permissibly determined that the ten percent blood alcohol concentration constituted impairment, and (4) because the statute did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof, the court reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The booksellers appealed, and the court affirmed. To determine whether &sect; 251 was properly enacted, the court applied the journal-entry rule, which presumed that a statute signed by the presiding officers of each branch of the general assembly and approved by the governor was enacted in accordance with constitutional requirements. The presumption afforded by the journal-entry rule could be overcome by clear and convincing proof that the constitutional procedure was not followed. Here, the journals did not show compliance with the constitutionally mandated procedure for enactment. Rather, they presented clear and convincing evidence that the bill that was passed by both houses was not the bill that the governor approved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, various boards and departments of the City of Chicago, Ill., appealed two judgments of the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which affirmed the circuit court's decisions that Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code ch. 25, &sect; 30 was unconstitutionally vague and that Chicago, Ill., Police Dep't. R. 25 was invalid. The ordinance and the rule set forth residency requirements for municipal employees. The court consolidated the appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the personnel board ordered the discharge of plaintiffs, two firefighters and a water department engineer, for violating the ordinance, which required civil service employees to be &quot;actual residents&quot; of the City. In the second case, plaintiff police officer was discharged for violations of the rule, which was based on the ordinance. The rule required the police officer &quot;to actually reside&quot; within the City limits. The appellate court reversed both decisions because it found the ordinance to be unconstitutional. Upon consolidated appeal by defendants, the court reversed and held that the appellate court erred in holding that that the word &quot;residence&quot; was too vague to guide agencies. The court held that the word &quot;residence&quot; was intended to be synonymous with &quot;domicile.&quot; The enactments required the employees to establish their principal residence, that is, their domicile, in the City. Accordingly, the rule and the ordinance were not constitutionally infirm for not setting out strict guidelines to follow in determining residence. While there may have been &quot;merely erroneous action,&quot; the court found no evidence of intentional discrimination by the personnel board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgments. It remanded the causes to the appellate court for consideration of the question of the sufficiency of the evidence because the appellate court, having found the rule and the ordinance to be unconstitutional, did not reach the other objections of plaintiffs to their discharges. The court did not decide whether the denial of attorney fees to one firefighter was proper as the constitutional holdings were in error.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 716a (1979), in plaintiff trustee's declaratory judgment suit filed on behalf of a beneficiary who owned real property sold under the Scavenger Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was sold at a scavenger sale, which differed from the usual tax sale in that the total amount was not required to be bid. The sale was confirmed by the circuit court. The trustee sought to redeem the property by tendering the amount of the bid on the property at the sale, plus interest and costs. The clerk refused the tendered amount, based on an amendment to the statutory and constitutional provisions in effect at the time of the sale. The provisions stated that property sold at a tax sale could be redeemed within two years from the sale. The challenged amendment to the statute provided an exception in the treatment of single family homes. It was found unconstitutionally vague by the circuit court. The clerk appealed. That court vacated the circuit court judgment without expressing an opinion as to its merits, and dismissed the case. It held that, while there might have been a live controversy at the time the action was brought, subsequent events rendered the issue moot, because the petition was not timely filed as required under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 747 (1981).</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-6 (1981) was unconstitutional because it discriminated between the treatment of incarcerated and nonincarcerated defendants by requiring a course of mental treatment for incarcerated defendants. The state appealed. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and held that para. 1005-2-6 (1981) did not deprive individuals of equal protection of the laws. The difference in the way incarcerated and nonincarcerated defendants were treated was only in the entity which was empowered to make the determination as to what course of medical treatment would have been appropriate. By vesting the Illinois Department of Corrections with the power to determine the defendant's needs and to implement treatment, the statute reflected the well-established view that the judiciary was ill equipped to supervise and evaluate the treatment of incarcerated defendants.</SPAN></P>

The state attorneys disagreed with the director's interpretation of the statute. In this original action, the court held that the statute conferred authority on the director to grant no more than a total of 90 days additional good conduct credit for meritorious service. The court held that prospective application of this interpretation was advisable based on the reliance placed on the statute's construction by prisoners.

The appellate court held the Illinois Scavenger Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 716a (1979), required sale of property with delinquent taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax collector filed an application for judgment and order of sale under the Act that included all parcels in the county for which real estate taxes remained unpaid for at least five years.

The trial court granted the motion and some of the owners of the real property with delinquent taxes objected.

The court ruled that, consistent with the terms of the Act and its legislative intent, the circuit court had discretionary authority to withhold parcels from the delinquent property sale. The court found that the trial court was not required to enter judgment and an order of sale regardless of circumstances or regardless of whether the public interest would be served.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was denied a fair hearing on the motion to suppress the identification testimony. The court held that it could not agree that the trial judge erred in denying defendant's motions to suppress.

The court concluded that the trial judge did not err in permitting child to testify. Defendant further contended that the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict of not guilty on the charge of rape. The court agreed that the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict of not guilty on the charge of rape since the evidence failed to establish penetration to any degree.

After review, the court concluded that defendant was not deprived of a speedy trial, he was ably and competently represented at all stages of the proceedings, and admission of co-defendant's statement did not constitute reversible error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a union representative contacted by certain employees who hoped to obtain union representation. Defendant obtained the employees' consent and then went to the employer's office and threatened to shut down the employer's operation through strike unless the union representation was recognized. On that basis, defendant was charged and convicted under the intimidation statute and, on appeal to the Second District, the conviction was reversed and the intimidation statute was found overly broad and unconstitutional. On appeal from that ruling, the court reversed and found the intimidation statute was broad, but was not so broad so as to be deemed unconstitutional. Defendant claimed that the statute was overbroad because it made it a criminal violation to engage in uninhibited discussion and effectively prohibited speech that was clearly protected by the First Amendment. The court found, to the contrary, that while under the intimidation statute one could be prosecuted for threatening to picket in front of a city hall without a permit, any such conceivable impermissible applications were dwarfed by the statute's legitimate reach in prohibiting threatened criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed ordinances for the purpose of urban redevelopment of the city's business district and sought to accomplish redevelopment by exercising the power of eminent domain.

The ordinances sought to define the notice procedures of the courts, duties of parties in court, and specific remedies available in court proceedings. The court held that the city was attempting to set forth rules for the state judiciary to follow and that was a matter of state concern, not a local function that pertained to the home rule unit's government and affairs. The court held that the ordinances did not pertain to the government and affairs of the city and were not local in character. The court held that although the city's purpose in enacting the ordinances pertained to local government and affairs, the method of enforcement prescribed to carry out the eminent domain proceedings was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a consent search, police found a homemade bomb in defendant's home and charged defendant with unlawful use of weapons in violation of para. 24-1(a)(7). The trial court held that para. 24-1(a)(7) was unconstitutional because of the disparity in punishment for a violation of that statute as compared to para. 24-1(a)(3), which prohibited similar conduct. The State sought review, and the court noted that while para. 24-1(a)(7) clearly referred to explosive devices, para. 24-1(a)(3) referred to any device, including a bomb, containing noxious liquid gas. The court concluded that the legislature intended to differentiate between explosives and other devices and that there was a sufficient difference between the devices to justify the difference in penalties without violating defendant's due process rights. The court noted that the disparate treatment was reasonable because of the greater capacity for injury from an explosive than from tear gas. The court finally noted that the fact that para. 24-1(a)(7) could have been held unconstitutionally vague in other cases did not affect its validity with respect to defendant's conduct, which was clearly proscribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>

It was proper to deny the right to call witnesses to challenge the propriety or effectiveness of the death penalty in general. It was not improper for a defendant's attorney to testify as to defendant's demeanor, as demeanor was not a confidential communication.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, aggravated kidnapping, and rape and sentenced to death. Upon defendant's initial appeal, the death sentence was vacated because the court found that one of the aggravating factors did not exist. At resentencing, defendant asked the trial court to preclude a capital sentencing hearing based upon a promise of the prosecutor not to ask for the death penalty. The trial court denied the motion and defendant was again sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed, finding initially that the issue of whether the prosecutor was precluded from asking for the death penalty was not waived. Although the issue was not raised in the first direct appeal, the trial court did consider the issue on remand; thus, it was properly before the court on appeal. The court found that when defendant was arrested the state's attorney told defendant's counsel that he would not seek the death penalty if defendant confessed to the murder. Defendant confessed early the next morning without the offer having been revoked. The state offered no justification for not abiding by the promise. Due process required that the state's attorney be bound by his promise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The death sentence imposed on defendant for his convictions for murder, aggravated kidnapping, and rape was vacated. The cause was remanded for resentencing with directions that the death penalty was not to be considered.</SPAN></P>

The state's criminal information alleged that defendant, while armed with a revolver, detained his estranged wife without legal authority. The trial court dismissed the charge of armed violence and held that the Illinois armed-violence statute, Ill. Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the sentences which were available for the offense of armed violence based on unlawful restraint with a Category I weapon and for the more serious offense of aggravated kidnapping were unconstitutionally disproportionate. The sentencing scheme violated the constitutional assurances of proportionate penalties and due process because the penalty for forcible detention was less than that for armed violence based on unlawful restraint although unlawful restraint was a lesser included offense of forcible detention.</SPAN></P>

As such, &sect; 404 constituted a violation of the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution. Furthermore, at the time of these offenses, &sect; 404 had not yet been amended; therefore, prosecution of the three defendants was precluded. Finally, the court held that to the extent People v.

The court held that (1) the trial was fair and impartial because defendant failed to prove that black jurors were systematically excluded by the prosecution; (2) the comments did not constitute reversible error because they were not so inherently prejudicial that an instruction could not have corrected the situation; (3) the seizure of items from defendant's home was not improper; (4) the indictment was sufficient to support the death sentence because defendant knew that the state was seeking the death penalty; (5) defendant was not denied a fair sentencing hearing; (6) there was sufficient proof of aggravating factors; and (7) defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial because the 160-day limit of Ill.

The court found that &sect; 29 of the Act provided an additional method to challenge the board's regulations and was not an exclusive procedure and the corporation's previous compliance with rule 202 did not estop it from challenging its validity because any acceptance of the rule's validity was involuntary. The court determined that the relationship between rules 202 and 103(g)(1) was close and substantial and required the invalidation of rule 202 because the board made no separate determination that rule 202 was economically reasonable.

The appellate court reversed and found that defendant was eligible for supervision under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-1(c) (1981). The state appealed and the court affirmed. The sole issue concerned the construction of &sect; 1005-6-1(c), which empowered a court, upon a plea of guilty or stipulation by defendant of facts that supported the finding of guilt, to defer further proceedings and enter an order for supervision. The state contended the statute applied only if defendant pleaded guilty or stipulated to facts supporting her guilt. Defendant argued that it also applied if she was found guilty after trial. The court found that the statute was ambiguous and referred to the legislative history to aid in the statute's construction. The court concluded that the statute was not intended to change the prior practice, which was to allow supervision upon a finding of guilty after trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony theft and tampering with a motor vehicle. The charge was enhanced to a felony because of defendant's prior conviction for armed robbery. Defendant pleaded guilty to felony theft in exchange for dropping the charge of tampering with a motor vehicle. While on probation, defendant was charged with attempted retail theft. He pleaded guilty and the state filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation on the basis of his theft conviction. The circuit court revoked defendant's probation and sentenced him to two years in prison. The appellate court held that robbery could be used to enhance a misdemeanor theft to a felony, but agreed with defendant that his probation could not be revoked on the basis of a guilty plea entered without the assistance of counsel. The appellate court remanded the case. The court held that robbery was not an aggravated form of theft capable of enhancing a misdemeanor theft to a felony. The court held that because defendant could not have been convicted of felony theft, the order of probation based on the conviction was void, and the two-year prison sentence based on revocation of his probation was likewise void.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that Public Act 82-645 (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2401 et seq. (1981), violated the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act provided that a portion of the fees paid for marriage licenses and dissolutions, which were collected by county clerks and circuit court clerks, were to be deposited into a domestic violence fund by the county clerks. The county clerk and circuit court clerk challenged the constitutionality of the Act. The circuit court held that the Act was unconstitutional because it required the county clerks, not the county treasurers, to deposit the funds. That judgment was appealed by the director and the interest group. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and remanded the matter. Courts were required to presume that the legislature intended to enact a constitutional statute. While Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9 required that fees collected by a unit of local government be deposited with its treasurer, the court concluded that the Act's reference to the county clerk was simply an error given the legislature's obvious awareness of the Illinois Constitution. Furthermore, courts were permitted to substitute one word for another when it was necessary to carry out the obvious intent of the legislature. Therefore, the Act, as originally enacted, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the imposition of the death penalty. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for issuance of the search warrant. Prior entries into defendant's house were reasonable, necessary, and justified as valid &quot;protective sweeps&quot; because there was a high potential for danger surrounding the arrest. The police knew that a gun was used in the offense, that defendant did not have it when he was captured, and that someone in the house could possibly have access to the weapon. The court held that defendant was not entitled to use the insanity defense because toxic psychosis induced by voluntary intoxication was not a mental disease or mental defect under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 6-2(a) (1977). The admission of certain physical evidence and photographs was not prejudicial because they were relevant to establish the existence of a material fact that defendant was familiar with guns and to connect defendant with the murder weapon. The indictment sufficiently informed defendant that the death penalty could be sought because he was charged with murder and attempted rape.</SPAN></P>

The court found that several witnesses positively identified the accomplice as having been with defendant on the day of the crime and that the witnesses corroborated the accomplice's testimony. The court held that the identification procedure was proper because each potential witness was interviewed separately and shown a photo display without any other person in the immediate vicinity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county wanted to assess and tax nine parcels of land owned by a railroad company, but the appellate court held that the parcels were exempt from local property tax for 1971-72 under &sect; 22 of the Illinois Central Charter, Ill.

The court noted if the form of ballot was objectionable because of the location of a box on a perforated line, the objection should have been raised prior to the election rather than after the results were proclaimed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that insufficient evidence supported his conviction, that the imposition of the death penalty was improper under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--1(c)(5) (1978 Supp.), or alternatively, that it was unconstitutional to impose death based on accountability. Defendant also claimed that he was denied a fair trial. The court affirmed the lower court's conviction of defendant and its imposition of the death penalty, holding that sufficient evidence showed that defendant was guilty of murder, armed violence, and unlawful restraint under the principal of accountability. Defendant was a principal character in a common enterprise to commit acts of violence, from which defendant did not withdraw. Moreover, defendant received a fair trial even though simultaneous trials with multiple juries were conducted, such that both juries would be present for the testimony of any defendant. Nor did that modified severance procedure violate the Constitution.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(a)(1) (1979) and pleaded guilty to the charges. The jury found unanimously that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude a sentence of death and returned a sentence of death for each of the three murders. The sentences were stayed pending direct appeal. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(g) (1979) was constitutional because preclusion of the death penalty did not require a complete defense to the aggravating factors. The court held that the requirement that the information introduced in the aggravation and mitigation phase be relevant imposed sufficient restraints on the exercise of the prosecutor's discretion. The inquiry into defendant's past misconduct contained in a presentence investigation report was within reasonable bounds. The court found no reversible error as to the murders of two of the victims. However, the sentence imposed for the murder of another victim was vacated for the imposition of a sentence other than death because nothing in the record showed that defendant killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill that victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State was given leave to appeal as a matter of right the judgment of the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which held that &sect; 12, Ill.

The appellate court reversed the judgment. The court reversed the appellate court and reinstated the circuit court conviction. The court rejected the argument that the Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 712 (1977) provided an unintelligible standard in that it stated the agency could provide exemptions from certain provisions of the act if it found that it was &quot;in the public interest&quot; to do so. The court held that the standard had to be read in context, and, in the context of the purposes of the act, the standard survived constitutional scrutiny. The statute did not violation the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses because regulations passed pursuant to the statute provided that the agency had to follow procedural due process before permitting such exemptions and all final orders of the agency were subject to review. Thus, the agency's power was not exercised arbitrarily or without restrictions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 467.1 et seq. (1979). After the trial court exempted intrastate charges but included interstate charges in taxable revenues, the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) ruled for the company on all claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company claimed that the tax could not be imposed on certain revenues. When the appeals court agreed, the DOR appealed. The court affirmed. It held that the language and history of the tax statute did not permit imposition of the tax on interstate messages, because the law that prevailed at the time the statute was adopted prohibited occupation taxes on interstate commerce, because the interpretation was consistent with historical administrative interpretations, and because tax laws were to be strictly construed against the state. The court also affirmed a ruling that no tax was payable on revenues which, while they were reflected in the company's records, actually were attributable to and transmitted to other local phone companies under division-of-revenue formulas. The court found that the only reason that those amounts were reflected in the company's records was because the company served as an &quot;administrator&quot; for all of the local phone companies and was responsible for calculating and redistributing revenues based on actual usage of the constituent phone lines, and that the tax was to be imposed only on that portion of billings that the company retained under the formula.</SPAN></P>

Following a bench trial, the trial judge found both convicted individuals guilty in the &quot;manner and form&quot; charged in the indictment. Based on another case, the trial judge concluded that the statutory classification was unconstitutional; he sentenced the convicted individuals as Class 3 felons. The court reversed the appellate court decision in the other case, and remanded the instant case to the trial court with directions for resentencing in accordance with law. The convicted individuals filed another motion for a new trial, which the trial judge granted. The court held that a writ of mandamus was to issue directing the trial judge to comply with the court's prior mandate for resentencing. The trial judge's order failed to comply with the court's earlier mandate, and for that reason the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to enter his order granting a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered a refund on the ground that the department violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, paras. 1001 et seq. The department appealed and the oil corporation filed a cross-appeal, alleging the Use Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.1 et seq., was unconstitutionally ambiguous. The court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the crude oil purchased by the corporation was a &quot;sale at retail&quot; and tax rules permitted taxation of the entire sale when only part of the property is for &quot;use,&quot; that the intra-agency memorandum on taxing calculations was not a rule under the APA so the department did not violate the act, and that there was no constitutional infirmity because the rule only memorialized existing case law so the corporation had notice of the law.</SPAN></P>

The other defendant was convicted of rape and robbery. In a consolidated appeal, the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) affirmed the convictions and sentences of both defendants. Defendants appealed, both contending that the trial court failed to state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence as required by Ill. Rev.

The statute was not mandatory, therefore there was no independent duty upon the trial court to give a statement of reasons. Instead, the right was purely personal to defendants. The court held that because defendants had failed to request statements of reasons for their particular sentences, they had waived the issue. The statute did entitle defendants to statements of reasons for their sentences and it would be error for the trial court to refuse to make statements if requested.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, specifically Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 401(3) (1977), appropriate circumstances had to exist before a trial judge could enter a judgment of dissolution and reserve questions of child custody, support, maintenance, or property disposition. The husband disagreed and also argued that a legislative amendment to the statute retroactively validated the trial court's action. The amendment attempted to validate prior bifurcated judgments of dissolution like the one here. The court upheld the appellate court's judgment and held that the amendment was unconstitutional. First, the trial court could not under the original statute enter a bifurcated judgment of dissolution in the case. Second, although the legislature may change the law as interpreted by the courts prospectively, it cannot retroactively alter a statute to overrule a decision of a reviewing court. Here, the amendment was an unconstitutional attempt to invalidate retroactively the action of the appellate court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an inmate was hung by a rope and killed, defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in accordance with the jury's determination that there were no mitigating factors to preclude a sentence of death. The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction, holding that no error resulted from the failure of defendant to be present when the jury viewed the jail premises and there was no evidence to support defendant's tendered instruction on involuntary manslaughter. The court vacated defendant's death sentence, determining that the jury was permitted to consider certain information without adequate limiting instructions. The jury heard numerous witnesses testify that defendant discussed numerous ways to kill or torture people and made several confessions of murder. Because defendant's sociopathic personality may have produced such fantasies and there was no evidence of such crimes, the circuit court erred by failing to provide a cautionary instruction that there was no corroborating evidence which tended to prove that any of the conduct had occurred. The court remanded the case to the circuit court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county board adopted a resolution pursuant to &sect; 162a calling for a referendum on a proposal to increase the tax-rate. The question was to be voted upon in November. A month later, respondent taxpayer filed a petition pursuant to &sect; 162a calling for an election on a proposal to decrease the tax-rate, which was held in March of the same year. The taxpayer argued that &sect; 162a limited elections on tax rates to one per year and that the first tax-rate election held in a calendar year would supercede any tax-rate election already scheduled for later in the year. The court found that &sect; 162a was constitutional and disagreed with the taxpayer's interpretation of the section. The court held that the legislature intended that the party who first properly initiated a request for a tax-rate election to be held in a calendar year had priority over parties subsequently requesting a tax-rate election for the same year. The taxpayer's submission of a tax-rate proposition conflicted with &sect; 162a because it was initiated a month after the county board requested a tax-rate election in the same year. The court held that the results of the March election were void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that a writ of mandamus filed in another simultaneously pending case did not toll a 160-day limitations period in the prosecution of defendant, since there was no relationship demonstrated between the mandamus action and the delay in the subject prosecution. Also, the court held that the 160-day period within which defendant was required to be tried was not tolled by any delay attributable to defendant in a simultaneously pending case, particularly where the delay which occurred in the simultaneously pending case was not demonstrated to be related to the delay in bringing defendant to trial. Further, the trial court's dismissal of the indictment on the 158th day of 160-day statutory term did not constitute reversible error, where the source of miscalculation was the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Debtors defaulted on their mortgage and the bank sought foreclosure of their home. The debtors asserted that the bank had waived enforcement of the once-in-every-five-years limitation contained in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95, para. 57 (1979) because it had previously allowed them to reinstate their mortgage twice in two years. The court on appeal first found that the statute did not violate equal protection because the class of persons who have never defaulted was rationally different than those who have previously defaulted and was related to a legitimate state interest in allowing a debtor plagued once by problems to keep his home. The court further found that the right to reinstate a mortgage was unknown at common law was purely statutory and could thus be limited by the legislature. The court also ruled that the statute did not infringe on the equitable powers of the court, again, because no common law rights were involved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the juveniles were entitled to be admitted to bail. The court first noted that the Juvenile Court Act made no provision either for interlocutory appeals or for bail. Case law indicated that the state was permitted to take an interlocutory, pre-adjudication appeal from a juvenile court's order denying a motion to prosecute a minor as an adult, but that the minor had no right to an immediate appeal of an order permitting transfer to adult court. Nothing in the case law or the Act itself required that a juvenile be released without bail pending the state's appeal. However, this did not mean that the minor could be held without a reasonable bail being set. The state constitution granted the right to bail for all but capital offenses, and this guarantee applied to juveniles as well as to adults. While, in general, the standards that applied to the determination of a reasonable bail for juveniles were the same that applied to adults, in the circumstance where the juvenile was detained pending the state's appeal, it was up to the state to show compelling reasons necessitating holding the minor to bail before bail could be required.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered an order allowing the state to sell the vehicle. The appellate court reversed the order. This appeal followed. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. Here, the effect of &sect; 4-107(i) was to strip the purchaser of all rights to the vehicle by declaring it as contraband even though he was completely innocent and had no way of discovering any wrongdoing. Although there was a presumption of validity attached to the exercise of the state's police power, the classification of the vehicle as contraband per se was unconstitutional. It did not appear that depriving the innocent purchaser of his property furthered either purpose of the statute. The purchaser took the necessary steps to assure that the VIN located at the place required by regulations matched the VIN on the title, and that was all that was constitutionally required.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the former defendants for the court costs and the denial of summary judgment with regard to the fines.

The trial court agreed that the Act was unconstitutional. The Department appealed. On review, the townships argued that the Act violated Ill. Const. Art.

The court disagreed, finding that no referendum was required because the legislature had the power to fix and limit the powers of township officers at will. Thus, the argument that the consolidation of the assessor's positions was without merit. Further, the Act did not affect the entirety of the township scheme.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1404 (1977), by delivering .4 grams of a substance represented to have been heroin and the imposition of a two-year imprisonment sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violation of &sect; 404 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act (Act), codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1404 (1977) for delivering a substance he represented as being heroin. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that &sect; 404 of the Act was unconstitutional as violative of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970) because it was not reasonably designed to remedy the evil which the legislature determined to have been a greater threat to the public. Specifically, the court found that defendant was subject to a greater penalty for delivery of .4 grams of a harmless brown powder than a person who would have actually delivered any amount of a schedule IV or V controlled substance under &sect; 401(e), (f) of the Act. Because the legislature clearly intended the delivery of actual controlled substances to have been more of a threat than the delivery of noncontrolled substances fraudulently represented as controlled substances, the statute should not have punished the latter offense more severely than the former. Defendant had standing to challenge the statute because he was among the group of persons aggrieved by its constitutional defect.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 261 et seq., on the ground that the Act's prohibition of unfair acts and practices was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General issued an administrative subpoena and demand for verified statements to an association in an investigation of possible violations of the Act. When the association failed to comply, complaints were filed to compel responses. The trial court dismissed the complaints, and the Attorney General appealed. The district appellate court held that probable cause was not required for the issuance of an administrative subpoena, but affirmed the dismissal because it found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 262, which prohibited unfair practices, was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the part of the judgment relating to probable cause, reversed the vagueness determination, reversed the trial court's dismissal for failure to state a cause of action, and remanded. The Act was not void for vagueness because it was sufficiently clear and definite to give adequate notice of the conduct it proscribed to persons of reasonable intelligence. The investigative powers granted under the Act did not violate the Fourth Amendment or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 because they were restricted to demands for reasonably definite information relevant to the Act's purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee and intervenor Department of Human Rights (Illinois) appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which dismissed the employee's complaint against defendant employer and held that &sect; 8.01a of the Fair Employment Practices Act, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 858.01a (1979), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employee was discharged by the employer, she filed a charge of sexual and racial discrimination with the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission. The Commission issued a complaint, which the Commission subsequently dismissed because it was not issued within the 180-day period required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 858.01 (1977). The employee then filed suit under para. 858.01a, which created a new cause of action for certain persons whose claims had been barred by administrative delay. The substance of para. 858.01a was later codified at &sect; 9-102(B) of the Illinois Human Rights Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 9-102(B) (1980 Supp.). The court held that the statutes constituted prohibited special legislation and violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. The court reasoned that no rational basis existed for the distinction created by the statutes. The court further held that the statutes violated the employer's due process rights by attempting to revive a previously-barred cause of action. Once the claim was barred by the 180-day period, the employer acquired a vested right in the application of that limitations period that the legislature could not take away.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board brought an action in the trial court after the commission affirmed an administrative order holding its plan for compulsory retirement at 65 illegal under the Illinois Human Rights Act, Ill.

Stat. ch. 68, para. 2-104(E) (1980), which permitted employers to apply different, non-discriminating standards of compensation or conditions of employment to older employees, was unconstitutionally vague and that the exemption did not apply to the board's plan. Both parties sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court but found that the exemption was not vague. The court held that the exemption permitted employers to treat older employees differently so long as that the treatment did not produce a discriminatory effect and provided examples of permissible actions, but that compulsory retirement before 70 was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for the armed robbery of a bank, kidnapping, and the murder of the bank's security guard, asserting numerous errors including that the death penalty statute was impermissibly vague, that the jury erred in finding no mitigating factor sufficient to preclude the death penalty, and that his trial counsel was incompetent. The court rejected defendant's contentions, finding that the death penalty statute was not invalid because the language of the statute concerning mitigating factors was not overly broad. The court noted that mitigating factors were not as precisely defined as aggravating factors because the latter were utilized to determine whether the death penalty was applicable. The court ruled that testimony that the security guard reached for his gun before defendant fired was not a mitigating factor that precluded the death penalty because the statute did not require such a finding. The court ruled that the alleged incidents of attorney incompetence were insufficient to establish defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because there was no reasonable possibility that the incidents contributed to the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees brought an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, challenging the statute as unconstitutional. The circuit court held that the employees were vested with a statutorily created property right that could not be terminated as provided in the statute. The circuit court found the statute unconstitutional and the directors appealed. The court reversed. The court held that the general assembly had the power to subject certain civil service positions to term appointments. Civil service status was not a vested right because it had been created by the general assembly and therefore could be changed by legislative action. There was no constitutional impediment to the general assembly's power to change the duration of the term of the appointments. The statute did not violate equal protection because there was a reasonable basis for the classification and the court declined to substitute its own judgment for that of the general assembly. Finally, the statute did not violate the prohibition against retrospective application of legislation because the general assembly retained the power to alter or abolish the employees' job status.

On further appeal the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find the pedestrian guilty of contributory negligence because he failed to keep a constant lookout for traffic. The court held that the circuit court properly rendered judgment for the driver because the special finding of fact was inconsistent with the general verdict for the pedestrian.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Attorney General had not exhausted his administrative remedies and was precluded from bringing an action for declaratory judgment.

The motorcyclist was found guilty of unknowingly possessing a vehicle without a required identification number. However, the case was subsequently dismissed because it was brought in the wrong county. The circuit court ordered the police to stamp the number on the motorcycle and return it to the motorcyclist. The State appealed, contending that the motorcyclist was required to pay storage fees under &sect; 4-207 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-207 (1977). The court affirmed, holding that para. 4-207 did not apply. All the legal proceedings arose under article I of the Code involving anti-theft laws, and para. 4-207 was part of article II of the Code involving abandoned, lost, stolen, or unclaimed vehicles. The payment of towing and storage fees under para. 4-207 was limited to vehicles released to the owner under para. 4-207, which implied that vehicles could be released under other parts of the Code without such payment.</SPAN></P>

The employee's father contested jurisdiction, and the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) affirmed the circuit court's refusal to join him as a party. The employers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers contended that an out-of-state resident submitted to the jurisdiction of Illinois when he committed a tort which caused a diminution of the funds of a corporation organized or headquartered in Illinois. The court held that the substantive matter with which the appeal was concerned was a Texas dispute. The court held that the tortious acts, if any, and the losses or injury were completed when they occurred in Texas. Accordingly, the court held that Texas was the place of the wrongs, and their commission could not reasonably or justifiably be transferred to Illinois by the rationale that their consequence reduced the amount of corporate assets in Illinois. The court held that the employee was subject to Illinois jurisdiction because the employee chose it, but the court found that no matter how much more convenient and economical it was to adjudicate the counterclaim against the employee, and the similar claim against the employee's father, in the same action in Illinois, the employee's father could not be brought under the authority of Illinois courts.

The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers were excluded from the racetracks after being indicted by grand juries for bribery. The drivers attacked on due process grounds the constitutionality of &sect; 9(e) of the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975 (Act), codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 8, para. 37 -- 9(e) (1979), which authorized the board to issue the exclusion orders. The court held that because the drivers attacked the constitutionality of the Act, they were not required to exhaust any administrative remedies. In analyzing whether due process required an evidentiary hearing prior to the deprivation of the property rights, the court found: 1) the economic harm claimed was not irreparable, because while the drivers were precluding from racing in Illinois, they could train and race their horses using other drivers and could participate in races outside of the state; 2) the grand jury indictments were just cause for the exclusions; and 3) there was a valid governmental interest in protecting the integrity of horse racing. Because only property rights were involved, mere postponement of judicial inquiry did not violate due process. Section 9(e) was held constitutional, and the injunctions should not have been issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials argued that the appellate court below erred when it raised, sua sponte, the fact that the cause had not yet been certified as a class action and ordered that the circuit court make that determination prior to making any final judgment on the merits. The reviewing court agreed and overturned the ruling. Where a motion to dismiss is made by a defendant, thereby placing in issue the sufficiency of a complaint, a trial court need not delay deciding the motion until the class certification question has been resolved. There is no requirement that the class certification be entertained first; a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action is not dependent on a decision on the class certification issue, since no class action can proceed unless a cause of action is stated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village filed a complaint charging defendant doctor with operating an ambulatory surgical treatment center without a license in violation of a village ordinance. The doctor filed a motion to dismiss, alleging the ordinance was unconstitutional, and the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) so held. The village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor urged that the ordinance was an unconstitutional restriction upon the decision by a woman and her doctor to obtain a first-trimester abortion; that it violated equal protection requirements; and that the ordinance was so vague and indefinite that he was unable to determine what type of conduct was proscribed. The court held that the portion of the definition of an ambulatory surgical treatment center which related to abortions was unable to stand because it severely restricted the fundamental privacy right to secure a first-trimester abortion, and it did so in a manner not uniformly applicable to medically analogous surgical procedures. The court found nothing unreasonable in the provisions concerning minimum standards for health care of all patients, including the additional requirements for obstetrical and gynecological procedures, considering the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of all center patients. Nor was the court persuaded by the doctor's argument that the ordinance was void for vagueness because the requirements it established were sufficiently definite to allow a person of ordinary sensibilities to understand what was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the doctor granting his motion to dismiss on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional and remanded the cause for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers obtained a ruling that county officials should not retain half of all real estate transfer taxes collected. The trial court set aside the disputed funds, which were invested by a trustee, and out of the funds awarded the taxpayers $ 108,000 in attorney fees, which the taxpayers contended was too little and the attorney general contended was too much. The attorney general further argued that the fund belonged to the state and that fees could not be awarded out of it without going through the Court of Claims under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 801 (1979). The court on appeal disagreed, finding no sovereign immunity violation. The court so held because the fund did not yet belong to the state and had been created only out of the efforts of the taxpayers. The court further noted that the class being represented was all taxpayers of the state of Illinois, who had prevailed and benefited through the efforts of the taxpayers' attorneys, and who thus could not be harmed by payment of the attorney fees out of the fund. However, the court did note that the fees awarded might be excessive, and it remanded for a determination of whether a fee of $ 250 per hour was too high.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first defendant was charged with armed violence, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A (1979) and aggravated battery. The second defendant was charged with armed violence, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A (1979), and illegal delivery of cannabis. The circuit court granted defendants' motions to dismiss the armed violence charges and declared Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A-2 (1979) unconstitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal of the first defendant's armed violence charge but otherwise reversed the circuit court's judgment. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A-1 and 33A-2 (1979) did not require that a weapon facilitate the predicate offense and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A (1979) was not vague. However, because criminal statutes were to be construed leniently and a specific statute was given precedence over a general statute, the court concluded that the general assembly did not intend the presence of a weapon to enhance a misdemeanor. The court declined to find that the second defendant had been deprived of due process as to para. 33A's sentencing provisions because he had not been judged guilty or sentenced on the charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted murder, armed violence, armed robbery, and aggravated kidnapping after he threatened a man with a knife and held it to his throat in order to get the man to drive him home. Defendant later dumped the victim and his companion and took the victim's car. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court, and affirmed the conviction in its entirety. The court found that the attempted murder was not a lesser included offense in the armed-violence charge, as the appellate court found, because the armed violence charge was based upon the underlying felony of aggravated battery. The court then found that defendant's behavior did support conviction for both attempted murder and for armed violence because there were two separate invasions of the victim's body, even though both were closely related by reason of the fact that they attacked the same area of his body and were close in time. Defendant's actions of moving the knife from the victim towards his companion amounted to an overt or outward manifestation sufficient to support a different offense, since the cutting necessarily involved a movement of some distance and would support a charge of battery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was employed by appellee tractor company as a finish painter and injured his foot when he stepped into a paint pot as he descended a ladder.

The commission affirmed the arbitrator's award for temporary total incapacity for work and for the permanent and complete loss of 50 percent of the use of his left foot but found that the claimant was not entitled to receive compensation for lost earnings under &sect; 138.8(d)(1) because &sect; 10(g) of the Act, Ill.

Section 138.10(g) clearly related to earnings and unambiguously excluded overtime earnings from consideration.

On appeal from the appellate court's reversal of the denial of the taxpayer's request for a refund, the court ruled that the Indiana gross income tax was not a tax in respect to the sale, purchase, or use of property within the meaning of &sect; 3(c) of the Use Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.3(3)(c) (1977), that the mere fact that the taxpayer contracted to pay the seller's gross income tax liability did not entitle the taxpayer to an exemption from the Illinois use tax, and that the taxpayer did not meet its burden of proving that it clearly came within the statutory exemption. The court also ruled that the failure to grant the taxpayer an exemption did not discriminate against interstate commence because there were two distinct taxable events upon which the local state could properly impose a tax.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 40, para. 1522 (1977) unconstitutional. The statute placed adoption records and original birth records under seal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An adult adoptee sought information about his birth family, but the adoptee did not claim a medical or psychological need for this information. The trial court dismissed the adoptee's action to declare Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1522 (1977) unconstitutional. This was the statute that authorized sealing birth and adoption records. On appeal, the adoptee claimed that his right to know his own identity was a fundamental right. The court disagreed and found that this right did not come within any recognized category of privacy protected by the Bill of Rights. The court further found that the statute was rational in light of the state's interest in protecting confidentiality integral to the adoption process, and that it did not unconstitutionally infringe upon an adoptee's right to discover his own identity. The court also rejected the adoptee's argument that the statute violated an adoptee's equal protection rights by creating a suspect class for which there was no state justification. The court noted that adoption was a legal process, the purpose of which was to promote the best interests of the child. The court held that the adoption statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Appellate Court, Third District (Illinois) affirmed the method's applicability and reversed the deductions. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed separate state corporate income tax returns and then claimed refunds because they misapplied the unitary method of appointment. Plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to claim a deduction on their state returns for taxes paid to foreign governments regardless of whether they claimed a tax credit or a deduction on their federal income tax returns. Intervenors argued that the unitary reporting method was not applicable and violated due process. The director objected to the intervention of the 16 corporations. The court concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it granted the petition for intervention and that the appellate court was correct in applying the unitary method and denying the deductions. The court analyzed the legislative history of the Illinois Income Tax Act and related income tax acts to determine that the use of the combined or unitary apportionment method was authorized and could be required in the case of unitary business groups. Plaintiffs' election to take a tax credit for foreign taxes paid on their federal income tax returns was binding on their state returns. Thus, they were not entitled to the deductions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayers, appealed the decision of the Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois), which reversed in part and affirmed in part the order of the circuit court that denied class certification of taxpayers' action. Defendant, property tax appeal board, challenged the decision of the Appellate Court for the Fifth District (Illinois), which reversed the circuit court's decision finding certain tax assessments invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the appeal from the Second District, taxpayers, purporting to act as representatives of a class, sought to have property tax officials comply with &sect; 318.1 of the Revenue Act of 1939, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 120, par. 799.1. Both appellate courts found &sect; 318.1 unconstitutional. Section 318.1 was a validating act making legal and effective all assessments, irrespective of the failure to comply with timely publication. First, the court found that the relationship between the purported class representatives and the non-plaintiff class attorneys was in question. Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to certify the purported class. The court held next that &sect; 318.1 did not violate the principle of separation of powers or the due process rights of taxpayers. The court held that the legislature could cure a defect in a tax levy where the defect was the failure to observe a requirement of the law without which the legislature would not have authorized the levy. Further the court held that Public Act 80-1471, of which &sect; 318.1 was a part, did not violate the constitution's prohibition against more than one subject in an act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the Second District appeal, the court reversed the appellate court insofar as it held the real estate tax assessments invalid and affirmed insofar as it remanded to the circuit court to determine the existence of an appropriate subclass. As to the Fifth District appeal, the judgment of the appellate court was reversed and that of the circuit court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the police were required to advise all arrestees charged with a misdemeanor of their right to post bail immediately, that defendant had the right to and could post bail, that the police had no right to detain him and had no need or right to conduct a search; thus, the search was unauthorized, the seizure of the drugs was illegal, and the evidence was suppressed. On appeal from that decision, the court noted that there was no requirement that defendant be orally advised by the police of his right to post bail and that defendant mentioned a prior felony conviction, which would require that the officers ascertain whether his weapons charge would be a Class 3 felony. He could not be permitted to immediately post bail for a misdemeanor and be released. The court reversed the decision of the appellate court; defendant's strip-search was incident to a lawful arrest and was proper prior to his detention to safeguard the detention facility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, county, sheriff, and treasurer, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff judgment creditor and members of the class that paid fees pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 71 (1977), ordered an accounting, granted a preliminary injunction that declared the fee provision of the statute unconstitutional, and dismissed plaintiff banks from the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff and the county challenged the trial court's judgment and the banks challenged the portion of the judgment that dismissed them from the action. The court modified the judgment and affirmed the judgment as modified. The court held that Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a) applied to both tax and non-tax funds, and that the funds received by the sheriff in connection with foreclosure sales, execution of judgments, and redemptions were collected funds within the contemplation of &sect; 9(a). Therefore, the court determined that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 71 (1977) contravened Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a). The court also held that the payments made to the sheriff were not voluntary, the record provided no basis on which to have invoked laches to bar the judgment creditor's action, and pecuniary harm came to certain identifiable entities that were required to have paid the fees exacted by the sheriff and there was no equitable reason to have held that reimbursement should not have been made.

The judgment was further modified to provide the judgment creditor and the class an accounting. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the specification in the Act of the causes for removal of the commissioners of a housing authority was not impermissibly vague and certain. The court held that the hearing provided by &sect; 4 comported with the requirements of due process because despite the commissioners' contention prehearing discovery was not constitutionally required and that there was no evidence that the hearing would not have been impartial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were (1) whether Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2222(11) (1977) was vague, and thereby deprived the dentist of his constitutional right to due process, and (2) whether unprofessional conduct included conduct of the type alleged against the dentist. The Department alleged that the dentist engaged in unprofessional conduct by providing his patients with improper treatment, and they sought to revoke his dentist and orthodontist licenses on those grounds. The dentist sought and received a temporary restraining order against the Department. The trial court found the statute void and entered a permanent injunction that prevented the Department from conducting a hearing to suspend or revoke the dentist's licenses. The court reversed that decision and held that when the statute was considered in light of the goal of providing competent dental treatment for the benefit of the health, safety and welfare of the public, the legislative purpose would be frustrated if the statute did not encompass repeated acts of negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary in a bench trial for having entered an auto parts store and taking a can of oil having a retail value of $ 1.55.

The prosecutor brought an original proceeding for mandamus to compel the trial judge to expunge the sentence and resentence defendant. The court granted the writ and held that: (1) under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 1005-5-3(c)(2)(F), 1005-8-1(a)(5) (1979), defendant, a prior offender, was not eligible for parole; (2) the trial court was aware of the applicable statutes and there was no basis for a proceeding to correct trial errors under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 72 (1979); (3) defendant, a repeat offender, was to be treated more harshly because of his failure to correct his conduct, and not the value of the property that he took; and (4) in this mandamus action the court could not consider defendant's request for a reduced sentence under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615, 73 Ill. 2d R. 615, because the court was limited to issues of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, nine city council members, challenged the judgement of the Appellate Court for the Fourth District (Illinois), which affirmed the circuit court's judgement that the city council members violated the Open Meetings Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 102, par. 41 et seq. (1977). Appellee state's attorney filed a declaratory judgement action against them because they met and conferred privately in advance of a special meeting of the city council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council consisted of 15 members. One evening, an hour and a half prior to a special meeting of the council, nine members met at the home of one of the members. Eight of the nine members were members of the county democratic party. At the meeting they discussed four of the five city council matters that were on the agenda as well as party matters. At the council meeting, three votes were taken on matters previously discussed at the private meeting. The state's attorney for the county filed a declaratory judgement action against the nine members, and sought a declaration that they had violated the Open Meetings Act (Act). The circuit court entered judgement in favor of the state's attorney, which was affirmed by the appellate court. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgement. It held that the private meeting was not merely a political caucus because public matters were deliberated at the meeting, which put it in the ambit of the Act. It held there was no denial of the nine members' rights to equal protection or due process under the U.S. Constitution or state constitution. It held that the Act did not violate their rights of freedom of speech and assembly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgement. It held that the nine city council members constituted more than a quorum and any meeting they had where they discussed any pending city council matters was required to comply with the open meetings statute. The statute did not violate their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a political coalition, proposed a constitutional amendment to the Illinois Constitution. They maintained that the reliance by respondents, State Board of Elections, on Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 28-1.1 (1979), which required invalidation of whole sheets of signatures from consideration because of the presence of one or more nonconforming signatures, violated Ill. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3. The court held that the penalty provided -- the disqualification of entire sheets -- was simply too harsh. It was not the least drastic means of insuring the integrity of the initiative process. The court found that respondents failed to demonstrate that the state's interest in integrity could not be served by the less drastic penalty of disqualification of signatures of those from jurisdictions other than that of the circulatory penalty provision, which disqualified an entire sheet of 24 proper and valid signatures solely because the twenty-fifth was improper. The court held that such a penalty was a constitutionally impermissible limitation upon Ill. Const. art. XIV's right of initiative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner state's petitions for leave to file original petitions for writs of mandamus in three consolidated cases. Respondent judges had held unconstitutional &sect; 5-12 of the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 705-12 (1979) and denied the state's petitions to proceed thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that given the absence of a constitutional requirement that a trial by jury be afforded in all juvenile proceedings, the Legislature had afforded sufficient recognition to the right by allowing a trial by jury when the individual was prosecuted as an habitual juvenile offender. The court held that the Juvenile Court Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para 701-1 et seq., was not constitutionally flawed simply because it did not require that trial by jury have been afforded at the two predicate adjudications. The court also rejected the judges' contention that the Act violated due process because it allowed the question of a prior adjudication to be tried by the court rather than a jury. The court held that there was no merit to the judges' argument that the individual may have been prejudiced by the impeachment usage of prior adjudications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of mandamus, which directed the judges to vacate their orders, which declared a section of the Juvenile Court Act unconstitutional and denied the state's petitions to proceed under that section.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which ruled that raises for defendants, members of the Cook County Board (board) were valid. Another judge of the same court dismissed petitions for mandamus brought by board members, ruling that the board's action violated &sect; 38 the Counties Act and the board president's partial line item vetoes of the raises was lawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their reelection, incumbent members of the board passed salary increases for themselves. The president of the board exercised a partial line item veto, which reduced, but did not eliminate the raises. A taxpayer challenged the board's action, and the board members brought writs of mandamus to compel the president to pay the raises the board had authorized. The circuit court dismissed the taxpayer's challenge, but another circuit court judge dismissed the petitions for the writs. The three actions were consolidated for appeal. The court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's challenge and reversed the dismissal of the petitions for writs of mandamus. The court concluded that the board members did not mislead the public during their campaigns for office, and the board's action was an effort to set an appropriate level of compensation. The court held that Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(b) (1970) did not prohibit the actions taken by the board. The court also found that the president's line item vetoes were void, but this was not an appropriate case in which to decide if a president had the power to make line item vetoes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and remanded the judgment that dismissed the taxpayer's challenge to the raises the board members voted for themselves after their reelection but before the start of the new term.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The examiner was not licensed to perform detection-of deception tests under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 202-1et seq. (1975) (Act). The examiner used a psychological stress evaluator that measured the human voice. The appellate court ruled that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2403 (1979), was special legislation in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970). Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2403 (1979) required every examiner to use a device that measured cardiovascular and respiratory changes (i.e., a polygraph machine). The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the Act did require at least use a cardiovascular and respiratory machine and use of its results. As to special legislation, doubt as to the reliability of detection-of-deception devices allowed the state to set minimum standards and prefer one method to the exclusion of others. The Act did not give licensed examiners control over entry into the trade. The Act allowed any person to obtain an internship license by paying a fee. There was no evidence that instruction by licensed examiners was unavailable. The Act allowed judicial review of the Department of Registration and Education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator filed a wrongful death action against respondent physician. He later filed a first amended complaint naming additional respondents, physicians and hospital, as respondents in discovery pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 21.1 (Supp. 1976). The additional respondents filed motions to dismiss, which were granted. The estate representative filed a second amended complaint that the trial court dismissed on grounds that it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to wrongful death actions. The appellate court affirmed. The administrator further appealed. The court on review affirmed the appellate court's ruling, concluding that the administrator's reliance on &sect; 21.1 failed, as &sect; 21.1 did not apply to his original action because it was commenced on November 10, 1975, which was prior to the effective date of &sect; 21.1, or September 19, 1976. Even if &sect; 21.1 were applicable, the administrator failed to name the physicians and hospital as parties defendant until July 7, 1977, after the six-month extension granted by &sect; 21.1 to the original two-year limitations period had expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, convicted for unlawful use of weapons, appealed from a determination of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held that the statutory requirement that a presentence investigation be conducted and a report be submitted in all felony cases pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-3-1 (1979) (amendment effective February 1, 1978) constituted an unconstitutional encroachment on the judiciary's sentencing power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants, as well as the state, waived the presentence investigation and they conducted a sentencing hearing immediately after the defendants were found guilty. The parties had not agreed on any specific sentences in connection with defendants' guilty pleas. The trial judge then, sua sponte, held Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-3-1 (1979) unconstitutional, contending that a presentence report which could not be waived was an invasion of the sentencing powers of the judiciary and also an invasion of executive authority. Defendants argued that they did not have the option of waiving the reports and that the judge could not accept their waivers. The state argued that the statute did not prevent a waiver of the reports by defendants. The court reversed the sentences and remanded, holding that the section did not constitute an unconstitutional encroachment. The court also found that the presumption that the legislature intended to change the law by deleting the provision permitting defendants to waive the presentence investigation report was not rebutted and the presentence report requirement by its language was not only mandatory, but also could not be waived by defendants.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed the death sentence. Defendant was not entitled to a defense to the murder charge or a voluntary manslaughter instruction based upon compulsion, based upon the legislature's intent. However, the court vacated defendant's death sentence. Given that defendant had no criminal history, that he had a follower personality, that he was an alcoholic, that he was not the ringleader of the crimes, and that he had potential for rehabilitation, the death penalty was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from orders of the Appellate Court for the Fourth District (Illinois) reducing defendants' sentences. The State contended that the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-4.1 (1979), unconstitutionally conflicted with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b)(4), by modifying the standard of review of sentences and authorizing appellate courts to impose any sentence the trial court could have imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck down para. 1005-5-4.1 as unconstitutional. The statute was in direct conflict with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b)(4), 73 Ill. 2d R. 615(b)(4), and sought to modify the standard of review for sentences and authorized appellate courts to impose any sentence that a trial court could have imposed. Under Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 the judicial power was vested in the state courts. Judicial power was not defined in the constitution, but all such power was exclusively and exhaustively granted to the courts. If the power was judicial in character, it necessarily followed that the legislature was expressly prohibited from exercising it. It was equally clear that the state supreme court possessed the rulemaking authority to regulate the trial of cases and the authority to regulate appeals. Although it was true that the legislature had the power to enact laws governing judicial practice where it did not unduly infringe upon the inherent powers of the judiciary, where a rule of the state supreme court on a matter within the court's authority and a statute on the same subject conflicted, the rule prevailed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders affirming the trial court's reduction of defendants' sentences were reversed because the statute altering the standard of review for sentences and authorizing appellate courts to impose any sentence that a trial court could have imposed unconstitutionally infringed on the power of the state supreme court to regulate matters of appellate practice and procedure.</SPAN></P>

The deceased owned an undivided one-third interest in minerals beneath the surface area. When she died, such rights were transferred to the oil and gas owners under her will. The oil and gas owners failed to file written notices in the recorder's office or to preserve their ownership in any other way. Subsequently, it was discovered that commercial quantities of oil underlayed a portion of the tract of land. The property owner refused to pay the oil and gas owners any of the oil proceeds. He argued that his refusal to pay them was supported by the Dormant Mineral Interests Act (the Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 30, para. 197, 198 (1975), because their failure to preserve their ownership constituted statutory abandonment of their rights. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that oil and gas owners' severed mineral interests constituted protected property interests that were entitled to procedural due process safeguards. The court further held that the Act provided no notice nor an opportunity for the oil and gas owners to be heard, and therefore unconstitutionally violated their right to due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority adopted resolutions that authorized the issuance of municipal bonds to fund the amendment to the Act in order to raise low-interest mortgage money and that directed the chairman to publish a notice of sale inviting bids.

The chairman contended that the amendment to the Act was invalid because it's wealth classification system violated equal protection standards. The circuit court declared the amendment to the Act valid and ordered the chairman to comply with the Authority's resolutions. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that such legislation based on a wealth classification infringing on a person's right to housing did not constitute a suspect classification under the equal protection clauses of either the United States Constitution or the Illinois Constitution. Thus, although the amendment to the Act may have excluded certain non-first-time home purchasers who were in greater financial need than some first-time home buyers, the classification bore a rational relationship to the legitimate legislative purpose of providing financing for housing to low- and moderate-income families.</SPAN></P>

The court suspended the attorney for nine months. The court concluded that the attorney's conduct, taken in its totality, constituted a serious professional transgression and brought the legal profession into disrepute. The court determined that the amount of money that was actually involved was enough that conduct underlying the attorney's conviction could be considered a felony even though he pleaded guilty to an information that charged a misdemeanor. The court found that the attorney's misconduct was a serious violation of important professional responsibilities that had been entrusted to him. The attorney was a lawyer of mature and sophisticated experience and pleaded guilty to what had to be considered the misapplication and conversion of the money in question for his personal benefit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been charged with knowingly, at a public place, while standing behind a storm door, exposing his sex organ in a lewd manner in violation of 38 Ill. Comp. Stat. 11/9(a)(3). The lower court had declared the statute unconstitutional. Defendant had filed a motion to dismiss the information on the ground that it violated various amendments to the United States Constitution. Defendant contended the prosecution violated his privacy rights. The court concluded the prosecution did not unconstitutionally invade defendant's right to privacy. Defendant argued the statute at issue was overbroad. The court stated it declined to allow one whose personal right of privacy had not been violated to assert the hypothetical rights of others. The court held that activities which were primarily expressive were not within the scope of the statute. Defendant contended the statutes were so vague that any prosecution under them constituted a denial of due process. The court determined this argument was meritless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the case, because defendant's constitutional rights had not been violated and he was properly convicted for violating the public indecency statute.

The employer sought certiorari from the circuit court, which confirmed the compensation, chiropractic, attorney fees and interest awards but reversed the penalties assessed. The employee appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded, ruling that there was sufficient evidence to support the compensation and chiropractor awards. However, the attorney fees, costs, and penalties awarded were not warranted because the Act did not require the employer to make payment prior to a final determination of liability where reasonable grounds for challenging the liability existed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant deposited an amount in order to secure his release from jail.

The appellate court granted the people's motion to apply the deposit to his legal services and directed the trial court to withhold the value of those services from the deposit. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 110-7(g) was invalid. The statute violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions because only defendants posting bail were obliged to reimburse the county for the cost of their appointed counsel. The court found this violated defendant's rights to equal protection because there was no rational relationship between the statute's purpose, the reimbursement for the expense of appointed counsel, and the imposition of that obligation on only one segment of the class of indigent defendants, those posting bail. The court found that the statute's presumption that posting of bail demonstrated an ability to pay for those services could not substitute for a due process hearing to determine if a defendant was indigent.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed that order on appeal and remanded the case. The court found that the relevant statutes expressed an intent to permit entries to arrest if reasonable grounds or probable cause were present, and that precedent established that factors in addition to probable cause were present in each case in which the police activity was found to be reasonable within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court also held that a warrantless entry to arrest required exigent circumstances. In addition to exigent circumstances, the officers' entry fell within the spirit of the hot-pursuit exception, that there was no deliberate or unjustified delay during which time a warrant could have been obtained, and that the officers acted on a clear showing of probable cause that was based on the type of reasonably trustworthy information that justified warrantless law enforcement activities.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 704.03(e) (1979), which allowed the imposition of an occupation tax on persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property, was constitutional. The court ruled that although Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 9, 10 required municipalities to tax property uniformly within their jurisdictions, no such limitation applied to nonproperty taxes. The only limitation on occupation, privilege, and franchise taxes was that under &sect; 1 they had to be uniform as to the class upon which they operated. The court held that the RTA could create different classes within its jurisdiction for the purpose of imposing a nonproperty tax. The court ruled that pursuant to &sect; 8, the legislature authorized the RTA to use the classification and to impose the tax involved in the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen brought an action against defendants after his name failed to appear on the ballot when a nonpartisan primary was held.

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b) (1977), was found to be unconstitutional and void as a violation of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 402(b) of the Act imposed a greater penalty for possession of schedule IV controlled substances than that imposed by &sect; 401(e) for delivery. The state contended that the penalty established for violations of &sect; 402(b) did not deprive defendants of equal protection because all who were found guilty were equally subject to the penalty. The court held that &sect; 402(b) did not violate equal protection, but did violate the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution and was invalid. The court reversed the dismissals of the charges for schedule II and III substances and affirmed the dismissals for possession of schedule IV substances. Inasmuch as &sect; 402(b), as it was applied to charges of possession of schedule IV substances, was not reasonably designed to remedy the evil which the legislature determined to be a greater threat to the public, which was delivery, it was violative of the due process clause. The penalties for delivery of schedule II and III controlled substances were either greater than or equal to the penalty imposed for possession of those substances. Consequently, those provisions were not contrary to the purposes of &sect; 100 of the Act and did not offend due process.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of all three crimes. The court affirmed the convictions. The court found that defendant waived his right to assert many of the alleged errors by failing to object at the trial court level. Defendant failed to demonstrate that actual incompetence of his appointed counsel resulted in prejudice to him. Defendant was not denied a fair trial because the jury was chosen from a venire that excluded persons who could not impose the death penalty. Failure of the trial court to give the jury instruction defining &quot;recklessly&quot; in conjunction with the involuntary manslaughter instruction was not in error because defendant failed to tender the instruction to the trial court and the trial court was not required to sua sponte give the instruction. The court vacated the death sentence imposed for the murder of the police officer. The three crimes were all part of one unfortunate and tragic event and the trial court failed to consider as mitigating factors the absence of any prior criminal activity and whether defendant was under extreme mental or emotional disturbances.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that &sect; 162a of the Act was unconstitutional because it was a limitation on home rule units and an impermissible limitation of the powers to tax delegated to the village as a home rule municipality pursuant to Ill.

The court disagreed and found that the Act was enacted for promoting the public purpose of the state in reducing unemployment, relieving urban blight, and increasing the general tax base. The court determined that the portion of the Act permitting revenues collected by various taxing districts to be paid to the municipal treasurer to pay costs arising out of redevelopment was a valid public purpose and constitutional.

The companies also asserted that the regulations exceeded the power granted the board under the act, and that the regulations violated equal protection rights. The appellate court upheld the rules, refusing to consider the companies' constitutional objections on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction to do so. The companies appealed, the board cross-appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. Section 24 of the act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1024 (1977), was not improperly vague because what &sect; 24 proscribed was conduct that violated any regulation or standard adopted by the board. The court could not say that the legislature contemplated that each regulation had to be tailored to some common law decision on tort liability; thus the board did not exceed its powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly passed a bill that allocated funds for the purchase of drug-abuse treatment services by the DDC during fiscal year 1977. The governor reduced that line item by $ 100,000. The general assembly subsequently overrode that veto. Thereafter, the governor directed that $ 100,000 of the funds appropriated for the DDC be withheld because of budgetary concerns. The drug-rehabilitation providers commenced an action, which sought to prohibit the state officials from interfering with the amount that had been allocated for the purchase of drug-abuse treatment services. The appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal of that action. The state officials sought review of the appellate court's decision. The court reversed that decision and affirmed the trial court's judgment. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 161 (1977), the power to incur obligations ceased on June 30 of the year when the act making that appropriation was enacted. However, the authority to pay continued until the end of the next fiscal quarter. Therefore, the litigation was rendered moot on September 30, 1977, because the disputed funds had lapsed on that date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been arrested for attempted murder and rape, when detectives from a nearby county requested an interview with him in relation to a murder. After the interview, defendant requested counsel and consulted with him several times. He later asked to speak with the detectives, turning down offers to have his attorney present, and signed a rights waiver before giving a statement inculpating himself with the crime the detectives were investigating. At trial, defendant's motion to suppress the statement was denied, and he was convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the admission violated his right against self-incrimination and it was taken from him in disregard of his right to counsel. The court affirmed the conviction because the statement was made several hours after the initial interrogation, after defendant had conferred with his attorney several times, after he had been informed of his Miranda rights, and after he had expressly declined to remain silent or have counsel present. The court vacated the sentence of death and remanded for resentencing because an aggravating factor was erroneously included in the sentencing decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teachers filed an action relating to revenue in the court against respondents, Chicago School Finance Authority (the Authority) and board, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Authority and the other provisions of Ill. Pub. Act 81-1221(the Act) were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority was created by the Act, which provided for the termination of the terms of all members of the school board and the appointment of a new board. The teachers, who were employed by the board, sought a declaratory judgment that the Authority and the other provisions of the Act were invalid. The court entered a judgment for the Authority and the board. The court determined that it was intended that the power to raise revenue through taxation was firmly vested in the General Assembly both through the inherent power of that body, and by the specific grant of the Constitution. The court held that the enactment of the legislation was not an impairment of contract proscribed by either the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Illinois. The court could not say that the Act constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court found that the enrolled bill rule was clearly applicable in the teachers' case, and the court held that the legislation was properly enacted. The court further held that the Act was constitutional and became effective upon approval on January 16, 1980.</SPAN></P>
