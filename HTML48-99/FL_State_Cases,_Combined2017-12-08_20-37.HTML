<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relator filed a suggestion for the issuance of a rule nisi in prohibition against respondent to prohibit respondent from further prosecution of relator after he was charged with grand larceny by the trial court (Florida). Respondent contended that he was immunized from prosecution pursuant to the state's immunity statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 932.29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was a twenty-year city councilman, when a grand jury was convened to investigate certain business irregularities by city officials. Relator was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. After relator was brought before the grand jury, the states attorney asked if he was willing to waive his immunity; whereupon, relator executed a written waiver of immunity. Relator filed a suggestion, claiming that he was entitled to immunity pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 932.29, and that his waiver of immunity was a nullity because it was executed without benefit of the Miranda warnings. Denying the suggestion for issuance of a rule nisi, the court found that there was no contention by relator that the grand jury or its agents had in any way coerced his waiver. The court held that Miranda was applicable to interrogations in the isolated setting of the police station and not those occurring in courts or other official investigations where a court reporter and a broad representative group of citizens were present to serve as impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied relator relator's suggestion for issuance of a rule nisi because relator's waiver of immunity did not require that Miranda warnings be given because the interrogation was not in a police setting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensees owned trailer parks in appellee city. Appellants sought a declaratory judgment that an ordinance unconstitutionally levied an annual license fee of $ 10 for each trailer space. The circuit court held that appellants failed to substantiate their contentions. The circuit court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, set aside the injunction, upheld the ordinance as constitutional, and assessed fees for the license and water supplied to appellants. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed, because appellants did not meet their burden of proving that they were denied equal protection or that the fee was confiscatory, arbitrary, or discriminatory. The court found that the ordinance reasonably classified trailer parks differently than commercial living accommodations, which conducted the same general character of business by different methods. The court found that appellee explained the ordinance as an attempt to equalize the burden of its operation by levying appellants' proportionate share of ad valorem taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state beverage director challenged the decision of the lower court (Florida), which rejected his motion to dismiss appellees' suit seeking vindication of personal rights, on the ground of improper venue, arguing that the lower court erred in determining, pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state beverage director sought review of rejection of his motion to dismiss, on grounds of improper venue, appellees' suit, contending that the lower court erred in finding that appellees' suit, challenging an alleged direct infringement of their personal rights, should be brought, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.30(1), in the county of appellees' residence. On appeal, the lower court order was reversed. In support of its ruling, the court held that while ch. 120.30(1) provided the right to seek declaratory judgment as to the validity, meaning, or application of any rule of a state agency, appellees' suit addressed the interpretation and construction of a statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 561.20. The court further held that where the purpose of a proceeding was to challenge a state officer in the exercise of his statutory duties, the law was clear that the officer may invoke the right to be sued in the county of his residence. In addition, upon examination of the record, the court determined that it could find no showing of a direct infringement of the constitutional rights of appellees pursuant to ch. 561.20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial of the motion to dismiss was reversed because the court found that as the purpose of appellees' suit was the vindication of a statutorily-based personal right, challenging a state officer in the exercise of his duties, the suit was properly brought in the county of the state officer's residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Governor of the State of Florida, and other state officials constituting the State Board of Conservation of the State of Florida, sought review from the Circuit Court of Leon County (Florida). The trial court held that it was not unlawful for appellee individuals and appellee seafood corporation, under Fla. Stat. ch. 370.08(3), to possess in Florida fish that had been caught from waters outside the territorial limits of Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee individuals and appellee seafood corporation filed a complaint seeking a declaratory decree of appellees' rights under Fla. Stat. ch. 370.08(3). The trial court declared that the statute applied only to the taking of food fish within state territorial waters. The state officials, including the Governor of the State of Florida and the State Board of Conservation, appealed. The reviewing court affirmed. The statute did not clearly indicate intent to regulate conduct of Florida citizens beyond the territorial limits of the state. The statute prohibiting the taking of food fish by certain equipment was a valid exercise of the state's police power. Because the statute applied to a taking within the territorial waters of the state it did not deny to appellees the equal protection of the law nor deprive them of property without due process of law. It was not unlawful under ch. 370.08(3) to possess in Florida fish that had been caught from the waters outside the territorial limits of Florida. The Legislature failed to broaden the area of water in which ch. 370.08(3) provisions were applicable, and the court had no power or authority to broaden the same by statutory construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the declaratory judgment that appellee individuals and appellee seafood corporation would not violate the statutes at issue if they possessed in Florida fish that had been caught from the waters outside the territorial limits of Florida. The Legislature failed to broaden the area of water in which the statute applied, and there was a presumption that the statutes pertained only to the territorial jurisdiction of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff indemnitees and defendant indemnitor entered into a purported indemnity agreement in connection with defendant's sale of stock to plaintiffs. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss for improper venue. Later, the trial court struck defendant's counterclaim, alleging fraud with prejudice and portions of his amended answer and an affirmative defense. Defendant appealed these orders before a final judgment had been rendered in the case. Plaintiffs attempted to quash the appeal. The court denied motion to quash because the portion of the order that struck defendant's counterclaim involved a severable and distinct cause of action; thus, the order was final and appealable even though it did not dispose of all issues in the case. The court affirmed and held that the counterclaim was properly stricken because it failed to allege actionable damages. However, the court declined to hear appeals on the other interlocutory orders under Fla. R. App. P. 4.2. Further, the court held that the orders that struck portions of the amended answer and an affirmative defense were not a necessary step of the final order dismissing the counterclaim with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner individuals were involved in an eminent domain proceeding with respondent canal authority. The trial court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss respondent's complaint. The basis of the motion was, inter alia, that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74.051, which authorized the entry of an order or judgment based upon a declaration of taking, was unconstitutional. Petitioners sought interlocutory review by way of a petition for certiorari. The court denied the writ of certiorari. The court held that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4 fixed the jurisdiction of the supreme court and provided that appeals from trial courts could be taken directly to the supreme court, as a matter of right, from final judgments or decrees directly passing on the validity of a state statute. Pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(3), the court did not have concurrent jurisdiction. Thus, the court held that it did not possess any constitutional jurisdiction to review a final or interlocutory decree that determined the validity of a Florida statute because the supreme court had exclusive jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pensacola, Fla. Zoning Code &sect; 13 permitted launderettes and dry cleaning establishments with a caveat that dry cleaning establishments would not be permitted until January, 1970. Plaintiff residents argued that the limiting language for dry cleaners was unconstitutional because it deprived them of the right to a legal use of their property without due process. The lower court agreed; however, rather than merely deleting the limiting language, the lower court deleted the entire section leaving only the caption &quot;Launderettes&quot;. Plaintiff residents contended that this, too, was unconstitutional because it continued to deprive them of a legal use of their property. The court agreed, finding that only the unlawful part, the reference to a date for dry cleaning establishments, should have been deleted. The court found that the purpose for the limiting language did not concern the health, safety, or welfare of the residents, but was an attempt by the zoning board to address possible unfair competition to current dry cleaning establishments. The court reversed the order striking the entire ordinance stating that only the unlawful language should have been removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Pinellas County Circuit Court (Florida), which convicted defendant of larceny and admitted defendant's confession to the crime into evidence, despite an unlawful arrest and an earlier tainted statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on suspicion of auto theft, searched, and transported to the county jail. Defendant made incriminating statements during the arrest. At the county jail, a substitute charge of vagrancy was entered. While at a divider gate, defendant admitted to a trooper that the car was stolen. The trooper and a deputy then took defendant upstairs to an interrogation room and defendant confessed that the car was stolen. The trial court excluded the statements made during the arrest and those made at the divider gate. The trial court convicted defendant of larceny. Defendant appealed on grounds that the confession was improperly admitted. The court reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that the arrest was unlawful because it was not supported by probable cause. Defendant's unlawful detention, however, did not automatically render the confession inadmissible, but was only a circumstance to be considered by the court. The confession was inadmissible because it was obtained immediately after the tainted incriminating statements were made at the divider gate, and the debilitating influences of the earlier statements carried over to the subsequent interrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision that convicted defendant of larceny because defendant's confession was given shortly after an earlier tainted statement, and the debilitating influence of the earlier tainted statement rendered the confession inadmissible. The unlawful arrest did not automatically lead to the exclusion of the confession, but was a circumstance that was considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, and sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida). Petitioner was tried in the county court on an information that charged him with the crime of having passed worthless checks, under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 832.05. The jury found petitioner guilty, and he was sentenced to a term of 90 days in the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari and review of a decision which convicted him of having passed worthless checks and sentenced him to a 90 day jail term. Petitioner challenged the court's jurisdiction. Petitioner was tried in the county court. Under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 6, the circuit court had appellate jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases that arose in the county court, or before county judges' courts, and of all misdemeanors tried in criminal courts of record. A violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 832.05 was designated as a misdemeanor in the statute itself, so the circuit court had jurisdiction. Judgments rendered by a circuit court in the exercise of its final appellate jurisdiction were reviewable by district courts of appeal through the procedure of certiorari, pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 5 (3). Therefore, the court had jurisdiction to have determined whether or not the writ should have been granted. During the proceedings, petitioner contended that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. However, the statute was impliedly held to be constitutional by the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for writ of certiorari was denied, and the court held that jurisdiction was proper. The court considered each of petitioner's points on appeal, and found them without merit, and his conviction for passing worthless checks was affirmed. Additionally, the statute under which petitioner was convicted was held to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, board of public instruction and corporation, filed a complaint against defendant insurer for the balance due on a contract that defendant had insured. The trial court found that a 20-year statute of limitations applied to plaintiff's suit and that, consequently, plaintiff's suit was not time-barred. Defendant appealed that decision. The court reversed and held that, under Fla. Stat. ch. 255.05, plaintiff's action was barred under a one-year statute of limitations. The contract was breached when the statute was in full effect, but plaintiff did not bring its action until two years later, so, therefore, its claim was barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a motion to quash the subpoena served upon him, which required his appearance before the grand jury and required him to answer questions. Appellant contended that the grand jury had been selected, drawn, impaneled, and sworn contrary to law and the state and federal constitutions. He also contended that the subpoena had been issued contrary to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 932.17. The trial court denied his claims, holding that he had no standing to raise such challenges, as he was only a witness and not one being charged by the grand jury. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that specific constitutional and statutory grounds were raised, but that appellant did not have standing to argue them. Thus, the court affirmed the lower court's holding, noting that appellant had admitted his refusal to obey the lower court's order requiring him to answer the questions, which was a valid basis for the imposition of civil contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city advertised for bids on a sanitary sewer project. The lowest bid was submitted by appellee contractor, who did not possess a certificate of competency. Subsequently, appellee contractor obtained a certificate and appellant accepted its bid. Other appellees, a plumbing trust and associated others, filed suit for an emergency injunction, which the trial court granted. On appeal appellant contended that the language of an applicable ordinance contained errors rendering it meaningless; that if the certificate was a condition precedent to bidding, then it was an unreasonable restriction; and that appellant had discretion to waive the certificate. Affirming the trial court's injunction, the court ruled that the intent of the ordinance was to require, as a condition precedent to bidding, that the bidder hold a valid certificate of competency; and that this intent could be effectuated by correcting missing words and clerical errors. The ordinance was not unreasonably restrictive because it limited bidders to those who were competent. To allow appellant to permit bidders to qualify after their bids were accepted would circumvent the intent of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

On review sought by appellant, the court affirmed on the basis that ch. 63-1513 was unconstitutional. The court found that ch. 63-1513 failed to provide who was to call the referendum election or how such election was to be held and, thus, violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 21.

Appellants submitted to a search of some of the contents of the automobile, were advised that they were under arrest for &quot;investigation of larceny,&quot; and were taken to the sheriff's office. Appellants denied ownership of the car and claimed that they did not have the key to the trunk. The rear seat of the automobile was pulled back revealing merchandise taken from the store. Appellants moved to suppress the merchandise in the trunk on the ground that the arrest, search, and seizure were made without warrants or consent. In affirming the trial judge, the court ruled that the officers had probable cause to arrest appellants without a warrant based on the description of the automobile and its occupants. The court also ruled that the search of the trunk was incidental to the arrest and was not too remote in time or place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city levied a millage based on a tax assessment roll prepared by appellee county. The trial court entered a judgment that declared that appellant's millage was excessive, and that the millage violated Fla. Stat. ch. 193.03, which limited the amount of the millage. Appellant sought review. The court held the comptroller of Florida was not a necessary party to the suit under Fla. Stat. ch. 196.14 because the suit did not involve the cancellation or validity of a tax assessment. Further, Fla. Stat. ch. 193.03 did not violate equal protection principles by excluding school districts from its effect because the classification was not arbitrary or capricious. Appellant was not exempted from Fla. Stat. ch. 193.03(5) because the statute applied to all millage levied on the basis of one county tax assessor's roll. The court concluded that appellant failed to establish Fla. Stat. ch. 193.03 was in conflict with the Florida constitution, and affirmed the final decree entered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a zoning ordinance enacted by appellant city in 1930, the area where appellee's property was located was zoned &quot;RC,&quot; which was classified as an estate district. It had consisted of luxurious waterfront homes located in one of the most desirable residential sections. The construction and location of a terminus of the causeway led to the eradication of the waterfront residential area in which appellee's property was located. All of the surrounding homes were removed, the waterfront was filled in and access roads to the causeway were placed around appellee's property. The chancellor made several findings in favor of appellee which appellant challenged. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to substantiate the findings and order of the trial court. Appellant also claimed that appellee property owner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it was required to appeal to the board of adjustment. The court rejected this argument because that board had no authority to effectuate a change of zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the chancellor's ruling that the continued enforcement of the zoning was unreasonable, unconstitutional, and void because the land was no longer suitable or useful for residential purposes. The court held that this finding was based on sufficient evidence for the lower court to have made its order.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that plaintiffs should have brought an action to enjoin the enforcement of the Special Act under which defendant's gained a license with which to operate their business. The court found that equity jurisdiction must be properly invoked in order to sustain enjoining the enforcement of a statute, and that plaintiffs would need to show more than general allegation of irreparable injury.

Stat. chs. 768.01 and 768.02, for the recovery of damages for the death of her husband as a result of a motor vehicle-train collision. The case was tried on the issues of denial of negligence on the part of appellant railroad and the presence of negligence on the part of appellee's decedent as the sole proximate cause of, or as a proximate contributing cause of, the accident and death. The jury entered a verdict in favor of appellee. On appeal, the railroad assigned five points of error: (1) the court erred in denying objections to the qualifications and competency of appellee's expert witnesses; (2) the court erred in admitting evidence showing operational failures of the automatic signaling devices at the crossing in question; (3) the court erred in denying appellant's challenge for cause of prospective juror; (4) the court erred in denying appellant's motion for mistrial; and (5) the court erred in charging the jury on the comparative negligence statute.

The trial court found that plaintiff was not protected under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 695.01 (1963) because he did not pay valuable consideration for the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchaser challenged the trial court's order in favor of defendant heirs that dismissed his action to quiet title in a certain property and to set aside certain deeds to the property. Plaintiff asserted that he paid valuable consideration and recorded prior to defendants. The court affirmed and found that plaintiff listed consideration in his brief but failed to attach any evidence of the consideration for the court's review.. The court noted that defendants' brief contained a mention of consideration in the amount of $ 100. The court noted that failure to pay consideration denied plaintiff protection of his after-acquired title under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 695.01 (1963). The court held that defendants obtained title to the property upon the death of their father, and their mother merely had a life estate in the property. The court noted that prior conveyances between defendants and their mother did not estop defendants from challenging plaintiff's after-acquired title because both defendants and their mother knew that the mother retained a life estate in the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December 1959, a county school board entered into a contract with a principal contractor to construct a school building and the principal contractor provided a surety bond issued by defendant surety. Plaintiff, materialman to the principal contractor, furnished materials for the job until December 1960. Plaintiff was not paid by the principal contractor and filed an action against it in January 1961. A final judgment was entered against the principal contractor in January 1964. Plaintiff filed an action against defendant in June 1964 to recover against the surety, and defendant claimed the matter was barred by the one year statute of limitations set forth in Fla.

Based upon its holding that the one year statute did not apply, the court reversed the summary judgment entered by the lower court. The court indicated that defendant might be able to amend its answer in further proceedings to assert that the three year statute of limitations under Fla.

Finally, the trial court permitted the display of several incriminating items that were never introduced into evidence. The court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that there was evidence that the victim's statement was made with rational deliberateness and therefore was inadmissible hearsay that could not be rescued by res gestae.

Finally, displaying exhibits that were not entered as evidence violated the defendant's right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a husband and wife, appealed the judgment from the trial court (Florida) awarding plaintiff creditor the unpaid balance on a promissory note executed by defendants in the name of defendant corporation. Defendants asserted that they executed the promissory note as accommodation makers and it was not their intent to incur personal liability as makers through accommodation or otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a husband and wife, executed a promissory note in the name of defendant corporation, but alleged that there was no consideration therefor and that they had executed the same as accommodation makers. The trial court, finding that plaintiff creditor proved her claim and that defendants failed to sustain their defenses, entered judgment against defendant corporation and defendants. The court affirmed. The court held that there was no confusion as to the capacity in which defendants signed the note. It was signed first on behalf of the corporation, and then by each defendant separately, with the word &quot;individually&quot; typewritten after each of their signatures. Defendants stood equally as the principal makers. Therefore, defendants were clearly liable as accommodation makers on the note. The court also held that defendants' argument that Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1 gave defendant wife immunity from judgment was meritless because the judgment against defendant wife was not primarily to pay the debts of her husband, but to pay the debts of defendant corporation, in which her husband was interested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment holding defendants, a husband and wife, liable as accommodation makers on the note that defendant corporation was the primary obligor. The court held that because defendants had the same legal status as guarantors, defendant wife was not immune from judgment on defendant corporation's debt, in which her husband was interested.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the ordinance was valid and remanded, holding that the part of the ordinance imposing a license tax on the use of trucks was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 320.24 made it unlawful for any city to collect a license or registration fee on any motor driven vehicle in the state.

Appellee had obtained the declaratory decree after his conviction for violating the code. The court affirmed the finding of unconstitutionality as to one particular section of the code because it delegated complete discretion to the city clerk to grant or deny licenses without supplying any standards to be followed. The court reversed the lower court on the remainder of the issues, and held that the code had been enacted under the authority of the city charter and was an acceptable exercise of police power as a means of protection of the public from false advertising and deception. Further, the court held that these types of regulations made to protect the public from fraud could not be nullified unless they were unreasonable and arbitrary or grossly unjust and oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner and defendant county tax assessor appealed a decree regarding a tax assessment. Plaintiff alleged that defendant had assessed plaintiff's property for ad valorem tax purposes arbitrarily and with unconscionable discrimination. The chancellor found that defendant had failed to utilize established appraisal principles but that plaintiff's property had not been over-assessed. The appellate court held that in arriving at a just valuation, assessors should utilize a method that conforms to the constitutional and statutory requirements regarding proper valuation and assessment, thereby taking into consideration the following seven factors: present cash value of property, its present use, its location, size or quantity, cost of property and present replacement value of improvements, condition of property, and income it yielded. Plaintiff had the right to have his assessment reduced to the value at which others were taxed. Where it was impossible to secure both the standards of the true value, and the uniformity and equality required by law, the latter requirement was preferred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board contracted for the construction of a school. Appellant supplier brought suit against appellees contractor and surety on a performance bond. The trial court entered summary final judgment for appellees, and appellants sought review. The court reversed, finding that the trial court erred in basing its judgment on failure to notify as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 255.05. The court found that because the legislature had failed to reenact and publish ch. 255.05 as required by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, ch. 255.05 was unconstitutional until 1963 Fla. Laws ch. 63-437 was enacted. Thus, the court found that at the time appellant supplier furnished the materials to the subcontractor and at the time it commenced its suit, the notice requirement had no force or effect. Since the court found that the performance bond obligated appellees to make payments promptly but contained no notice requirements, and the statutory notice requirements of ch. 255.05 were not in effect, appellant supplier was not precluded from bringing an action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county school board adopted a resolution establishing a total school millage of 8.5 mills, which increased the school board budget by 47 percent, after the county tax assessor had imposed on appellant a ratio that, by law, would allow only 6.85 mills. Appellee state sought a writ of mandamus directing appellant to reduce its millage to the legal maximum permitted. The circuit court's final judgment held that appellant's assessed mills was excessive and illegal under the law, but denied the peremptory writ. On appeal, the court held that Fla. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10 did not prohibit the state legislature from requiring appellant to reduce the tax levy as approved by the voters. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.03, which capped the maximum mills, was not in conflict with the state constitution and that appellant had exceeded the constitutional maximum without the taxpayer's approval. However, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment because granting the writ at that point in time would result in greater harm and confusion to the public than relief to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's denial of a peremptory writ because, although appellant school board exceeded its authority in authorizing mills in excess of the constitutional maximum, the injury to the public in reversing the action would be greater than the individual right of appellee state to obtain the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant rental unit owners filed an action against appellee City of St. Petersburg to have a municipal ordinance declared unconstitutional. The ordinance, City of St. Petersburg, Fla., Ordinance 44-E (1964), required that rental units be equipped with permanent heating equipment. Appellant argued the ordinance was unconstitutional because it excepted owner-occupied units, was unreasonable, and violated the constitutional guarantee against the impairment of contracts. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Appellant sought interlocutory relief. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the ordinance was constitutional. The court held that the exception of owner-occupied units was not discriminatory because there was a reasonable distinction between the fire hazards in rental units versus the hazards in owner-occupied units. The ordinance did not go further than required to accomplish its purpose. The ordinance was proper because its reasonableness was fairly debatable. The ordinance was constitutional and reasonable, therefore, it was not objectionable if it incidentally impaired the obligations of private contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband filed wrongful death actions against defendant railroad companies for the death of plaintiff's wife and daughter in a collision with a train at a railroad crossing. Defendants denied negligence and asserted the defense of contributory negligence. The trial resulted in a verdict of $ 185,000 for the wife's death and $ 40,000 for the daughter's death. Defendants sought review. The court affirmed the verdict, but ordered a remittitur of $ 25,000 for the wife's death. The court held that testimony by an expert witness on the wife's value was competent and did not invade the jury's province. A newspaper article about the expert witness had no prejudicial effect on the jury. It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a jury instruction regarding the fact that the award was not subject to taxation. There was no error in the denial of defendants' motion to amend to include a contributory negligence defense to the child's death. The award was not so excessive as to indicate passion, bias, or prejudice by the jury. A remittitur was required on the wife's damages because it was unclear if the wife rendered the clerical services to plaintiff or a corporation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that even if the licensing of appellant could be classified as a regulation imposed to promote health, welfare, safety, and morals, it was still necessary that the exactions be fixed in the ordinance with such certainty that the granting and denial of a license could not be left to the whim of a private property owner or an administrative agency. The court reversed and concluded that the ordinance was void for indefiniteness and because it constituted an unauthorized delegation of legislative power by appellee.</SPAN></P>

The chancellor held that the provisions of ch. 59-216 were inapplicable as a basis for fixing appellant's compensation. The chancellor found that appellant's compensation for the years 1959 and 1960 was controlled by ch. 145. The court held that appellant was entitled to the benefits of Fla. Stat. ch. 59-216, the 1959 amendment to the sheriff's salary act, insofar as his right to compensation for 1959. Under the terms of this act, he was entitled to be paid an amount equal to the compensation he received as sheriff for 1958, which was the sum of $ 6,000.00. Appellant's salary for 1960 was relegated to the provisions of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a general contractor's employee, was injured when a bucket of mortar was dropped on his head by defendant subcontractor's employee. Plaintiff opted to file suit against defendant subcontractor and its employee, and did not file a claim for workmen's compensation benefits against the general contractor. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.10 required the general contractor to provide workers' coverage for its own employees and its subcontractors' employees who were not otherwise covered, and deemed the general contractor's and defendant subcontractor's employees to be employed in one and the same business. Recognizing that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11 provided that the general contractor and defendant subcontractor's liability as set forth in ch. 440.10 was exclusive, the court held that plaintiff could not sue defendant subcontractor for the negligence of its employee, and affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the case against defendant subcontractor.</SPAN></P>

Appellee lessees maintained a business of more than five years standing on the property. The jury awarded compensation to lessees. When appellant's motion for a new trial was denied, it appealed. The court adopted the opinion issued by the trial court in denying the motion for new trial. Under both the federal and state constitutions, appellant could not take private property for public use without just compensation. Appellees, as lessees for a term of years, had an interest in the land. Under the law of eminent domain, they were entitled to share in the compensation when the property was taken during the period of their lease. Since appellees were entitled to receive just compensation, it was necessary to allow the jury to consider evidence as to damages. Although there was error in the jury instructions as to the proper measure of damages, that they should determine fair market value, not actual value, the prejudice was to appellees, who did not appeal, and the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court initially noted the subject statute had been determined to be unconstitutional by the state supreme court in a decision entered subsequent to the final judgment in the instant case. The appellate court then found that it had jurisdiction to dispose of a case according to the law prevailing at the time of the appellate disposition, and not according to the law prevailing at the time of the final judgment's rendition. Nevertheless, the appellate court affirmed, finding that the constitutionality issue was not a proper basis for reversal where appellant had failed to preserve the issue by alleging error at the trial level.</SPAN></P>

Appellant then sought review of an order denying his petition for certiorari for review of the suspension of his license by appellee. The court affirmed and held that the words used by the legislature requiring off-street parking for each unit meant that the off-street parking had to be located on or adjacent to the premises of the motel establishment and that this construction of the statute by appellee was both reasonable and proper. The court held that even though the statutory phrase &quot;recognized as a motel in the community in which it is situated and by the industry&quot; failed to set forth appropriate standards for determination of what was necessary for a building establishment to qualify as a motel, they did not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying appellant business operator's petition for certiorari for review of the suspension of his license by appellee hotel and restaurant commission was affirmed because construction of the statute by appellee hotel and restaurant commission requiring off-street parking for each unit was reasonable and proper, and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, upon appellee's motion, dismissed the cause with prejudice. The court reversed and held that notice was not required because appellant's cause of action was alleged as a breach of the contract of carriage, not of tort, which would have required notice. The court also held that appellant, as a paying passenger on the bus, had the right to sue in contract for the breach of the contract of carriage.

Plaintiff contended that payment of a license tax was in direct conflict with the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151, and in violation of plaintiff's rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution and the Florida Constitution. On appeal, the court agreed that the complaint of appellant did not justify issuance of the relief sought. Labor unions, in general, performed an active and important function in the carrying on of many trades and occupations.

Stat. ch. 212.55, as applied to sales of tangible personal property falling within the purview and intent of the Import-Export Clause. The court reversed summary judgment to appellee in part for equipment which was not installed, and remanded because the transaction was not sale on the open market which would have subjected it to sales tax. The court affirmed summary judgment to appellee in part because it agreed with the trial court that the sale of the electronic equipment installed on aircraft in Florida constituted an intrastate delivery of merchandise which was subject in all respects to state taxation, and was entirely disassociated from the exporting process involving the aircraft as a completed unit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that plaintiff's cause of action was controlled by Fla. Stat. ch. 337.18, and hence was not barred. On appeal the court affirmed summary judgment for plaintiff. The court concluded that the trial court's conclusion as to the statute of limitations was correct, but noted that a provision attempting to amend Fla. Stat. ch. 225.05(2) had been struck down as unconstitutional. Therefore the applicable statute of limitations was 20 years as opposed to 1 year, and plaintiff's cause of action was not barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee hospital district filed suit on a payment bond that was executed for the use and benefit of a supplier of certain materials to a sub-contractor that defaulted. Appellant contractor and surety alleged that appellee was barred from recovery because appellee failed to give written notice of the suit within the ninety-day provision in the bond which was a condition precedent. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the trial court entered judgment for appellee. Appellee asserted that the bond was repugnant to Fla. Stat. ch. 255.05, which governed the bond. Appellant argued that the statute did not prohibit including a notice provision in the bond. The court reversed the trial court and determined that the bond contained a one-year limitation period for filing suit that was invalid because it attempted to shorten the statute of limitations. However, the court determined that a surety could impose a condition of notice on a payment and performance bond because a notice provision does not limit the time in which a suit can be brought.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that a complaint for specific performance was not to be dismissed if, by any reasonable construction of the pleadings, a case was stated that would have entitled appellant to equitable relief. The appellate court also rejected the jurisdictional and venue challenges under the motion to dismiss, finding that the proceeding was quasi in rem and operated only upon the property or some interest contained on the land. The appellate court then determined that the dismissal was not warranted for appellee buyer's failure to join as defendants the beneficiaries of the trust managed by appellant. The appellate court affirmed, finding that the beneficiaries were not indispensable parties that should have been joined to the proceeding on the specific performance complaint where the land trust deed in question fully empowered appellant to deal with the land without the joinder of beneficiaries under the trust agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The freeholders of the City of Orlando passed a bond issue to build a theatre and convention hall. It appeared that most people were under the impression that the facility would be located in a city park, however, there was nothing official concerning the location. After the bond issue passed, a group of citizens started a campaign to have the building located in downtown Orlando. This group submitted a petition, signed by the requisite number of voters, to have an ordinance passed stating that this facility would be located downtown. In the initiative election, the voters passed the ordinance providing that the building would be located downtown. Appellant then brought suit challenging the validity of the proceeding. He was unsuccessful in the lower court. On appeal, the court concluded that because city officials had the right to change the location of the facility, the people of the City of Orlando, voting in an initiative election, had the same right. All of the qualified voters had a right to participate in the designation of the place and the city was not estopped from passing the ordinance. The lower court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was involved in a car accident in one county and sued appellants in another county. Appellants filed a motion to dismiss or transfer the case to the county in which the accident occurred on the ground that venue was improperly laid in the county in which appellee filed suit because the cause of action did not arise there. In support of that contention, appellants cited to an amendment to the venue statute, 1963 Fla. Laws ch. 63-572, which purported to amend Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46.01. Appellee asserted that the amendment to &sect; 46.01 was unconstitutional and void. The trial court held in appellee's favor and denied appellants' motion. Appellants sought the court's review. The court held that the title of ch. 63-572, which purported to remove the provisions which rendered &sect; 46.01 inapplicable to non-residents, was invalid and unconstitutional, and enacted contrary to the provisions of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, inasmuch as the subject of the statute was not adequately expressed in its title, and the subject matter dealt with more than one subject. Furthermore, it constituted the actual repeal of a rule of procedure without giving notice of such repeal. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of an attempt to commit grand larceny and appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence, over appellant's objection, a tape recording, made without his knowledge, of a telephone conversation between him and the prosecuting witness, which recording was procured before his arrest and with the prosecuting witness' consent by means of wires that were attached by a deputy sheriff to the telephone receiver used by her in communicating with appellant. The court affirmed the conviction holding that the Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 822.10 defined the unauthorized wire tapping of a telephone conversation to be a felony, and did not apply to the authorized acts performed by the deputy sheriff in this case who acted with the consent of the prosecuting witness, who had a proprietary interest in the subject telephone conversation of equal dignity to that of appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee widow was appointed curator of her husband's estate and filed a petition for probate. The will was admitted to probate and letters of administration were issued. Appellee then published notice to creditors. Appellee subsequently filed her final report, and a final judgment was entered. One year later, appellee filed an election to take dower. The trial court found the election was timely filed and awarded appellee dower with the remainder to appellant beneficiaries. Appellants sought review. The court held that the dower statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 731.35, was amended during the probate of the decedent's estate. However, the court ruled that the dower statute as it existed at the time of the death of appellee's husband was controlling. The dower statute at that time provided that appellee's election had to have been filed within nine months after the first notice to creditors. The court reversed the award of dower to appellee because her right to elect dower was controlled by the requirements of the dower statute as it existed at the time of her husband's death, and appellee's failure to elect dower within the statutory time period barred her from asserting the right.</SPAN></P>

Typically, the Florida client would execute the agreement, forward the agreement to New York, and thereafter, appellee would send it back to the client. Appellant comptroller commenced an action against appellee for the gross receipts tax in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 543.28. The trial court found that the instrument did not become a contract until executed and delivered by appellee and pursuant to the statute, because appellee did not sell or license or dispose of rights in Florida, appellee was not liable for the aforementioned tax. Appellant challenged the decision. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision. The court reasoned that the legislature did not intend for such a narrow construction of the underlying statute as applied by the trial court. The court held the statute did intend to tax appellee for the privilege of selling licenses or rights within the state and reversed accordingly.</SPAN></P>

App. R. 3.18, but appellee claimed that the 90 day statutory period was absolute and could not be waived or extended by the courts. Fla. App. R. 3.18 states that the last day of a statutory period should be counted unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. The court noted that where a rule adopted by the Florida Supreme Court concerning practice and procedure, conflicted with a statute, the rule superseded that statute. Therefore, the court determined that because the last day of the 90 day period was a Sunday, appellant did file a timely notice to appeal by filing the notice on the following Monday. Therefore, the court denied appellee's motion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that property was not exempt from ad valorem taxes because the items that were paid from the rents were not for a charitable, benevolent, or fraternal purpose. The court further held that the assessment was legal and appellant failed to follow the statutory requirements provided by Fla. Stat. ch. 196.01 to make a case that the assessment was excessive. Finally, the court held that if the trial court gave an advisory opinion, then the proceedings would not be considered to be encompassed within the provisions of the Declaratory Judgments Act.

The complaint alleged that defendant furnished, supplied, constructed and reproduced prosthetic dentures to be worn in the human mouth, and supplied artificial substitutes for the natural tooth, without the written prescription of a duly licensed or registered dentist. Defendant admitted to owning a licensed dental laboratory, but denied that he practiced dentistry. After trial on the merits, the trial court found defendant guilty and enjoined him from the further unauthorized practice of dentistry. Defendant appealed, arguing that he was entrapped by plaintiff's paid investigators. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that because plaintiff had probable cause to believe that defendant was engaged in the unauthorized practice of dentistry, it was a proper basis for the investigation that was conducted by paid investigators. Moreover, the court ruled that the investigators' testimony was properly admitted as competent evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner realtor raised three points on appeal from an order of respondent, the Florida Real Estate Commission that denied his motion to quash an information in proceedings against him. The court ruled against petitioner on two points but quashed the order on the grounds of the failure to inform petitioner of the nature of the charges against him. The court found that the information charged the petitioner with an alleged course of conduct over a period of three years without stating, with any degree of exactness, when or in what specific manner he had violated the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 475. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 475 did not abridge petitioner's constitutional right to a jury trial, as there was no right to a jury trial in an administrative hearing. The court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 475.30(1) did not violate petitioner's constitutional right against self-incrimination by requiring the filing of a sworn answer to an information because the proceedings were administrative, not criminal. The court quashed the order denying the motion filed by the petitioner, with directions to the respondent to quash the information.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a decree, which established a procedure for an election of commissioners and reinstatement of the town government. On appeal by an intervenor on behalf of appellant town, the court reversed, finding that the trial court was without equity jurisdiction to order an election, because constitutional authority to establish and to abolish municipalities was vested in the legislature and nothing in the town charter or state law specifically delegated such authority to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant justices of the peace appealed a trial court (Florida) final declaratory decree in plaintiff attorney's action that passed upon the validity of 1961 Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney claimed that 1961 Fla. Laws &sect; 3, ch. 61-648, creating small claims courts in each justice of the peace district in a county, violated the state constitution and statutory limitations upon defendant justices of the peace. The Declaratory Judgments Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 87 (1961), was designed to provide relief only to one whose immunity, power, privilege, or right was dependent upon the facts or the law applicable to the facts, especially when he sought a judicial declaration that a law was unconstitutional. Though uncertainty in the law might be of more immediate concern to an attorney than a layman, that concern did not allow plaintiff to maintain a declaratory action to resolve the uncertainty. Confusion with respect to the proper forum to litigate small claims only cast doubt upon the rights and privileges of those possessed of or liable upon such claims. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court finding that the law in question was unconstitutional and remanded with directions that plaintiff's complaint be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, plaintiff adjacent property owners challenged their complaint's dismissal on the grounds that defendant city's actions with respect to the zoning changes were invalid because the partial reduction in classification constituted an &quot;amendment&quot; that required new notice and hearing. The court rejected the argument that the notice should have listed each possible or alternative classification, noting that there had been no contention that the original petition and notice, as filed, failed to comply with the applicable city ordinance or statute. The court determined that a minor change in classification, such as a lesser change than that requested by the petitioning landowners and published in the notice of hearing, was sustainable where the modification grew out of a matter raised at a duly noticed hearing at which plaintiffs were in attendance. The court affirmed, finding that the complaint failed to aver any material violation of a substantive right where plaintiffs did not allege that they would have sustained any special or irreparable damage or harm differing in kind, rather than degree, from that inuring the community at large.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff adjacent property owner's injunctive complaint, finding that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief where they failed to allege that they suffered any prejudice with respect to any legal right in connection with a zoning reclassification, which contained a minor change that grew out of a matter raised at the hearing of which plaintiffs had received proper notice and had attended.</SPAN></P>

Appellee requested and was granted a writ of prohibition preventing his imprisonment for nonpayment of the fees. Appellant judges sought review. The court held that Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., Code &sect;&sect; 15-1 to 15-33 improperly subjected appellee to imprisonment for a debt. The court determined that the fee imposed by the code was a charge for a special service, and thus constituted a debt. As a result, Fla. Const. Declaration of Rights &sect; 16 prohibited imprisonment for appellee's failure to pay it. As the code also provided for a fine for appellee's failure to pay, it was not entirely unconstitutional. Because the writ of prohibition issued by the circuit court only enjoined the unconstitutional imprisonment penalty, it was proper. The court therefore affirmed the order granting the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an owner of a parcel of land that had one house and two separate out-buildings on it that were rented to separate tenants. When appellant's mother requested permission to make an addition to the beach house, the town counsel granted an exception to the ordinance and allowed her to erect a lake house on the west side of the highway. However, the grant of such house contained a provision that leasing out of either residence would not be separate from the other one. Subsequently, appellant, by final decree, was enjoined from leasing the out-buildings on her property as dwelling houses or from permitting more than one family to live on such property in violation of Town of Manalapan, Fla., Zoning Ordinance No 13. On appeal, the court held the zoning ordinance, although constitutional in its general application was in its specific application to appellant's property, an unconstitutional, arbitrary, and unreasonable exercise of legislative power. The court noted that appellant's property was essentially two separate non-contiguous lots facing two separate bodies of water and was divided by the highway and elevated ridge and incapable of being used as a unit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then ordered police officers to arrest plaintiff for having an improper license. Plaintiff sued defendants, the judge, prosecutor and police officers, for false arrest and imprisonment, but the trial court granted their motions to dismiss. On appeal, the court held that the officers properly obeyed defendant's order, and the prosecutor's questioning of plaintiff about his driver's license was not a civil wrong. However, there was no law requiring plaintiff to have a driver's license, and plaintiff did not commit any misdemeanor in defendant's presence. Thus, defendant exceeded his jurisdiction by ordering the arrest, and the judicial immunity which protected him from civil liability when he acted within his jurisdiction did not apply. Therefore, the court reversed the order dismissing plaintiff's claim with respect to defendant, affirmed it in all other respects, and remanded the case to reinstate the complaint against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county engineer was charged with accepting a bribe in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 838.012. An information was issued, appellee surrendered and filed a petition in habeas corpus, which was granted. State argued on appeal that the grant of habeas corpus was in error because the information alleged a crime, and appellee had waived the immunity granted under Fla. Stat. ch. 932.29. The court reversed the trial court's grant of habeas corpus. The court reasoned that even if appellee used a go-between to obtain the bribe, a crime still occurred as if appellee directly received the bribe. The court also stated that it was error for the trial court to discharge appellee on grounds of immunity because the appropriate remedy would have been to challenge jurisdiction by claiming immunity.</SPAN></P>

The products were labeled chocolate milk, chocolate milk drink, chocolate drink, buttermilk, and cultured buttermilk.

Thereafter, a judgment was entered for the balance payable on the promissory note in an action brought by appellee note holder, who had served appellants personally. The court reversed because the trial court erred when it excluded expert testimony relating to the fair market value of the mortgaged property. The court agreed that ch. 702.02(5) would have established a conclusive presumption that the value of the mortgaged property was the amount bid at the sale, if there had been personal jurisdiction over appellants. However, the only lawful force and effect of the mortgage foreclosure proceedings was that as concerned and affected the mortgaged property.

On appeal the court held that, in proper circumstances, reasonable regulations and limits upon use by a property owner of his property could be imposed through legislation in the interests of public welfare through the police power. The court affirmed the trial court's adjudication on the merits because even though title to the submerged lands had been acquired prior to passage of the acts protested the laws were constitutionally valid. The court reversed the trial court's estoppel ruling and remanded because the trial court erred in finding under the election of remedies doctrine and estoppel that appellants were barred from testing the constitutionality of general and special laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner was convicted of several felonies, and during sentencing was declared indigent. Appellant filed a motion for writ of mandamus that requested the appointment of an attorney to assist appellant with perfecting an appeal of the convictions. The court observed that equality of treatment between rich and poor alike demanded by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ought to afford an indigent, during the one and only appeal of right, an attorney to assist with the preparation of the appeal for it to have any meaning whatsoever. The only state-wide applied appointment of counsel provision was set forth in Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 909.21, but that was limited to indigents in capital cases and sentenced to death. The court found that a special law for Pinellas County, 1961 Laws of Florida ch. 61-2663, established an office of the public defender to provide an indigent charged with the commission of any triable crime representation. It also extended the public defender's duties to include appeals and writs to higher courts provided the defender reasonably expected a reversal or modification of the conviction or modification of the sentence. The court directed appointment of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant publisher sought to distribute and sell a book. Appellee state filed suit under Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 847, an obscenity statute, in order to enjoin the sale and distribution of the book. The trial court granted appellee's requested injunction and ruled that the statute was constitutional. Appellant initially argued that the trial court's ruling on the constitutionality was erroneous, but later by stipulation withdrew the argument. The court directed the parties to preliminarily argue whether it had jurisdiction over the case. The court observed that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(2) directed appeals to the Florida Supreme Court when a final judgment directly passed upon the validity of a statute. Appellant argued that the withdrawal of its argument put jurisdiction in the court, and appellee argued that the validity of the statute and the appeal were inseparable and inherent, therefore the Florida Supreme Court had jurisdiction. The court determined that it was not clear that it had jurisdiction and so under Fla. R. App. P. 2.1(a)(5), Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 31, it transferred the case to the supreme court so that it could determine which court had proper jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant county and several intervenor defendants appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that plaintiff properly alleged and proved that it had exhausted its administrative remedies.

Appellee urged that the complexity of ch. 517 made it impossible for an ordinary person to determine what acts were prohibited and punishable thereunder. Appellee further asserted that the failure of the statutes to designate knowledge or criminal intent as an element of the crime was a denial of due process rendering the statute unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment from the trial court (Florida) that determined that it was not permitted, under Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment preventing it from deducting, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.09(4), appellee former police officer's lump sum disability award from his pension benefits. The court reversed the judgment, agreeing with appellant's claim that the statute applied to both lump sum disability awards and periodic disability payments. The court ruled that appellant was permitted to make the deductions from appellee's pension payments in accordance with the statute, notwithstanding the previous lump sum payment. The court reasoned that the statute was to be interpreted so as to preserve the legislative intent, which was to prevent an employee from receiving both a pension and workmen's compensation benefits from his employer when the employer was the state, any political subdivision thereof, or a quasi-public corporation therein.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment that prohibited appellant city from deducting from appellee former police officer's pension benefits the amount of appellee's lump sum disability award. In enacting the applicable statute, the legislature intended to prevent a public employee, such as appellee, from receiving from a public employer, such as appellant, a pension as well as workmen's compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered appellant witness to travel to New York under the Uniform Law to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, Fla. Stat. ch. 942, for the express purpose of securing her testimony before a grand jury. The court affirmed the order on appeal. The court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 942.02(1) gave the circuit court jurisdiction over the matter because that statute provided for the presentation of an appropriate certificate to any judge of a court of record in the county in which appellant was located. The court also found that the certificate was valid because the judge who issued it had satisfied himself as to the sufficiency of the evidentiary facts to establish the necessary conditions for doing so, and that it was attached to an affidavit that detailed the reasons for requiring the testimony. In addition, the court determined that it was not improper for the trial judge to lend the dignity of evidence to the facts stated in appellee State of New York's properly authenticated documents even though they were not subject to cross-examination, partially because the case was not a criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employee was involved in a car accident while in the course of his employment. Appellee employer had taken out an automobile liability insurance policy with appellant insurer. Appellant sought a declaration of its rights and liabilities under the policy as to appellees, administratrix of employee's estate and employer county. Appellant denied that the policy extended coverage to the estate because the policy had an exclusionary clause in case the insured had other insurance. The trial court held that appellant's policy applied to the estate. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. It found that the exclusionary clause was an &quot;escape clause.&quot; The record showed that employee had valid and collectible insurance. As appellant's liability was not in issue, where the &quot;double insurance&quot; consisted of a policy with a no &quot;other insurance&quot; clause, and a policy with an &quot;other insurance&quot; clause, full force and effect was given to such clause.

Defendant had been found guilty of the same charge against another victim arising out of the same incident. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court could not accept a plea of nolo contendere to a capital offense. Defendant also asserted several other grounds for reversal including a double jeopardy violation. On appeal the court held that defendant's plea was valid because he escaped a possible death penalty by entering the plea on the condition that he be sentenced to life in prison. Affirming the conviction, the court held that a nolo contendere plea had the same effect as a guilty plea for purposes of the action, which resulted in a waiver of all his defenses except for the sufficiency of the indictment. The court also stated that there was no double jeopardy violation because double jeopardy applied to the offense and not to the criminal act. Defendant could be charged separately for each victim of his crime, even though the victims were injured by the same act.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the broad meaning given to the subsection, which allowed appellee to usurp the powers of all three branches of the government and that a specific grant of authority delegated by the legislature could not be based on such a vague and general provision as ch. 381.031(12).

Affirming the trial court's decision to allow the amendment, the court stated that the new rules abolished technical forms of pleading and introduced much greater liberality, so that if the amendment merely corrected a misnomer, it was not tantamount to a new cause of action. The court also rejected appellees' claim of lack of jurisdiction under Fla. Const. art.

Relator's agents participated in the formation of respondent village and dealt with respondent council in matters of zoning.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state government sought reversal of five orders of a Florida trial court, consolidated on appeal, quashing informations against appellee criminal defendants due to imprecise informations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state government challenged five orders entered by the trial court quashing its informations against appellee criminal defendants. In each case, appellant tracked the language of the relevant statute, charging each appellee with abusing his public office by failing to perform a required act, rule, or regulation. In no case, however, did appellant specify which act, rule, or regulation had not been complied with. On appeal, the orders were affirmed. The court held that although appellant had in each case tracked the language of the relevant statute, and although precedent held that tracking the statute was ordinarily sufficient, in these cases such a practice was insufficient. This was because the statutory language was generic, and here it was essential, in order to give appellees fair notice of what they were being charged with, to specify the specific act, rule, or regulation violated. Quashing the informations was therefore appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's orders were affirmed. Quashing the informations was proper because they were phrased in generic terms, and specificity was needed in order to permit appellees to defend themselves. Merely tracking the language of the relevant statute was not always enough.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners contracted for improvements. The contractor did not furnish a bond and appellants did not withhold 20 percent of the payments as Florida Mechanics' Lien Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 84.5(11)(a) (1961) required. The contractor abandoned the project without paying appellee suppliers. Appellants offered them the last payment due the contractor, an amount greater than the 20 percent they should have withheld under ch. 84.5(11)(a), and contracted with another to complete the project. After refusing appellants' offer, appellees brought suit in accordance with Fla.

Appellee sought to enjoin appellant electric cooperative from providing electricity to appellee's customers in a county where it had a nonexclusive franchise.

The Supreme Court of Florida quashed the orders. On remand, the chancellor made the TROs permanent. Appellant challenged the order, contending appellee failed to sustain the allegations of its complaints through the required proof. The court affirmed because the complaints stated a cause for relief that appellant used its preferential economic advantage to extend its service to appellee's customers, violating Fla.

Appellants argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court's finding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a final judgment from the trial court (Florida) that dismissed with prejudice appellant's petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus directed to appellee circuit court clerk. Appellant contended that 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 815 extended concurrent jurisdiction over his matter to the circuit court, or alternatively, that 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25574(13) unconstitutionally restricted the right to jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25574 established a civil claims court with jurisdiction over controversies from $ 100 to $ 500 in amount. 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25574(13) also provided that a party could have a jury trial by making a deposit in such court. 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 815 extended the jurisdiction of this court to $ 1000. Appellant tendered a complaint in circuit court for an amount of damages more than $ 500, but less than $ 1000, which appellee clerk refused to accept. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's motion for a peremptory writ of mandamus. The court held that ch. 815 did not create concurrent jurisdiction in the two courts for matters between $ 500 and $ 1000. Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 11, fixed the jurisdiction of the circuit courts, and gave them exclusive original jurisdiction in cases not cognizable by inferior courts. The effect of ch. 25574 was to divest the circuit court of jurisdiction over appellant's case. The deposit requirement of ch. 25574(13) was not constitutionally infirm. Any reasonable deposit required by the court to secure the costs of a jury trial did not impair the right of jury trial guaranteed by Fla. Const. Declaration of Rights &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed appellant's petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus. The court held that appellee circuit court clerk properly refused filing of appellant's complaint, as it did not meet the minimum jurisdictional amount in controversy. The court also held that the requirement that appellant post a deposit in civil claims court to secure a jury trial was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff land owners brought an action against defendants, tax assessor, tax collector, and board of county commissioners, seeking to enjoin collection of a 1960 assessment of agricultural lands pursuant to Fla.

Defendants appealed an adverse final decree, arguing that the lower court erred in interpreting chapter 193.11(3) as requiring an assessor to appraise agricultural lands solely on the basis of their use as agricultural lands. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court decision, holding that the construction given by the lower court would make chapter 193.11(3) to be of dubious constitutional validity because it would result in systematically lower valuations for agricultural lands when such an exception was not provided for under the Florida Constitution. The court thus reversed the final decree with directions to reinstate the 1960 assessment.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was amended to delete restaurants from the list of permissive uses. Appellee property owners bought a property within the district and requested a variance to construct a building to be used as a restaurant. The variance was denied and appellees filed suit, seeking to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional. The trial court declared the zoning ordinance unconstitutional and void as bearing no relationship to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community as a whole. Appellant challenged the decision. The court reversed the decree declaring appellant's zoning ordinance unconstitutional. The court held that the burden of proving the invalidity of an ordinance was extraordinary and heavy. The court reviewed the record and concluded that appellees did not sufficiently meet their burden of proving the ordinance's unconstitutionality. The court found that under these circumstances, a court did not have the authority to substitute its judgment for that of the municipal legislative body, which adopted the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Appellees' land was zoned for single family residential use, but appellees claimed that the best use of their land was commercial or business and that the existing zoning deprived them of the beneficial use of their land and reduced its value. Appellees claimed that appellant's ordinance was confiscatory upon appellees' land and was invalid. The trial court declared the ordinance invalid only as it attempted to limit the use of appellees' land. The trial decree directed appellant to rezone the land for commercial or business use. The court affirmed in part and held that there was nothing in the record to justify overturning the trial court's conclusion that the zoning classification of appellees' land was arbitrary and confiscatory. The court reversed the rezoning because, after determining that the property was improperly zoned, the matter should have been re-submitted to the zoning authorities to determine the proper classification of the property.</SPAN></P>

The chancellor entered a final decree dismissing the cause, stating that plaintiff was required to exhaust its administrative remedies by seeking relief from defendant's board of adjustment before applying for judicial relief.

The court found that plaintiff was not required to pursue administrative remedies before resorting to the courts, if such remedy would be of no avail, and that the board of adjustment did not have the authority to grant the relief sought. The court held that the changes plaintiff sought were so fundamental and substantial that they should be accomplished only by amending the ordinance, and not by the administrative procedure of variances or exceptions, and thus plaintiff had exhausted its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the chancellor and held that appellee was qualified to bring an action for declaratory relief because he had the right to injunctive relief to protect tax funds and had the right to declaratory relief adjudging that a disbursement already made was illegal. Appellee was not estopped from bringing the suit as an employee of the low bidder because appellee's motives as taxpayer were immaterial with regard to the clean hands doctrine. The court held that &sect; 287.081 was too vague and indefinite to establish a base upon which competitive bids may have been submitted; it rendered impossible an exact comparison of bids and allowed favoritism.

Appellant collected the rental price and remitted the amount less commission to the owners. Thereafter, appellee state comptroller filed a notice of tax assessment against appellant under the Florida Sales and Use Tax Law (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 212. Appellee based the assessment on a rule which provided that such rentals could not qualify for exemption as an occasional or isolated sale. After an administrative proceeding, appellant filed a complaint seeking a determination of the validity of the assessment and injunctive relief. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and appellant sought appellate review. The appeals court reversed. The court ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 212.02(2), which defined a lease of tangible personal property as a &quot;sale,&quot; was applicable to portions of the Act pertaining to both taxability and exemptability. Hence, appellee exceeded his authority by promulgating a rule that was contrary to the statute. The court further stated that if a lease was properly exempted, it could not be converted into a taxable transaction by the fact that it was made through a broker.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 73.14 allowed appeals of eminent domain proceedings to be filed with the Florida Supreme Court (Court), but required appeals to be filed within 30 days of final judgment. Defendant clearly filed his appeal more than 30 days after final judgment. However, the effect of an amendment to Fla. Const. art. V was to withdraw jurisdiction of the Court to review by direct appeal final judgments in eminent domain proceedings and place it with the district courts of appeal. The question before the court was whether the amendment invalidated the 30-day requirement in Fla. Stat. ch. 73.14. The court held that it did not and granted plaintiff's motion to dismiss defendant's appeal as untimely. The amendment had the effect of amending by implication that section of Fla. Stat. ch. 73.14 relating to appeals from final judgments in eminent domain proceedings by substituting the district courts for the Court. It did not invalidate the entire statute. Therefore, the 30-day requirement still governed and fit within the exception to Fla. R.

The court found that the question of appellant's legal existence was a natural and vital issue to be raised in the action and that expeditious resolution would terminate public confusion.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 836.05, appellant state filed a motion to dismiss appellee's cross-assignment of error or to remand to determine whether the trial court had passed on the constitutionality of &sect; 836.05 in denying appellee's motion to quash the second and third counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee defendant was charged with four counts relating to extortion under Fla. Sta. Ann. &sect; 836.05. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 924.07(1) appellant state sought review of the trial court order that granted appellee's motion to quash the information as to the first and fourth count. Appellee cross-assigned error as to the denial of his motion regarding the second and third counts. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss appellee's cross-appeal, or in the alternative to remand to the trial court to specify whether the constitutionality of &sect; 836.05 was specifically passed upon in denying appellee's motion to quash the second and third counts. Appellant claimed that &sect; 924.07(1) did not contain any provision permitting appellee to cross-appeal. The court denied appellant's motion to dismiss appellee's cross-appeal, holding that appellee did have the right to maintain his cross-appeal since it related to the same order from which appellant state's appeal was taken. The court granted appellant's motion to remand because the trial court order did not specify the particular grounds it considered and did not indicate whether the constitutionality of &sect; 836.05 had been considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied appellant state's motion to dismiss appellee defendant's cross-appeal, but granted appellant's motion to remand, temporarily relinquishing jurisdiction and remanding to the trial court for the entry of an amended order on appellee's motion to quash the information, with directions that the order specify whether the court directly passed upon the constitutionality of the extortion statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Individual plaintiff challenged an order of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of defendant city in an action by plaintiff alleging assault and battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, and malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was arrested without a warrant and convicted of committing an assault on the two police officers who arrested him. Plaintiff's appeal resulted in reversal of the conviction on the ground that he was arrested without lawful authority and that he was entitled to use force as was necessary in resisting the arrest. Thereafter, plaintiff filed the instant suit against defendant city, employer of the police officers, for assault and battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, and malicious prosecution. Defendant denied liability and asserted that the claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations. Defendant then moved for summary judgment, which was granted. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the cause of action did not accrue until a final determination of the falsity of the acts complained of by the court. The court held that judgment rendered in the criminal action was not admissible to establish the facts alleged, and that the lower court was correct in applying the one-year statute of limitations. It affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant city was affirmed because plaintiff's cause of action arose when the incident complained of occurred, and not when the criminal court pronounced on the illegality of plaintiff's arrest. Therefore, the court held that the one-year statute of limitations barred the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foreign corporation challenged the decision of a Florida trial court, which dismissed with prejudice plaintiff's complaint against defendant tax officials for a decree relieving plaintiff of a personal property tax assessment against plaintiff's tangible personal property, and to enjoin defendants from collecting or attempting to collect any such tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foreign corporation brought an action alleging that plaintiff's personal property were imports within the meaning of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2, which prohibited state or local tax on imports or exports, and so defendant tax officials' tangible personal property tax assessment was unconstitutional. Defendants brought a motion to dismiss on grounds that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action, failed to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 613.01, and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On the sole issue raised on appeal the court reversed, holding that ch. 613.01, which mandated that a foreign corporation comply with certain requirements before it was authorized to transact business in Florida, did not preclude a foreign corporation that had not complied with the statute from seeking adjudication of its rights in Florida courts, which rights it acquired under the United States Constitution or laws in interstate traffic. The court thus found that the trial court had committed reversible error in dismissing the complaint due to plaintiff's noncompliance with ch. 613.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal with prejudice of plaintiff foreign corporation's action alleging that defendant tax officials imposed an unconstitutional tax on plaintiff's personal property. A statute that set out requirements that had to be met before a foreign corporation was authorized to transact business in Florida did not have to be satisfied in order for a foreign corporation to seek adjudication of its rights in Florida court.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court, however, remanded with directions that appellant could amend the complaint to allege that the property was within the municipal boundaries. Appellant amended the complaint. Appellee again filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. Appellant again sought review. The court reversed the trial court and ruled in favor of appellant because Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01(2) was constitutional. The court held that it had jurisdiction to rule on the validity of a statute. The court held that ch. 704.01(2) was constitutional because it served a public purpose and provided a lawful means to accomplish the full utilization of the state's natural resources. Considerations of public policy fully justified a means of access to landlocked property. Compensation was provided to the servient tenement, unlike the common law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Florida lower court that found that, although Fla. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee operated a self-serve laundry facility with washers and dryers activated by insertion of a coin into a slot. Other self-serve laundry facilities activated the machine manually after the coin was inserted. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 205.53 allowed appellant to collect a license tax on vending machines. Appellant contended the tax applied to appellee's coin operated laundry machines. The trial court found that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 205.53 was constitutional on its face, but was applied in an unconstitutional and discriminatory manner. The trial court enjoined appellant from collecting the license tax from appellee and others similarly situated. Appellant sought review. The court noted that the lower court found the tax was discriminatory because it was only applied to some coin operated laundry businesses. The court held that the tax imposed by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 205.53 was constitutional. The court reversed because the statute clearly allowed a license tax on machine actuated by a coin deposit that performed a service of value. The tax could be imposed on appellee's laundry machines, even though no taxes were imposed on manual machines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court that found appellee laundry owner could not be assessed a license tax because that tax was applied in a discriminatory manner, was reversed because appellee's machines were automatic and clearly fell within the statute that allowed a license tax on machines actuated by a coin deposit, even though other laundry machines did not fall within the scope of the license tax.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court disagreed and upheld their convictions. It was for the trier of fact to determine the credibility of the witnesses. Respondents were properly arrested under Fla.

The trial court entered a final decree holding illegal and void, as against appellee, the license tax paid under protest. Appellant municipal corporation challenged that decree. On appeal, the court vacated the decree and dismissed the complaint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee passenger filed suit against appellant foreign corporation in Duval County where appellant had designated a resident agent. Appellant challenged the trial court order that denied its motion to dismiss for improper venue or, in the alternative, to transfer the cause of action to another county in Florida. Appellant claimed that venue was improper because Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;46.04 provided a broader venue for suits against foreign corporations than against domestic corporations in violation of the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court held that &sect; 46.04 made only one distinction between domestic and foreign corporations that was based on real and substantial grounds, and that there had been no showing of discrimination or a denial of equal protection. Appellant also claimed that the case should have been transferred to the county where the accident occurred pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 53.17. The court held that appellee had the election of venue under the venue statute, &sect; 46.04, and if that election was properly exercised then venue was proper. The court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellee protested but the zoning director failed to deliver the promised remedial action. Appellee then filed suit to have the zoning classification as applied to its property declared arbitrary. Appellants contended that appellee failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it did not petition the Board of Adjustment to have its property excepted from the restrictions pursuant to Fla. Laws. ch. 29131, &sect; 4. The court agreed with appellants and reversed and remanded the trial court's decision declaring the zoning of appellee's land arbitrary. Appellee only challenged the ordinance as it applied to its property. Appellee did not attack the validity of the ordinance as a whole. Therefore, it was required to pursue all administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial relief, including applying to the Board of Adjustment for relief. Appellee's contention that the Board of Adjustment would be without power to grant a variance because it would constitute a rezoning of the property was erroneous.

The trial court's action could not be construed as a declaratory judgment action because there was no dispute between the parties as to a present justiciable question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that granted an injunction to appellee oyster harvesters because the agency had no statutory authority to extend the coverage of a statute from natural oyster bars to cultivated oysters in leased bottoms. The court reversed the trial court's determination of the constitutionality of the imposition of a closed season for taking oysters from leased beds because there was no bona fide dispute between the parties.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, contending that under the facts as applied to its charter, Fla. Laws ch. 57-1322 (1957), permitted the passage of the ordinance by a simple majority vote. The court reversed the final decree because the zoning ordinance was not sufficiently protested to have required the affirmative vote of four of the five commissioners. The court stated that because there was less than 50 percent protest from any one of the three areas designated by the charter provision, the zoning ordinance became effective upon the simple majority vote.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a peremptory writ authorizing appellee to make the requested inspection. Appellant claimed that action should be reversed, as ch. 608.39 was unconstitutional; the subject was res judicata; the trial court improperly interpreted the statute; the evidence precluded issuance of the writ; and certain evidence was improperly excluded. The court affirmed the trial court's issuance of the writ. The trial court properly rejected the defense of res judicata raised by appellant. Further, the other points on appeal lacked merit. The trial judge correctly exercised his discretion in holding that appellee was entitled to the mandatory writ under ch. 608.39, which granted stockholders the right to inspect stock records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, entered in the Circuit Court for Union County (Florida), asserting that the statute under which he was convicted of committing lewd and lascivious acts against a minor was unconstitutional and that the disposition of the counts against him were inconsistent. Appellees filed a cross-appeal, asserting that the trial court's holdings were in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with committing various crimes, all on the same date, relating to acts of a sexual nature he committed against a minor. A jury acquitted appellant of an assault count, but convicted him of committing a lewd and lascivious act in the presence of the minor, as well as of unlawfully fondling the minor in a lewd and lascivious manner. Appellant received a 20-year sentence of imprisonment for each conviction. He filed an unsuccessful petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court affirmed the denial of the writ, holding that the titles of Fla. Stat. chs. 801.02, 801.03 (1957) were adequate to comply with Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, and that the statutes were constitutional under that section although they did not reenact and publish at length the sections of the statutes they allegedly amended. The court reversed the portions of the lower order adverse to these holdings. The court also ordered appellees to deliver appellant to the court of his conviction for a determination of whether he was punished for two phases of the same crime, holding that it could not resolve this issue on the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant comptroller, through the attorney general, had petitioned for a writ of mandamus in the name of the state against the appellee city. The writ sought to require payment of a gross receipts tax on natural gas sold by the city to its inhabitants during a one year period, and levied by the appellant pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 203.01 as evidenced by his recorded warrant. Appellee city had refused to pay the tax imposed on the ground that it was exempt under the provisions of a special act of the legislature. The case ended up before the state supreme court who transferred it to the appeals court for determination of the constitutionality of the special act claimed by appellee city as its basis for exemption from the gross receipts tax. The court held that appellant comptroller, as a constitutional officer charged with the duty to protect the public funds, was legally entitled to question the constitutionality of the special act which purported to exempt the appellant city from the payment of gross receipts tax. The court reversed the court order appealed from and remanded the case back for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The special act exception was deemed a sound principle of law.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ of certiorari and quashed the circuit court's judgment. The court noted that the circuit court's decision did not state the grounds for declaring the ordinance unconstitutional, but that the apparent reason was that the conduct was not adequately defined so as to comply with &sect; 11.

The court held that appellant's annual leave rules became a part of the employment contract appellant was authorized to make and accrual of leave under the rule was a part of the compensation earned by appellant, as the services were being rendered, although it was not to be paid until severance of the employment contract.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county residents sued defendant city seeking an injunction and damages for the pumping of water from its well field located in another county. The trial court treated the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction as though it were a motion for improper venue. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss concluding that the charter provisions of the City of St. Petersburg stated that it may sue and be sued and be impleaded in all the courts of this State and in all matters whatsoever. Defendant appealed. The court held that the language used in the charter of St. Petersburg did not express, either directly or indirectly, any intention on the part of the legislature to change the common law in regard to actions against municipalities. Under the common law no action could be brought against a municipal corporation outside the county where it was situated, unless an express statute authorized it to be sued elsewhere. The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss concluding that the majority of the courts have held that actions against municipal corporations are inherently local and that they must be sued in the county in which they are located.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants principal and surety on supersedeas bond challenged the decision of the trial court (Florida), which dismissed their declaratory action against appellee commission related to a workmen's compensation claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were principal and surety, respectively, on a supersedeas bond filed in the course of a workmen's compensation matter before appellee commission. Certain costs and fees were charged against them on the bond by a final order of a deputy commissioner, from which no appeal was taken. Instead, appellants filed a complaint for declaratory decree against appellee, seeking review of the final order of the deputy commissioner. After the trial court found there was a jurisdictional impediment under Fla. Stat. ch. 87, which governed such declaratory actions, the court affirmed. Appellant's suit was an improper attempt to review and avoid the effects of certain features of an order of the deputy commissioner. Appellee, while administrative, was quasi-judicial in nature. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.25(4)(a), appellants were required to appeal the deputy commissioner's action to appellee rather than seek a declaratory ruling from a court. Thus, the action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of appellant's declaratory action against appellee commission, as appellants failed to comply with statutory provisions for challenging then disputed administrative ruling on worker's compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, the State Road Department, brought condemnation proceedings to acquire property owned by respondent property owners for road right-of-way purposes. The court-appointed appraisers valued the property and the order of taking fixed double that amount as the deposit required of relators. Thereafter, the trial court ordered that the clerk of the court pay respondent property owners the amount of the court appraisal, together with attorney's fees, and reserving the issue of ultimate just compensation for determination by the jury. Relators sought a writ of prohibition. The court granted the writ, holding that the trial judge exceeded his authority in fixing the amount of the disbursement to respondent property owners for just compensation on the basis of a court appraisal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of prohibition, holding that the trial court was not permitted to adopt the valuation fixed by the court appraisers as the basis for the exercise of its discretionary power to determine what part of the money deposited with the court should be paid to the persons entitled to just compensation that was ultimately to be ascertained and adjudged to be payable in the condemnation proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent yacht club was a social organization which owned a clubhouse, swimming pools, and docks. Relator club member was injured while attending a function held on respondent's property. Relator sued respondent and secured a judgment for damages. After a hearing by its administrative board, respondent expelled relator from its membership. The trial court granted a writ of mandamus requiring respondent to reinstate relator's membership. The court below quashed the writ. The court held that, in losing his membership with respondent, relator was not deprived of a property right without due process of law. The court held that whether a member's conduct was likely to endanger the welfare of a social club was for the club membership to determine and that, absent allegations of fraud or bad faith, actions of the members or their duly constituted board would not be reviewed by the courts. The court found that there were no such allegations by relator. Therefore, the court affirmed the order of the court below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners filed a complaint to quiet title in certain real property. Appellee Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida, Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted, and appellants challenged the ruling. The reviewing court granted certiorari and quashed the order dismissing the complaint with directions to reinstate appellee trustees as defendants in said cause and for further proceedings. The court found that the complaint sufficiently alleged enough facts to overcome a motion to dismiss. The allegations of the complaint were to be taken as true. The complaint was not a suit for injunction in the guise of a suit to quiet title but presented a genuine, legitimate, and proper case determinable only by the circuit court of the county in which the land in dispute was located. The court found that the litigation was correctly brought in that county and that appellee trustees were lawfully named therein as defendants. The dismissal of appellee trustees from the suit could not be justified under any rationale.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance requiring qualifying examinations, Naples Ordinance No. 284 &sect; 10A-12(d), was void as containing an unconstitutional and, therefore, fatal delegation of legislative power. Section 10A-12(d) gave unrestrained authority to the Board of Examiners since it was given the power to grant licenses arbitrarily by requiring different types of examinations for different applicants; the ordinance established no standard, lacked definite rules and conditions, and left the granting or denial of a license wholly within the uncontrolled discretion of the board.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought judicial review, and after the circuit court affirmed respondent's order, petitioner applied for a writ of certiorari. The writ of certiorari was quashed and the circuit court order was affirmed, as respondent had sufficient evidence before him to conclude that petitioner had contracted to purchase fruit from the grower and to further determine the amount due to the grower under the contract. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 601.64(4), respondent was vested with the authority to order petitioner to pay the sum of money due and owing and, upon petitioner's failure to do so, to order that petitioner's license would be revoked.</SPAN></P>
