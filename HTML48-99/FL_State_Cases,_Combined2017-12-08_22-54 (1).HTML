</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida) that dismissed their action against appellee hospital and appellee blood bank. Appellants argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1989) did not bar the action or was unconstitutional and that a blood bank was not a health care provider under ch. 95.11(4)(b), and that it could have discovery of the identities of blood donors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants' decedent discovered he had received a transfusion of blood contaminated with HIV more than four years after the transfusion, and before he became symptomatic of AIDS. Nevertheless, the court affirmed the judgment dismissing the action as to appellant hospital. The court held that the four-year statute of repose for medical malpractice actions against healthcare providers contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1989) was not repugnant to the access to courts provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. But the court reversed the judgment as to appellee blood bank, noting that blood banks were not healthcare providers, as they did not render diagnosis, treatment, or care. The court also held that the trial court correctly refused to permit appellants' request for discovery of the identities of the individuals who could have donated the contaminated blood, noting that it was in the public interest to discourage any serious disincentive to volunteer blood donation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the four-year statute of repose barred appellant's claims against appellee hospital. The statute did not bar the claims against appellee blood bank, however, because a blood bank was not a healthcare provider covered by the statute of repose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a final judgment from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) that dismissed appellant's action for contribution from appellee. Dismissal was based upon the trial court's conclusion that, at the time appellant settled with the injured party, appellee was immune from liability to pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1) (Supp. 1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found liable for personal injuries suffered by appellee's employee. Between the time of the injury and the time appellant settled with the employee, Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1) (Supp. 1990) was amended to provide that officers of a corporation had immunity for injuries to their employees occasioned by gross negligence or lesser culpability. After appellant settled with the employee, it brought this action against appellee, an officer of the employee's company, alleging that appellee's common gross negligence entitled appellant to contribution. Holding that ch. 440.11(1) provided appellee with immunity from third-party tortfeasors like appellant, the court affirmed the judgment of dismissal. The court held that ch. 440.11(1) operated prospectively. The court concluded that ch. 440.11(1) barred appellant's suit because under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, specifically Fla. Stat. ch. 768.31(2)(a), (b) (Supp. 1990), appellant's cause of action had not accrued until it had paid more than its pro rata share of the liability by settling with the employee for the full amount of the judgment, which occurred after ch. 440.11(1) was amended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed appellant's action for contribution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant board challenged a final order of the Division of Administrative Hearings (Florida), which held invalid two proposed rules promulgated by appellant. Appellee hygienist association also challenged the holding that appellant had the authority to validly approve schools or colleges by rule, rather than by order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant board promulgated two proposed rules, which established criteria for approval of a dental hygiene school and approved a specific program as an accredited school. A hearing officer held that the proposed rules were invalid, and that appellant had the authority to approve schools by rule. Both appellant and appellee hygienist association challenged the holdings. The court first resolved the issue as to whether appellee had standing to challenge the proposed rules. Pursuant to Fla. Admin Code Ann. r. 120.54(4), the individual members of appellee were substantially affected persons; therefore, appellee had standing as the representative of its members. Having found that appellee had standing, the court affirmed without discussion the holding that appellant had the authority to approve schools by rule. The court also affirmed the holding that the proposed rules were invalid because the rules constituted an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority and did not meet the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 466.007(2)(b) (1989). The Legislature restricted appellant, in approving dental hygiene schools, to either accredited schools or comparable unaccredited schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his sentence as a habitual offender from the Circuit Court for Bay County (Florida). Appellant asserted that he was sentenced under the version of the habitual offender statute, 1989 Fla. Laws. Ch. 89-280, that was declared unconstitutional and that he could not have been sentenced as a habitual offender under prior version of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Laws. Ch. 89-280, that was declared unconstitutional. Appellant had prior felony convictions in four other states, but none in Florida. The court explained that sentences imposed on those individuals sentenced under the unconstitutional version of the statute must be reversed unless they could have been sentenced as habitual offenders under the previous statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (Supp. 1988). Noting that the previous statute required a prior conviction in Florida, the court reversed appellant's sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court certified the question previously certified as to whether the amendments were unconstitutional prior to their reenactment as part of the Florida Statutes because they were in violation of the single-subject rule of the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced as an habitual violent felony offender under the state habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1991). On appeal he argued for reversal on grounds that the trial court failed to make the specific findings required by Fla. Stat. chs. 775.084(1)(b) and 775.084(3)(d) before classifying him as an habitual violent felony offender. Appellant also contended that ch. 775.084(1)(b) was unconstitutional on equal protection, due process, and double jeopardy grounds, because it increased his punishment due to the nature of a prior offense. The court noted that the constitutionality of 775.084(1)(b) had already been upheld by the state supreme court. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing, however, because the trial court had failed to make the required findings under ch. 775.084 that appellant's prior conviction had been neither pardoned nor set aside. At resentencing, the court held, the trial court again could sentence appellant as an habitual violent felony offender, provided the requisite statutory findings were made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a father, had a brief, physical relationship with appellee, a mother, who told him of her resulting pregnancy. Appellant denied paternity when appellee made a formal demand through counsel for child support after the child's birth. Nine years after the child was born, appellee filed a parentage action, appellant admitted paternity, and the trial court entered a judgment of paternity ordering appellant to pay past child support from the date of the child's birth until the date of final judgment and future support thereafter. On appeal, the court held that because the welfare of the child was paramount, because appellant knew about the child before she was born and that the child could be his, and because child support proceedings were equitable in nature, appellee's claim for past support was not barred by laches or any statute of limitations including Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(k) (1991). Because appellant had the same absolute duty to provide reasonable support to his illegitimate child as he had to a legitimate child, appellee did not need to provide evidence of the amount of past support she paid. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of paternity ordering appellant, a father, to pay past child support from his child's date of birth nine years before the parentage action was filed, because appellant's knowledge of his child existence and the equitable nature of the proceedings precluded the defenses of laches and statute of limitations, and appellant had a duty to support his child regardless of the amount of support paid by appellee, a mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of an order from the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida), which denied appellant's claim for death benefits for the death of her brother in a work-related accident based on the age restriction in Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(5), as applied to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16(1)(b)(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(5), as applied to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16, mandated that an employer of an employee killed in a work-related accident pay compensation to the sister of the deceased on account of dependency. A sister for purposes of the statutes could be no older than 22 years of age. Appellant was the sister of an employee killed in a work-related accident and was 31 years old. Appellant claimed Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(5), as applied to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16, was unconstitutional because it denied her access to court and violated her equal protection and due process rights. The court affirmed the denial of appellant's claim for death benefits for the death of her brother. The right to bring a lawsuit for damages for death by wrongful act did not exist at common law, and it therefore existed only by virtue of statute and could be taken away by the legislature. The Florida Supreme Court had previously rejected similar attacks on the constitutionality of other section of Fla. Stat. ch. 440. Appellant did not meet her burden of showing Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(5) was unconstitutional under the rationale of those cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's claim for workers' compensation death benefits based on the statutory age restriction, finding that the legislature had the right to take away lawsuits for damages for death by wrongful act because such a suit did not exist at common law and only existed by virtue of a statute. Appellant's equal protection and due process constitutional attacks on the age restriction were without merit.</SPAN></P>

Appellant further contended that the statute violated equal protection because its distance classification was not rationally related to any legitimate objective and that it violated due process protections because it did not require proof that appellant had knowledge of his proximity to the prohibited area. Appellant also argued that the statute was an invalid exercise of the police power because it had no conceivable purpose of benefit to the general public.

On appeal, the court determined that the restrictive conditions for filing suit in circuit court to contest the validity of a tax assessment contained in ch. 72.011(3) were reasonable and not violative of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court concluded that the circuit court erred in finding ch. 72.011(3) unconstitutional. Appellee had not satisfied any of the requirements of ch. 72.011(3) and did not attempt to obtain a written waiver from the director or file a motion for a court-approved security arrangement. Accordingly, the court reversed the final judgment and the case was remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Appellees failed to show any direct and specific injury with a continuing present adverse effect.

This appeal followed. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's suit. Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11 immunized appellees from tort liability for decedent's injuries other than those inflicted by an intentional tort. After considering all reasonable inferences from the allegations in the complaint in favor of appellant, the court concluded that appellant had failed to allege ultimate facts stating a cause of action against appellees for intentional tort.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prosecution charged appellee with a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 856.015. In part, ch. 856.015 criminalized an adult's failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the possession or consumption of an alcoholic beverage or drug by a minor at the adult's residence. In response to the charge by information, appellee filed a motion to dismiss, arguing ch. 856.015 was invalid on its face. The trial court found several definitions contained in ch. 856.015 were unconstitutionally vague and granted appellee's motion. Consequently, appellant sought review, contending appellee lacked standing to argue that ch. 856.015 was unconstitutional because appellee did not contend that he took any steps to prevent the consumption of alcohol. The court rejected that contention, and affirmed, because the requirement that one control the behavior of minors by taking reasonable steps to prevent them from consuming or possessing alcohol or controlled substances was too vague to be enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order that granted appellee's motion to dismiss and that declared the statute under which appellee was prosecuted as unconstitutionally vague because the statutory requirement for an adult to control the behavior of minors by taking reasonable steps to prevent them from consuming or possessing alcohol or controlled substances was too vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant condominium association sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which entered a final summary declaratory judgment and permanent injunction in favor of appellee condominium owners, after it determined that appellant's budgeting method was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower court's judgment. Appellant condominium association was organized to operate and manage three condominiums. When appellant consolidated the financial operations for the three separate condominiums, appellee condominium owners filed a complaint alleging that under statute, appellant was required to keep separate accounting records for each condominium, because the filing of individual declarations created each condominium. The court held that appellant was not required to keep separate records for common expenses born by the complex as a whole under Fla. Admin. Code 7D-23.004, which only required expenses specific to a condominium to be kept in a separate budget. Further, the use of a specific allocation formula, with respect to complex wide expenses, was found by the court to be contrary to the condominium documents. Finally, to the extent that the lower court's order required the segregation of funds between the separate condominiums, the court found it to be erroneous. As such, the court reversed and remanded the order to the lower court to clarify its order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court, Sarasota County (Florida), which denied his motion pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(g) to correct his sentence for armed burglary and sexual battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of armed burglary and sexual battery and sentenced to concurrent life sentences with the guideline recommendations. Defendant asserted three errors which he contended required reduction of his sentence. The first contention concerned the addition of 40 scoresheet points for victim injury. The court found the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the remaining total points justified a guideline life sentence. Defendant claimed that points for a prior conviction for rape were unscorable because rape was a capital felony. The court found that defendant was technically correct, but determined that scoresheet errors based on calculations of prior record, because they involve disputed fact, required a contemporaneous objection and could not be raised for the first time on appeal under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.888(a). Finally, the court determined that defendant's last contention concerning the computation of his prior record was insufficient to bring the presumptive sentence below the life threshold. Therefore, the court affirmed defendant's conviction holding that error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a judgment that denied defendant's motion to correct his sentence for armed burglary and sexual battery. The court held that even if objectionable scoresheet points were deducted, the deductions were insufficient to bring the scoresheet totals below the life threshold and, therefore, error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee passenger sued appellants, successors in interest, under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 688, and general maritime law for personal injuries he sustained aboard ship. Before trial, mediation was ordered. Appellants filed a motion seeking enforcement of an oral settlement agreement they alleged was reached during mediation. The mediator filed a motion to quash the subpoena appellants served to have the mediator to testify at a hearing on their motion. The trial court granted the motion to quash. Appellee obtained a substantial verdict at trial, then unsuccessfully sought attorneys fees. Appellee sought review of the attorney's fees denial while appellant contended error in not having an evidentiary hearing on their motion. The court held that state procedural and evidentiary rules applied to Jones Act actions; therefore, application of a mediation privilege was proper. The court reversed as to the denial of attorney's fees to appellee because state laws regarding attorney's fees made pursuant offers of judgment were not in conflict with federal admiralty law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state charged appellee fishermen with unlawfully fishing for shad in a river in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 370.11(3)(a). Appellees filed identical motions to dismiss the charges, contending that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court granted the motions. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded and found that the statute was not so vague that persons with common intelligence would have to guess and the meaning of the terms contained in the statute. The court also determined that the failure to define the terms &quot;fishing&quot; and &quot;shad&quot; did not render the statute unconstitutional because each term had a definite meaning in the fishing industry. Further, the failure of the state department of natural resources to implement a closure period for fishing did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the court found that the statute was not overbroad. The case was remanded for proceedings consistent herewith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Final orders that declared a statute regulating shad fishing unconstitutionally vague were reversed and remanded because the general terms used in the statute could be understood by the application of common understanding and ordinary logic, because undefined terms had specific meaning in the fishing industry, and because the failure of a state agency to implement a closure period did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Florida Supreme Court (Court) held that Fla. Stat. ch. 732.803 (Act) was unconstitutional because the legislature lacked the power to deprive a testator of his constitutional right to devise his property. The lower court held that the Court's decision was not retroactive and even if it was appellants were estopped to object because of waiver. The court reversed and remanded the lower court's dismissal of appellants' challenge to appellee's attempt to void their father's bequest by means of the Act. The Act was void ab initio because it was invalid based on lack of power. Appellees therefore lacked authority to revoke the bequest. Appellees' notice had no legal effect, which meant appellants' failure to promptly contest it could not be considered a waiver. The Court's decision finding the Act unconstitutional was retroactive. A statute invalidated based on power could not have interim validity based on equitable principles. If the legislature had no power to deprive a testator of his constitutional right, neither did a court by means of declaring an unconstitutional statute prospective.</SPAN></P>

That decision was retroactive and denied appellees' right to void the bequest.</SPAN></P>

The fact that defendant's sentences as a habitual felony offender were the result of a plea bargain did not preclude him from contesting the legality of the sentences. Finally, the court found that because defendant's prior record did not satisfy the statutory criteria for sentencing as a habitual felon, he could not, through a plea bargain, confer upon the trial court the authority to impose an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order sentencing defendant as a habitual felony offender was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing because defendant did not meet the threshold requirement of having two or more felony convictions in the state. Accordingly, the State's motion to dismiss the appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee finding that the appellant lacked standing to bring the action. The court reversed that decision. The state legislature authorized appellant, pursuant to Fla.

Appellants also argued that the tax certificates were unenforceable because appellee tax collector accepted a good faith payment of ad valorem property taxes from another managing entity.

The court affirmed and held that the lower court should have stricken the claim as untimely when there was no motion for enlargement of time. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that appellant was not a known or reasonably ascertainable creditor of the estate, and therefore specific notice to appellant was not required.

Appellant contended that it was improper to reclassify these offenses under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.085(1)(1991), because the statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. This section reclassified and enhanced the criminal penalties for any felony or misdemeanor if the commission of such felony or misdemeanor evidenced prejudice based on the race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or national origin of the victim. The court concluded that the law was unconstitutionally void for vagueness because it did not define with sufficient due process particularity what additional criminal act was required in order to reclassify and thus enhance the punishment of a felony or misdemeanor. It was not clear whether the statutory element of evidence of a particular type of prejudice toward the victim of the crime was a mere suggestion or something of more substantial import; and, if the latter, it was unclear what the exact nature of that import might have to be.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 228.091(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state sought an adjudication of delinquency against respondent juvenile when respondent was found at the public high school by a deputy sheriff after being previously warned to leave in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 228.0914(2). The court reversed the circuit court order that granted respondent's motion to dismiss the delinquency petition. The petition stated that respondent entered or remained after a deputy sheriff directed respondent to leave the property, and respondent failed to argue that he could not adequately prepare his defense or that he would be subjected to unfair surprise. This statement sufficiently apprised respondent of the charges against him, satisfying Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.140(o). Further, precedent established that ch. 228.091(2) was not unconstitutionally vague on its face, even though the statute set no time limit on the school official's authority to order a person off of public school property. This indicated that an information or indictment would not be fatally deficient for failing to allege the specific date when the warning to leave was issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant annuity purchaser challenged the dismissal by the Pasco County Circuit Court (Florida) of his complaint against appellee agent and appellee insurance company on the grounds that it was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his complaint, appellant annuity purchaser alleged that appellee agent represented the sale of annuities as single premium annuities and told appellant to ignore any other bills. Appellant claimed not to have known that these statements were fraudulent until more than four years later, when he received a letter from appellee insurance company, although the policies he held disclosed the actual provisions. The trial court dismissed with prejudice the counts based on fraud and misrepresentation as barred by the statute of limitations under Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2). On appeal, the court held that fraudulent concealment tolled the running of a statute of limitations when the fraud perpetrated upon the injured party placed him in ignorance of his right to sue. If the allegations of the complaint were taken as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss, a question remained concerning the date upon which appellant knew of the fraud. He was not, as a matter of law, charged with knowledge of the fraudulent acts on the date he signed the policies. Because the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss, the court reversed the dismissal and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, married homeowners, began construction of a swimming pool, stem wall, and dock on their subdivision lot. Appellant, a homeowners association, sought to enjoin appellees' construction by alleging that it violated applicable deed restrictions. Appellees opposed that action by arguing that appellant lacked standing because it was neither a legal successor to the subdivision developer nor owned property in the subdivision. The circuit court agreed and dismissed appellant's action. Appellant challenged that decision. The court reviewed relevant precedent and the facts. The court determined that appellant's articles of incorporation did not provide it with express authority to enforce them on behalf of its association. The court ruled that neither state precedent, statute, nor rules applied favorably for appellant's position. Therefore, the court affirmed the order of dismissal because appellant lacked standing. The court certified this legal question to the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant broker challenged an order rendered by appellee, the Florida Department of Banking and Finance, Division of Securities and Investor Protection, in which appellant was held liable, through an informal hearing, for violating Fla. Stat. ch. 517.12 by executing trades on appellee company's stock and receiving commissions without being registered to conduct such transactions. The court affirmed and reversed in part the order. The court rejected appellant's claim that the hearing was unconstitutional on due process grounds. The court ruled that because appellant did not timely object to the duly appointed hearing officer, there was no error in the officer's appointment. The court then rejected appellant's claim that his right to counsel was improperly denied, ruling that although he initially appeared with counsel after appellee department filed its complaint, appellant voluntarily proceeded pro se in the informal hearing requested by him. However, because the order appealed from found appellant liable for more unlawful transactions than the evidence and record supported, the cause was remanded for correction of appellant's fine.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellee summary judgment. The court reversed and remanded holding that the language of Fla. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence pursuant to a jury verdict, which found him guilty of grand theft of a motor vehicle. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction on flight over his timely objection, contrary to binding precedent that disapproved of a jury instruction on flight. The case law cited by appellant was rendered seven months after the trial court gave the complained of jury instructions. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a violent felony offender since an amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989) had been declared unconstitutional. Holding that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction on flight, the appellate court reversed the conviction and sentence. The appellate court determined that appellant, having properly objected to the flight instruction, had preserved the issue for appellate review.

As a result of appellee's action, appellant was terminated from her employment. Appellant alleged that the Adult Protective Services Act (the Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 415.101 - 415.113 (1989), was unconstitutional because the procedural order involved accusation, investigation, and conviction and imposition of penalty prior to a trial on the matter.

The question of the constitutionality of the Act was rendered moot by amendments to the Act that eliminated the employment termination provisions.

Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal contending that plaintiff state failed to prove that a firearm was used.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, sellers and a county, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee revenue department in appellants' action challenging appellant sellers' liability for a documentary stamp tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sellers agreed to sell appellant county land under the threat of condemnation and eminent domain proceedings. Neither party to the transaction paid documentary stamp taxes, but appellant county contractually agreed to pay all taxes. Appellee revenue department then notified appellant sellers that they were required to pay a documentary stamp tax. Appellants initiated a declaratory action challenging their tax liability. Appellant sellers contended the assessment would result in an indirect tax on appellant county. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of appellants. If appellant sellers were forced to pay the assessment, it would result in an indirect tax levied on appellant county, which was a tax-immune body. Under the parties' agreement, appellant county would be forced to pay the tax if it was assessed against appellant sellers.</SPAN></P>

Appellee could not assess the documentary stamp tax against appellant sellers because such assessment would result in an indirect tax against appellant county, which was a tax-immune body.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the petition for writ of certiorari, quashed the order which denied the variance, and remanded because the trial court departed from the essential requirements of law in denying certiorari review.

The appellate court reversed the habitual felony offender sentence for lack of sequential convictions and certified the question to the supreme court, declined to consider issues two and three as moot, and affirmed the fourth issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review from an order of the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida), which denied appellant's claim for recalculation of wage loss benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Judge of Compensation Claims denied appellant's claim for recalculation of wage loss benefits. On appeal, the court stated that the facts were not in dispute, only the application of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b), as amended on July 1, 1990. The problem arose from the fact that the insurance carrier calculated the wage loss benefits at $ 284.40, using the recently amended Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b), which changed the formula from 95 percent of the difference between 80 percent of the average weekly wage (AWW) and any post-maximum medical improvement (MMI) earnings, to 80 percent of the difference between 80 percent of the AWW and post-MMI earnings. Considering all of the factors, the court held that the substantive rights of the parties were fixed as of the time of injury. Therefore, the court held that the applicable law in effect at the time of the accident was Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b), as amended by 1990 Fla. Laws. ch. 90-201, and affirmed the order of the judge. However, the court certified two questions to the state supreme court as a matter of great public importance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida), that sentenced him for conviction of battery under the hate crime statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.085, contending the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of battery, a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 784.03(1)(a), and was sentenced under the enhancement provisions of the hate crime law, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.085. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the hate crime statute and the court affirmed his conviction, finding the statute constitutional. The court determined that the statute was neither vague nor overbroad, finding that it required that the commission of the crime evidenced prejudice and that prejudice exhibited during the commission of the crime itself was not sufficient. The court found that the statute did not violate appellant's free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, concluding that the statute did not punish appellant's intolerant opinions, but only his action based on his opinion that resulted in the injury to another. The court determined that the act of choosing a victim for his crime based on race, religion, or any other category specified in the statute, was speech that was subject to regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the sentence of appellant defendant for his conviction of battery under the hate crime statute, finding the statute was neither vague and overbroad nor punishment for the expression of opinion. The court determined that the statute did not punish appellant for his opinion, but, rather, for his actions based on his opinion that caused injury to another.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, a Japanese citizen, invoked its diversity jurisdiction and removed the suit to federal court. The federal court found that it had no diversity jurisdiction and remanded the case to the trial court. The trial court issued a final order granting defendant's motion to dismiss on grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing or clarification of the dismissal order. Plaintiff appealed and the court affirmed holding that under the circumstances, defendant could not have reasonably anticipated being brought into a Florida court, and thus the dismissal on grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, insured policyholders employers, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which held that they were liable for the medical coverage of their employees who had obtained health insurance through appellants, with an insurance company that had become bankrupt. Appellants claimed that they were fraudulently induced into signing with the bankrupt insurance company, and therefore was not liable for coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants employers obtained medical coverage through an insurance company for their employees. The insurance company became insolvent due to their fraud, and refused to pay the claims of the employees. Appellees, various health providers and the Florida Department of Insurance, sued appellants for the medical bills, and the trial court found in appellees favor. Appellants challenged the ruling, arguing that they were not liable for the coverage, because they had dutifully obtained insurance in good faith, were fraudulently induced into obtaining coverage with the insolvent company, and that at most, they were merely liable only for the premiums, but not full coverage. The court held that under general equitable principles, if two innocent parties were injured by a third, either through fraud or negligence, the one who made the loss possible, must bear legal responsibility. The court determined that in this instance, the lower court failed to determine the factual elements necessary to support its ruling that appellants were liable, and remanded. The court upheld the lower court's ruling that appellants could not avoid coverage by lack of notice, or due process violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the order from the County Court for Indian River County (Florida) that convicted him of driving under the influence (DUI) under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 (1989), and imposed probation under Fla. Stat. ch. 948.03 (1991) that required him to place a DUI ad in a newspaper. Appellant claimed that the ad violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, V, VIII, IX, and XIV, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 9, 17, and 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant drove his car into the rear of a sheriff's patrol car. As a result, he was convicted upon his nolo contendere plea of driving under the influence (DUI) in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 (1989). The trial court sentenced him to 12 months' probation, and, as a condition of his probation, required appellant to place and pay for a DUI ad that included appellant's photograph with a notation that he had been convicted of DUI. The trial court certified the question of whether the ad violated appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, V, VII, IX, XIV and/or Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 9, 17, 23. The court held that because probation included punitive as well as rehabilitative aspects, and because the DUI ad was reasonably related to appellant's conviction and had a deterrent effect by making the conviction unpleasant, the DUI ad was permitted under Fla. Stat. ch. 948.03(1), (2), (5), and (6) (1991). Because the DUI ad was a valid probation condition, its limitations on appellant's constitutional rights were permissible. Therefore, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order that required appellant to place a driving under the influence (DUI) ad in a newspaper as a condition of his probation after his DUI conviction, because the ad was valid under the probation statute because it was reasonably related to appellant's conviction and its punitive aspect was likely to deter future DUI violations. Thus, any abridgment of appellant's federal or state constitutional rights was permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer sought review of decision from the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida), which ordered appellant to pay appellee claimant retroactive workers' compensation benefits and a penalty pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.20 (1985). Appellant also questioned in what manner the Barragan offset of combined workers' compensation and disability retirement pension benefits in excess of appellee's average monthly wages was to be accomplished.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee claimant was injured in a compensable accident and eventually received permanent total disability (PTD) benefits. As soon as appellee became eligible for PTD, his disability retirement pension (pension) benefits also became effective. At that time, appellant employer offset appellee's PTD benefit against his pension benefits. The total benefits paid to appellee failed to meet his average monthly wage prior to the accident. After the state supreme court in Barragan ruled that such an offset was impermissible except to the extent that the offset did not cause a claimant's benefits to drop below his average monthly wage, appellant discontinued the offset. However, appellant refused to give retroactive effect to Barragan and instead challenged the retroactive application thereof. The court found no reason to depart from the supreme court's ruling that Barragan was to be applied retroactively. Furthermore, the penalty pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.20 (1985) was properly applied, because appellant was aware of the Barragan decision and its retroactive application and failed to pay appellee the benefits owed him with in the required 10 days. Thus, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed workers' compensation order that required appellant employer to pay appellee claimant retroactive benefits because of the improper offset of workers' compensation benefits against his disability retirement pension benefits. The court refused to direct appellant how to allocate the permitted offset for the benefits that exceeded appellee's average monthly wages, because appellant was responsible for maintaining both benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellant challenged a final judgment entered in favor of appellee insurance company denying coverage of certain chiropractic expenses. The reviewing court held that where an insurance contract was entered into, the parties were presumed to have entered into the agreement with reference to existing statutes, and statutory provisions therefore became a part of the contract. Where terms made the contract subject to different reasonable interpretations, one of coverage and one of exclusion, an ambiguity existed. Since an insurer, as draftsman of the policy, would not be allowed to use obscure terms to defeat the purpose for which a policy was purchased, the terms were liberally construed in favor of coverage so that the interpretation allowing greater indemnity would prevail. Therefore the case was reversed and remanded for determination of the proper coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's denial of appellants' motion for a new trial in appellants' personal injury action against appellee.

Appellants' argument that the language of Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061 allowed fees to a defendant only when judgment was in favor of a plaintiff was without merit. The court remanded appellee's motion for attorney's fees for a determination as to the formalities of compliance with Fla.

The court held that the legislature did not have the power to take away a civil cause of action for unintentional acts by coemployees, and thus the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the access to courts provision in Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his habitual felony offender sentences imposed upon his convictions for second degree murder and robbery. Appellant contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, the habitual offender statute, was unconstitutional, violating the U.S. Const. amend. XIV equal protection clause by creating irrational classifications, violating the U.S. Const. amend. V and amend. XVI due process clauses, and violating the separation of powers doctrine. The court affirmed appellant's habitual offender sentences and reasoned that appellant's aforementioned contentions had been considered many times by the court and rejected accordingly. However, in light of recent case law, the court certified a question of whether Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 violated due process, equal protection and the separation of powers doctrine, for review by the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants agreed to sell a parcel of land to a company to build a customer service center. The sale was contingent on whether appellee city council approved the center. Appellee rejected the site plan, and although the reason for denial was erroneous as a matter of law, appellee's decision was upheld. Appellants sought review. In reversing the decision, the court held that it was error to conduct a de novo review because the administrative procedure for site plan approval was quasi-judicial in nature and certiorari review was proper. Adhering to the view expressed in Corn, the function of appellee in reviewing purchasers proposed site plan for development of the property was administrative in nature. Appellee could not unreasonably withhold approval when the legislatively adopted legal requirements were met. Where all the legal requirements for site plans were met, no element of discretion remained, and there was no residual discretion to refuse site plan approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee brought a breach of contract action against defendant employer that sought recovery of sales commissions he earned while employed as a sale representative for defendant. Judgment was entered that found plaintiff employee was entitled to sales commission he earned under his oral employment agreement with defendant, and attorney's fees awarded to plaintiff. Defendant sought review. In reversing in part, the court held it was error to double the amount of compensatory damages sustained by plaintiff. Fla. Stat. ch. 686.201(1991) was declared unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3 because the statute on its face discriminated against interstate commerce by imposing requirements on out-of-state principals or companies that were not applicable to in-state businesses. However, the usage-of-trade evidence was properly admitted to construe the parties' oral agreement. Although the attorney's fee award was made under the authority of ch. 686.201, the award was nonetheless sustainable under Fla. Stat. ch. 448.08 (1991).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision that doubled the amount of compensatory damages sustained by plaintiff, holding the statute that allowed the doubling was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause because on its face, it discriminated against interstate commerce by imposing requirements on out-of-state principals that were not applicable to in-state businesses.

Appellant challenged the circuit court's decision, claiming that appellee did not have standing to seek a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of its own ordinance and that, despite the ruling that the ordinance was unconstitutional, appellee should have been estopped from denying appellant pension benefits because he retired in good faith reliance on representations that the pension was legal. The appellate court affirmed the circuit court's decision, explaining that appellee had standing to seek declaratory judgment because under Fla. Stat. ch. 86.011 the circuit court was the proper tribunal to determine the constitutionality of ordinances. Additionally, estoppel did not apply to bar denial of appellant's pension benefits because appellee's representations to appellant were representations of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners filed a writ of certiorari seeking review of an order from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which, in a medical malpractice action, found that the legislature did not intend that the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Plan, Fla. Stat. ch. 766.301 et. seq. (1991), applied to &quot;death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners moved to dismiss a malpractice action, alleging that the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Plan (Plan), Fla. Stat. ch. 766.301 (1991), provided an exclusive administrative remedy where an infant suffered neurological injury during birth even where death resulted. The underlying plaintiffs countered that the text of the statute, consistent with its title, evinced a legislative intent that it apply only in cases where the injured infant survived, and not an intent that the plan superseded or modified the wrongful death statute. The court quashed and remanded the order of respondent trial court, holding that birth-related neurological injuries which resulted in post-delivery death were within the Plan, and that the administrative rights and remedies granted by the Plan for birth-related neurological injury were exclusive unless there was clear and convincing evidence of bad faith, malicious purpose, or willful and wanton conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted certiorari, quashing and remanding the cause, because birth-related neurological injuries resulting in post-delivery death were within the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Plan (Plan), and, accordingly, the administrative rights and remedies granted by the Plan for birth-related neurological injury were exclusive unless bad faith, malicious purpose, or willful and wanton conduct were evident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) that found Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(e)1 (1991) unconstitutional on its face and as it applied to appellee, based on the cruel and unusual punishment provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, who had no prior felony convictions, was arrested for buying one rock of crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of an elementary school and was charged with a first degree felony under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(e)1 (1991). She filed a motion seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional, which the trial court granted, holding that the statute violated the cruel or unusual punishment provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, because a first time offender faced a three-year mandatory minimum sentence. The trial court found that a three-year mandatory minimum sentence was a cruel punishment, because it precluded a trial court from referring a defendant to a drug treatment program instead of, or in addition to, a prison term. Appellant state sought review, and the court reversed. The court held that the minimum three-year sentence was not mandatory, and that since a trial court had the discretion to refer appellee to a drug treatment program under Fla. Stat. ch. 397.12 (1991), the statute did not violate the cruel and unusual punishment provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, school board and individuals, were required to submit a tentative budget with proposed millage rates, but appellees required a higher millage than the .510 maximum rate permitted by the legislature for the year for nonvoted discretionary ad valorem taxes. Pursuant to Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9 and art. IX, &sect; 4, appellees claimed they had authority to set a millage rate within a 10 mill limit. Appellees filed an action for declaratory judgment against the county tax collector and alleged that the legislature's action in setting the millage at .510 was facially unconstitutional. Appellees served the state attorney, who moved for dismissal because appellant Department of Education had not been served as the real party in interest. The court held that the trial court properly denied the motion and that appellant was not a necessary or indispensable party, but that the tax collector was. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 236.25(1) and Fla. Laws ch. 91-193(1)(509) were unconstitutional to the extent the statutes limited appellees' right to levy ad valorem taxes within the 10 mill constitutional limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his sentence, arguing 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 89-280, which amended Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, the habitual felony offender provision, violated the one-subject rule of the Florida constitution. Defendant qualified as a habitual violent felony offender for the offense of aggravated battery. Aggravated battery was included in the statute as an offense that could be utilized in determining habitual offender status. The offense was committed within the time period between October 1, 1989, the effective date of the 1989 amendments to the habitual offender statute, and the reenactment of the statute, May 2, 1991. However, the court had held in prior case law that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 as amended by 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 89-280, violated the single-subject rule. Therefore, a sentence as a habitual offender based upon the 1989 amendments for a crime that was committed within the period of October 1, 1989, to May 2, 1991, was illegal. The prosecution argued that the issue was not properly preserved for appeal. However, the court rejected the prosecution's argument, vacated defendant's sentence, and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 34.021 (1991), requiring a candidate for county judge to have been a member of the state bar for five years at the time he or she qualified for election, was constitutional, and that said statute barred appellant's name from appearing on the election ballot, as he did not meet the statute's requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant and appellee were candidates for election for county judge. Appellant had not been a member of the bar for five years prior to filing his qualifying papers, and filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that Fla.

The trial court held that ch. 34.021 was constitutional, and appellant challenged the trial court's order. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the 1972 Florida Constitution had provided only that a county judge be a member of the bar at the time he or she took office, but gave power to the legislature to otherwise provide by law, and to increase the minimum requirements, contrary to appellant's arguments. The court found that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 was amended in 1984 to increase requirements for the office, and clearly authorized a law like that set forth in ch. 34.021. The court held that even if ch. 34.021 was invalid as enacted in 1984, its reenactment after the 1984 amendment to art. V, &sect; 8 rendered the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed orders from the Circuit Court of Escambia County (Florida) convicting him and sentencing him on three counts of sexual battery upon a child less than 12 years old and one count of handling or fondling the same child in a lewd and lascivious manner. Defendant argued the victim was improperly allowed to testify via closed circuit television.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on three counts of sexual battery of a child less than 12 years old and one count of handling or fondling the same child in a lewd and lascivious manner. Defendant appealed, asserting the child victim was improperly allowed to testify via closed circuit television. Defendant also argued that hearsay evidence was erroneously admitted. The court held that defendant waived his objection to the admission of the child witness' closed circuit television testimony because his objection did not specify the way in which Fla. Stat. ch. 92.54(5), the statute allowing such testimony, was violated. Further, defendant failed to contemporaneously challenge the trial court's findings made under Fla. Stat. ch. 92.54(5) for competency or sufficiency. Though the court found that the error defendant raised was not fundamental, the court certified a question of great public importance as to whether a trial court's failure to make the findings required by the statute constituted fundamental error. The court rejected defendant's challenge of certain evidence as inadmissible hearsay, and affirmed the convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Orders of conviction and sentence were affirmed as defendant failed to properly preserve his objection to the decision to allow the child witness to testify via closed circuit television, and as no inadmissible hearsay evidence was admitted.

The trial court overruled the objection, and the jury returned a verdict for aggravated battery. On appeal, the court reduced appellant's his conviction to simple battery because the use of appellant's bare hands and fists did not constitute deadly weapons pursuant to the Model Penal Code &sect; 210.0(4) and Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which granted appellee restaurant association summary judgment in an action by appellee for declaratory and injunctive relief following the enactment of an ordinance requiring that health warnings be posted in certain establishments serving alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee restaurant association argued that appellant county acted ultra vires in enacting an ordinance requiring the posting of health warnings in certain establishments serving alcohol, because the state had a pervasive regulatory scheme in the preparation, service, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Disagreeing with the trial court's conclusion that the ordinance was unconstitutional, the court first acknowledged that appellee possessed standing to seek relief because a substantial number of appellee's members were affected by the ordinance and because the members would suffer injury of the kind comprising a justiciable injury had they individually brought suit. However, the state regulatory scheme was not so pervasive as to preempt appellee from enacting the ordinance. The &quot;regulation and inspection&quot; language of Fla. Stat. ch. 381.061(9) (1989) merely allowed the state to adopt rules for training managers in food safety, but did not expressly or by implication prevent the type of action appellant required of appellee. Finally, the ordinance was not inconsistent with general law and, thereby, violative of Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(g), because it contradicted no existing law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Order granting appellee restaurant association summary judgment in action contesting appellant county's enactment of an ordinance requiring that health warning signs be posted in places serving alcohol was reversed, and summary judgment granted to appellant, because ordinance was not preempted, either expressly or impliedly, by any existing state regulatory scheme, and because ordinance was not inconsistent with general law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled no contest to two counts of attempted second degree murder with a firearm and one count of shooting into a building. Defendant was sentenced as a habitual offender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a) (1989). A statute that amended ch. 775.084 was held unconstitutional after defendant's sentencing with the consequence that the evidence presented at defendant's sentencing hearing was insufficient to adjudicate him a habitual offender. The state conceded the fact, but argued that defendant could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal. The state alleged that violation of the single-subject rule was not fundamental error. The appellate court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded with directions, holding that violation of the single-subject rule was fundamental error that could be raised for the first time on appeal. Further, the court certified the following question: Whether 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 89-280 amendments to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989) were unconstitutional prior to their reenactment as part of the Florida Statutes, because of violation of the single-subject rule of the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged the decision of the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida), which retroactively applied a state supreme court decision and ordered appellant to pay appellee firefighter certain permanent total disability compensation benefits that appellant had withheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city offset appellee firefighter's permanent total disability (PTD) compensation benefits against his disability retirement pension benefits. In another case, the state supreme court held that such an offset was invalid. However, appellant did not give retroactive effect to the decision and did not pay appellee any past offset benefits. Appellee filed a claim for the withheld benefits under the state supreme court decision. The judge of compensation claims ordered appellant to pay the full amount of past benefits under the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that retroactive application of the decision did not impair appellant municipality's rights even though persons like appellee would receive monies that they did not expect to receive and even though appellant was in a financial crisis because of the decision. The court further determined that appellant's claim for the offset benefits was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata because of the intervening decision that changed the applicable law. Moreover, the court ruled that appellant had to pay a punitive fee because it had initially accepted appellee's claim for benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judge of compensation claim's decision, allowing the retroactive application of a controlling case because doing so did not impair appellant city's rights. The court concluded that the doctrine of res judicata did not bar appellee firefighter's claim for certain withheld benefits because a state supreme court decision had changed the applicable law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Okaloosa County (Florida), which sentenced him under the habitual felony offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced as a habitual felony offender. On review, appellant argued that Fla. Laws ch. 89-280, by which the habitual felony offender statute was amended, violated the single subject rule of the Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. Because the prosecution failed to prove that appellant qualified for sentencing under the previous version of the statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, (1988), appellant argued that his sentences should be reversed. The state contended that appellant was precluded from raising this argument because he neglected to raise it before the trial court. The court found that, as a recognized principal, a facial invalidity challenge to an act of the legislature based upon violation of the Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 was entitled to be raised for the first time on appeal, so long as the challenged act affected a central issue in the litigation. Here, appellant was sentenced under the habitual felony offender statute and the statute affected a central issue in the litigation. Therefore, he was entitled to raise the issue for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, the habitual felony offender sentences were reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed appellant's habitual felony offender sentences, remanded the cause to the trial court for resentencing, and certified a question to the supreme court because the habitual felony offender statute, as amended, violated the single subject rule of the Florida constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court first rejected the argument that the use of the same prior felony conviction used to convict appellant of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and to sentence him as a habitual felon was violative of double jeopardy prohibitions. The court certified the question of whether such use was unconstitutional. The court next certified the question of whether appellant's substantive due process rights were violated when he was classified as a violent felony offender and subjected to extended imprisonment even though the present offense was nonviolent. The court also certified the question of whether Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(b) (1989) violated constitutional protections against double jeopardy by increasing appellant's punishment due to the nature of a prior offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed appellant's habitual felon sentence under the statute and certified questions of whether the use of the same conviction for purposes of possession of a firearm by a felon conviction and the sentence extension as a habitual felon were violative of double jeopardy. The court certified additional important public issues of whether the use of sentence extension based on the nature of offense was violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), denying his motion to dismiss charges for possession with intent to sell an imitation controlled substance, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.564(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police arrested defendant on an outstanding warrant and found what they thought was crack cocaine in his pocket, but that was actually wax. Defendant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 817.564(3), which made it unlawful to possess with intent to sell any imitation controlled substance. Defendant moved to dismiss the charges under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4). The trial court denied his motion. Defendant appealed. The court reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss. The proper interpretation of the statute was the sole issue on appeal and dispositive of the case. The essence of the dispute was that defendant contended that the phrase &quot;which is subject to abuse&quot; referred to, modified, and was part of the definition of the phrase &quot;imitation controlled substance&quot; and referred, here, to the wax. The state contended the phrase referred to genuine controlled substances in ch. 893, i.e. the cocaine. Defendant's interpretation was the same as Jones court's interpretation, and the court adopted it. The charging document was substantially defective in that it was self-contradictory on its face. It failed to state essential facts constituting a violation of ch. 817.564.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed an order denying defendant's motion to dismiss charges for possession with intent to sell an imitation controlled substance because the charging document failed to adequately allege an offense, and the court remanded with directions to dismiss the information and the cause, and to discharge defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida), which denied his motion for post-conviction relief filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Defendant challenged his five-year sentence as an habitual violent felony offender for pleading guilty to robbery, trespass of an unoccupied structure, and resisting arrest without violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that his prior record did not qualify him for habitual violent felony offender (HVFO) status, that his plea was induced by counsel's misinformation regarding eligibility for gain-time, and that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (Supp. 1988) was unconstitutional. The court found that defendant's allegation of misrepresentation by counsel did not support a claim because he did not allege that he would not have entered the plea if given the correct information. The court also found that the argument regarding the unconstitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (Supp. 1988) had been previously rejected. However, the court reversed and remanded on the issue of defendant's HVFO status because there was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant qualified for HVFO status either because said status was not determined by the lower court or because that portion of the record was not submitted on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's sentence except as to defendant's habitual violent felony offender (HVFO) status. The court reversed the HVFO status because there was nothing in the record on appeal supporting the classification. The court remanded for either the attachment of that portion of the record supporting the HVFO status or for a hearing on the matter.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 526 (1989), which enjoined all parties from selling motor fuel below cost. Appellant alleged the Act unconstitutionally prohibited fair competition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee retailer brought suit against appellant competitor and sought injunctive relief and damages. Appellee alleged that appellant was selling motor fuel below costs in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 526.304(1)(a) (1989) of the Motor Fuel Marketing Practices Act (Act). Appellant admitted to selling fuel under cost, but alleged it had done so only to meet other competition. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the Act and argued that it unduly restricted the economic bargaining power of consumers and was not rationally related to furthering the general public welfare. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the Act was constitutional and that it met the legitimate state objective of protecting fair competition by preventing &quot;predatory pricing&quot; schemes designed solely to force competitors out of business, thus lessening competition and ultimately raising prices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's temporary preliminary injunction against appellant competitor and upheld the constitutionality of the Motor Fuel Marketing Practices Act and found that it was rationally related to furthering the objective of protecting competition in the retail motor fuel market by prohibiting unfair &quot;predatory pricing&quot; practices.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court found that defendant had knowledge, well in advance of the sentencing proceeding, of the state's intent to seek enhanced sentencing. Furthermore, because sentencing was postponed for a week after the state announced its intention and presented the predicate convictions, the court found that defendant had ample opportunity to contest the convictions, but did not do so.

Stat. ch. 163.3215 (1989), which required appellant to file a verified complaint with the local government in order to challenge the consistency of its proposed development with the comprehensive plan.

Appellees were not required to reduce their decision to writing before the statutory time frame to file the complaint began to run. A writ of certiorari was unavailable because the statute provided the sole means to challenge the denial of appellant's subdivision plat on the basis that it was inconsistent with a comprehensive plan.

Stat. ch. 39.061. Appellants contended that the statute was constitutionally infirm as an invalid delegation of legislative authority in contravention of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The court determined that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not contain standards sufficiently explicit to inform the discretion of the agency charged with administering it, thereby rendering it vulnerable to challenge under the non-delegation doctrine. The court noted that because the statute operated upon fundamental personal rights, and provided for criminal penalties, the more exacting standard for legislative guidance should have been employed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before defendant's plea of no contest to burglary of a structure, plaintiff state moved to have defendant declared an habitual felony offender. Defendant moved the trial court to declare that the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989), was unconstitutional. Defendant presented evidence that there was disparity in the application of the statute between counties and between the number of persons eligible for sentencing as habitual offenders and those sentenced as such. The trial court denied defendant's motion and sentenced him as a habitual felony offender. The court affirmed because there was no equal protection violation merely because the statute permitted selective application of habitual offender status, nor was the process unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of three cases, consolidated for appeal, in which appellee Department of Veteran &amp; Community Affairs (Florida) had classified three districts within the county as dependent districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant raised the issues of whether the ad valorem millage limitations applicable to counties and dependent special districts in Fla. Stat. ch. 200.071 were an unconstitutional denial or impairment of the ad valorem taxing power granted to counties directly under Fla. Const. Art. VII, &sect; 9, and whether the classification of special districts as dependent or independent pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 200 was not on any basis reasonably related to general law ad valorem millage determinations or limitations, and was therefore unconstitutional under Fla. Const. Art. III, &sect; 11(b). The court found that ch. 200.071 was a restriction on the millage of special districts rather than on the millage of the county, and because the statute could be read to be a limitation on district millage, it did not violate Fla. Const. Art. VII, &sect; 9. The court found that the act was not violative of Fla. Const. Art. III, &sect; 11 because the classification system based on the level of control exercised by another unit of government had a direct relationship to issues besides the limitation on millage, such as accountability and financial reporting requirements, as well as planning responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment classifying the districts as dependent districts and held that the ad valorem millage limitations in a statute were not unconstitutional because the statute could be read to be a limitation on district millage and the classification of special districts as dependent or independent was not unconstitutional because it had a direct relationship to issues such as accountability and financial reporting requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was a shareholder of the company that held title to property encumbered by a mortgage held by appellee bank. The company also entered into a subordination agreement providing for transfer of the fee simple title of the property to appellee in the event of a default on the promissory note. The promissory note went into default, and appellee commenced an action to foreclose. The trial court subsequently entered judgment for appellee, and an appeal ensued. Appellant claimed to be a bona fide purchaser (BFP) without notice of the subordination agreement, thereby insulating his fee simple title interest from the obligations of that agreement. The trial court found that appellant did not enjoy the status of BFP. The court affirmed that finding, on the alternative grounds that appellant did not give valuable consideration at the time he acquired title and/or appellant had actual or constructive notice of the preexisting encumbrance (the subordination agreement) at the time he acquired the fee simple title from the company. For these reasons, appellant could not claim the status of a BFP, and the judgment in favor of appellee was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the foreclosure judgment in favor of appellee bank because appellant shareholder was not a bona fide purchaser, and was therefore subject to the mortgage and subordination agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled guilty to grand theft of an automobile and was sentenced to probation. The probation was conditioned upon appellant making restitution for the stolen automobile, and to make restitution for items stolen on that same day from the house where he was living. Appellant was not convicted of any offense for the missing items from the house where he resided, but did not object to the order of restitution at the time of sentencing. The appellate court affirmed the order of restitution, holding that while the order was improper, appellant had waived his right to appeal. The court ruled that a defendant could only be ordered to pay restitution for damages caused directly or indirectly from the act for which he was convicted. The court further ruled that because appellant failed to raise an objection to the trial court, he had waived his right to appeal the restitution order for the items in the house.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of restitution. The court found that it was not fundamental error for the trial court to impose a condition of probation that included a requirement that appellant make restitution for the items for which he had not been convicted. The court found that appellant had waived appeal by not objecting to the restitution order at the time it was imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee corporation bought coal from other states to run its facilities. Appellee was taxed under Fla. Stat. ch. 212.059 (1987) (repealed 1988) (Ch. 212) on half of the transportation charges it paid under the coal contracts regardless of the miles transportated in Florida. Appellant department sought review after the lower court found that Ch. 212 violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 (Commerce Clause) as applied to appellee. The court found that a tax statute complied with the Commerce Clause if it was applied to an activity with a substantial nexus to the taxing state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to services provided by the state. The court reversed. The nexus prong was undisputed. The court found that Ch. 212 was a use tax on transportation services and that appellee was deriving a direct benefit by receiving coal, regardless of the miles spent transporting it there. The tax was equally apportioned between the two states with nexus. Facially, Ch. 212 did not discriminate against interstate commerce because it did not put greater burdens on those outside the state or give Florida residents an unfair advantage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant tenants sued defendant landlord for damages after appellant husband fell over pipes on the rental property. Appellants also sought a temporary injunction to prevent defendant from evicting them under Fla. Stat. ch. 51.011 (1989). Appellants claimed that Fla. Stat. ch. 51.011 was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the statute was constitutional and denied the temporary injunction. The court affirmed the finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 51.011 was constitutional. The court rejected appellants' additional challenge to the constitutionality of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.010, which authorized the statutory enactment of rules for summary procedure. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.010 was not unconstitutional because it provided that summary claims procedure statutes, such as Fla. Stat. ch. 51.011, governed only if they did not conflict with the state rules of civil procedure. The court also affirmed the denial of injunctive relief because appellants had an adequate remedy at law. If defendant filed an eviction action, appellants could raise their constitutional argument at that time. Appellants would, thus, not suffer irreparable harm if the temporary injunction was not granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother challenged an amended final judgment from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County, (Florida) in a paternity case raising multiple issues as possible error. Appellee father cross-appealed as to a provision in the final judgment to the effect the child shall bear his mother's surname and challenged the refusal to award him attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 742.031 (1989) as the prevailing party in the paternity action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An amended final judgment of paternity was entered in the trial court where appellant mother was awarded custody of a minor child and appellee was adjudged the child's father. Appellant mother challenged the final judgment raising five issues. Appellee father cross-appealed concerning whether the trial court had properly held the minor child was to bear his mother's surname and the refusal to award him attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 742.031 (1989) as the prevailing party in the paternity action. The court found the trial court had applied Fla. Stat. ch. 382.013(5)(b)(1989) which applied only where there was no paternity litigation and that instead, Fla. Stat. ch. 382.013(6)(c)(1989) applied which allowed the court to place the father's name on the birth certificate and specify a surname for the child. The court remanded for the court to make further inquiry into the name issue. The court also reviewed a provision in the paternity action law, ch. 742.031, that allowed mothers to get attorney's fees from fathers, and not vice versa. The court decreed the statute was to apply without gender-based distinctions and remanded for the trial court to address appellee's motion for fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court judgment as to appellant mother, but reversed and remanded as to the issues brought by appellee father as to attorney's fees and the minor child's surname. The court found that appellee, as the prevailing party in the paternity action, was able apply for attorney's fees though he was the father and not the mother because the applicable statute had not been interpreted to apply in a gender neutral manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant agreed to testify against his codefendant. During the codefendant's trial, appellant invoked his U.S. Const. amend. V privilege against self-incrimination with respect to 12 separate prosecution questions. Appellant was found guilty of 12 separate criminal contempt offenses. Appellant was also convicted of trafficking and possession of the same controlled substances. Appellant sought review of all convictions, and the appellate court reversed and remanded for resentencing for one contempt count and trafficking. The appellate court held that although appellant exercised his U.S. Const. amend. V privilege on numerous questions, it was still one continuous crime of contempt. The court also ruled that appellant could not be convicted of trafficking and simple possession of the same drugs as this violated his right to be free from double jeopardy. Because each offense was based on appellant's possession of the same cocaine at the same time and place, he could be convicted of trafficking. The court also stated that an appeal of an unconstitutional dual conviction and sentence was not waived by a no contest plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant engineer, found guilty of misconduct in his practice by appellee Department of Professional Regulation, Board of Professional Engineers, challenged this decision. The court reviewed the applicable law and determined that, while Fla.

Here the term &quot;misconduct&quot; was very broad and the court recommended that the legislature define its meaning. However, the court did not declare the statute unconstitutionally vague. A review of the record indicated that a disagreement arose between appellant and his client concerning a bill that charged the client for additional fees for services beyond the initial amount to which they had agreed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police detectives approached a house they were about to search pursuant to a search warrant, and they saw appellant standing outside the house holding a brown paper package. When appellant saw the police, he ran into the house. The package contained cocaine rocks. Appellant was charged and convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. Appellant sought review of his conviction on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court's verdict, the reasonable doubt instruction deprived him of due process, and the trial court's determination that appellant was a violent habitual offender was invalid. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence because there was sufficient evidence in the record to support an inference of appellant's possession and intent to sell or distribute illegal drugs. Further, the court held that there was no error in the trial court giving the standard reasonable doubt instruction, or in imposition of appellant's sentence as a violent habitual offender based upon appellant's prior strong arm robbery conviction, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4)(b)(2) (1989).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was approached by a confidential informant who promised him money if appellant could introduce him to a purchaser of a large amount of cocaine. Appellant stated he did not want to get involved. Nevertheless, the informant continued to contact appellant and tried to persuade appellant to get involved. Eventually, appellant introduced the informant to a co-worker. After the drug transaction was finalized, appellant and his co-worker were arrested and charged with trafficking in cocaine. Appellant moved to dismiss the charges on the grounds his due process rights were violated and that he had been entrapped. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant sought review. The court reversed and dismissed the charges. Appellant's due process rights were not violated because the informant's payment was not contingent upon his testifying at trial. However, appellant made a showing of entrapment because there was no specific ongoing criminal activity until the informant created that activity.</SPAN></P>

Appellant did not prove a violation of his due process rights; however, he did show entrapment because the police activity did not have as its end the interruption of a specific ongoing criminal activity. Appellant was not involved in any criminal activity until he was induced to do so by the informant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Duval County (Florida), sentencing appellant as a habitual violent felony offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, following appellant's conviction for unarmed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of unarmed robbery and sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender. He challenged his sentence, arguing that the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, was unconstitutional, and that the trial court failed to make all of the findings requisite to the imposition of a habitual violent felony offender sentence. With respect to appellant's first contention, the court found that the habitual offender statute had withstood numerous prior constitutional challenges, and therefore, the sentence was affirmed as to that particular issue. However, the court reversed appellant's sentence, because the state failed to meet its burden of proving that appellant had not been pardoned of a previous offense or that the previous offense was not set aside in a post-conviction proceeding, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(b)(3) and (4). Determining that appellant presented questions of great public importance, both issues were certified to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Although the habitual offender statute was constitutional, appellant was improperly sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender, because the state failed to prove the lack of any pardon or post-conviction relief setting aside a prior offense by appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury pursuant to the standard jury instruction because the instruction on reasonable doubt accurately informed the jury of the law. However, the court held that the trial court improperly adjudicated defendant guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm in the commission of an armed robbery and attempted first degree murder with a firearm. The court reversed defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony because the firearm was used to enhance the sentence for attempted first degree murder.

They succeeded in obtaining the victim's wallet after ripping the pocket from the victim's trousers. The victim's elbow was shattered and required extensive surgery. Appellant was tried and convicted of robbery and aggravated battery because of the attack. On appeal, appellant alleged violations of the federal double jeopardy clause, U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV, and Fla. Stat. ch. 775.021(4) in that the convictions were based upon the same conduct. The court stated that the battery committed by appellant was an act or series of acts which occurred during the taking of the victim's wallet. Applying statutory interpretation, the court found that each crime had a non-common element which required further analysis to determine whether the presumption that the offenses were separate could be defeated. The court held that appellant's convictions were not violative of the double jeopardy prohibition because he was not subject to multiple punishments for the same offense. Therefore, judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant department advised appellee corporation that it was being fined for failing to make a timely worker's compensation payment to claimant. Appellee asked appellant to reconsider, but appellant forwarded the matter to a compensation claims judge. Appellee filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the county where its headquarters were located. Appellant moved to dismiss on grounds that as a state agency, it was entitled to a venue privilege. The lower court denied the motion, and appellant sought review. The court found that absent waiver or exception in civil actions brought against the state, its agencies or subdivisions, venue would lie in the county of its principal headquarters. Appellant's principal place of business was not in the county where the complaint was filed. The court found that appellant's procedures for determining when an assessment was proper under Fla. Stat. chs. 440.25(3), (4) (Supp. 1990) did not deprive appellee of any procedural due process rights because it provided notice and an opportunity to contest the assessment.

On appeal, the court held that the remedies were consistent with, and gave effect to, legislative intent that residents of mobile home parks should not be subject to any charge which is not set forth in the mobile home park prospectus and had not been disclosed prior to tenancy. The court affirmed because it concluded that the violations specified and the remedies imposed by appellee were appropriate to the circumstances of the case and were authorized by the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 723.006 (Supp. 1986). The court modified the order to reflect that homeowners who were delivered a prospectus after assuming occupancy in the park, would be assessed for water, sewer, and waste disposal based on the disclosures contained in the prospectus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two unrelated cases, both defendants were convicted of life felonies. The trial court sentenced both defendants as habitual felony offenders. On appeal, defendants argued that the habitual felony offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989), did not apply to life felonies because subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) did not specifically mention life felonies. The court rejected defendants' reading of the statute in part because it made no sense to exempt those who committed the most serious felonies from enhanced punishment under the statute. The court held that life felonies were subject to the provisions of the statute, which authorized extended terms of imprisonment for life felons under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4)(e). The court affirmed the sentencing of defendants, who were convicted of life felonies, as habitual offenders. As to defendant one, the court reversed part of his sentence because the trial court ascribed its authority to statutory provisions that did not apply. As to defendant two, the court reversed his conviction and sentence for improper exhibition of a firearm on double jeopardy grounds because he was convicted of murder with the same firearm.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 742.031 to be unconstitutional to the extent it deprived respondent of his right to a jury trial. The court determined that the paternity proceeding was akin to paternity actions under Florida territorial law, which provided for jury trials. Because Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was charged with murder buy the state. Her conviction was reversed due to the fact that the last of her four custodial statements was improperly admitted. Prior to her retrial, appellee successfully persuaded the circuit court to exclude her third custodial statement as well, not because of any unconstitutionality in its acquisition, but because its exculpatory nature rendered it inadmissible as a statement against interest. On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's ruling and remanded the case for trial. The appellate court held that the circuit court had confused the statement against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule with the admission of a party opponent; admissions, unlike statements against interest, need not be against one's interest, and they are admissible simply because one cannot complain about the inability to cross-examine one's self.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant agent sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) denying its motion to dissolve a temporary injunction in appellee lessor's action asserting a landlord's lien for unpaid rent of an office building and a security interest in the property on the leased premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee lessor leased office space to a corporation that administered health plans. Corporation contracted with appellant agent to continue its work. Appellant never contracted to lease the premises, but made a facilities access agreement with corporation to share the office space. Appellant also agreed that if it made rental payments, it was doing so only as corporation's agent. Appellant made several rental payments, then notified appellee it was vacating the premises. Appellee filed suit, asserting a landlord's lien for rent past due and a security interest in all office property. The lower court granted a temporary injunction prohibiting appellant from removing its furniture and equipment from the offices and denied appellant's motion to dissolve. The court found the requirements for issuing a temporary injunction had not been met. Appellant's breach of lease and lien claims had adequate remedies at law; thus, equitable relief was improper. Appellee also made no showing of irreparable harm, and there appeared to be a genuine issue whether appellee could prevail on the merits. Accordingly, the order was reversed and remanded with directions to dissolve the judgment.</SPAN></P>

A dispute arose over petitioner's performance under and outside the contract. Respondents filed a multi-count complaint against petitioner in an employment termination dispute. Petitioner counterclaimed, alleging that respondent unlawfully entered and unlawfully took possession of the pro shop. He requested a judgment awarding possession of the property, and damages. When respondent failed to respond to the counterclaim, petitioner served a motion for default and request to docket. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim. The trial court denied petitioner's motion. On appeal, the court held that respondent was wrong in relying on its motion to toll the time to file its answer. By failing to file all its defenses, it was exposed to entry of the default. However, the court determined that prior to the hearing on the default, respondent's motion to dismiss did contain the statement of a defense. The court labeled respondent's motion a defective answer. Therefore, petitioner was not entitled to default, and petitioner's writ of certiorari was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order denying petitioner's motion for default was upheld and petitioner's request for writ of certiorari was denied, because he was not entitled to default after respondent filed a motion to dismiss which was construed as a defective answer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was a former county commissioner. He obtained permission from his fellow commissioners to personally go to out-of-state to inspect and purchase some items of heavy construction equipment. He made several requests to have a truck fueled at the county shop. It was later discovered that appellant transacted his private business with the truck. He was charged and convicted of petit theft, grand theft, and official misconduct. On appeal, the court affirmed the theft convictions. However, it reversed the conviction for official misconduct, and remanded for a new trial. The court held that a higher court had declared Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(a), prohibiting a public servant from knowingly refraining, or causing another to refrain from performing a duty imposed upon him by law was unconstitutionally vague and did not therefore describe an act that could be criminally proscribed by statute. Therefore, the conviction could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Order convicting appellant of petit theft and grand theft was affirmed because appellant was not justified in transacting personal business with the city's truck and personnel.

Stat. ch. 119.11(1) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court granted the requested mandamus relief and ordered the hearing under Fla. Stat. ch. 119.11(1) (1989). The appellate court rejected respondent city's contention that the word &quot;immediate,&quot; as used in the Public Records Act, meant, absent a demonstrated emergency, as being within a reasonable time. The appellate court also rejected the argument that the provision in the Public Records Act regarding priority for petitioner citizens' case was an unconstitutional encroachment on the judicial branch's constitutional authority to establish rules of procedure for the courts. The appellate court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 119.11(1) was effective where noting in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure directly contradicted that provision. The appellate court concluded by noting that although the statutory hearing provision on public records cases did not mean that a previously scheduled hearing in a different matter had to be canceled, Fla. Stat. ch. 119.11(1) did mandate that a hearing, if requested, had to be given priority over more routine maters, and that a good faith effort had to be made to accommodate the legislative desire that an immediate hearing be held.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant passenger was in an accident and received an injury, which use of a seatbelt could have prevented. The seatbelt left appellee seatbelt manufacturer without a defect, but appellee was aware of the product's potential to develop a defect through ordinary use. Appellant sued appellee on theories of strict liability and negligent failure to warn. The jury found no defect existed when the seatbelt left appellee but that a later defect developed for which appellee was negligent in failing to warn. The trial court entered a judgment against appellee, but later granted its motion for a new trial on the grounds the verdict was inconsistent. The court reversed and remanded. Appellee waived the inconsistent verdict issue by failing to object while the jury was present. There were compelling reasons not to excuse a failure to speak out when the jury could have corrected the supposed error: the sanctity of a jury verdict and society's interest in avoiding repeat trials for the same dispute. Further, the jury's verdict was internally consistent. The seatbelt did not have to be defective when it left appellee as it was foreseeable a defect could develop after normal use.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the statute was constitutional. The court found that the statute met substantive due process requirements because it bore a reasonable relationship to a permissible legislative objective, curtailing the mobility of those involved in drug offenses to deter drug crimes and was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive. Because there was no fundamental right to drive and the statute was not directed toward a suspect class, it was analyzed under a rational basis standard. The statute did not violate equal protection principles, even though not all drug offenders were treated similarly, because it formed a permissible classification, which included one, but not others who might have been included in the broader classification, but those within the legally formed class were accorded equal treatment. The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 697.07 (1989) unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The appellate court determined that the statute did not conflict with Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.600. The appellate court further determined that the statute gave the court authority to require a party to involuntarily deposit money into the court registry, whereby Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.600 pertained to a voluntary deposit by a party of money or property upon notice and permission of the court. Furthermore, the language contained in the mortgage provided for the assignment of rents.</SPAN></P>

The Florida Insurance Guaranty Association served notice of a deadline to file a claim against the insurance carrier by publication. Appellant filed her claim beyond the deadline, and the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. Appellant challenged, claiming that the notice by publication was unconstitutional because it deprived her of due process of law. The court disagreed and held that because there was no evidence that appellant did not have knowledge of the order setting the deadline for filing of claims, and because she knew that insurance carrier was insolvent, there was no violation of her due process rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant foster care counselor was the assigned worker on a child victim's case. In accordance with the law, she developed a performance agreement for reunifying the child victim with his parents. Pursuant to the performance agreement and with approval of the juvenile judge, the parents obtained custody of the child victim on extended visit, which meant that the child victim returned to his parents' home from foster care. The child victim was murdered by his stepfather. Appellant was convicted of child abuse by culpable negligence, and of failure to report an incident of child abuse. On appeal, the child abuse conviction was reversed. The state's case against her on that count was based on her alleged failure to provide information to the juvenile judge. The state argued that if she had provided the information, then the juvenile judge would have prevented the child victim's return to his parents' home. The court found no showing that the juvenile judge would have changed any of her rulings if she had the additional information. The court affirmed appellant's conviction for failure to report an incident of child abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found guilty of armed burglary, armed robbery, and armed sexual battery. The trial court found appellant to be a habitual offender and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony of a police dispatch and of the victim's statements to a police officer. Appellant also maintained that the trial court committed sentencing errors because the trial court included on the guidelines scoresheet a triple assessment of victim injury points for injury to a single victim during a single criminal episode. The court affirmed the trial court's convictions of appellant but reversed the trial court's imposition of life sentences on the life felonies. The court found that the officer's testimony was not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to establish why the officer went to the scene to investigate. The court concluded that it was erroneous for the trial court to make a triple assessment against appellant because victim injury was to be scored according to the number of victims, not the number of counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Wakulla County (Florida), which denied his motion to suppress and entered his conviction for carrying a concealed firearm and possession of less than 20 grams of cannabis. Defendant claimed that a consensual encounter did not proceed a police detention of defendant and that evidence arising from a subsequent arrest was subject to suppression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant consented to an encounter with police, the suppression of evidence arising from a subsequent arrest was properly denied. A homeowner contacted police upon suspicion that someone was trying to break into her home. The homeowner described defendant. Police found defendant walking about one-half mile from the residence and requested to speak to defendant. Defendant agreed to go to the police station. Police searched defendant prior to placing him in the police car and discovered an unloaded gun. Police also discovered a small amount of cannabis in a search incident to the arrest. Defendant pled nolo contendere to the charges brought against him. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because defendant's encounter with the police was consensual, suppression was unwarranted. The search of defendant for weapons was proper because it was undertaken to insure the officers' safety. The discovery of the gun gave rise to a lawful arrest, and the search incident to that lawful arrest yielded admissible evidence. Thus, the trial court properly denied suppression of that evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress and the entry of defendant's possession of cannabis and carrying a concealed firearm convictions. Because defendant voluntarily agreed to accompany police to a police station, a subsequent search for weapons was lawful. An arrest upon discovery of a gun was lawful, and evidence from this arrest was properly discovered. Thus, suppression was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in order to establish a taking, appellee needed only show that appellant's action in recording the reservation map invaded some property right of appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the air pollution statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 403, superseded the nuisance statute under Fla.

The trial court granted the motion, holding that the nuisance statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to put appellees on notice of the conduct prohibited. The trial court specifically declined to refer to common law for a definition of the term &quot;nuisance.&quot; Appellant state sought review, claiming that the statute was constitutional. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the statute did put appellees on notice and was not vague. However, the appellate court found that dismissal was appropriate because an air pollution statute under Fla. Stat. ch. 403 superseded the nuisance statute. Thus, appellant state was estopped from prosecuting appellees under the nuisance statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the prosecution in a criminal case, sought to have overturned the order of the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida) dismissing, on the charges of unconstitutional application, charges against appellee under the Florida Litter Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 403.413.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant charged appellee criminal defendant with violating the Florida Litter Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 403.413, for placing two trucks on a highway right-of-way on a given day. Prior to trial, appellee moved to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds that the Florida Litter Law was unconstitutional insofar as it applied to motor vehicles. The circuit court agreed, and ordered the charges dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the literal reading of the Florida Litter Law permitted prosecution of one who merely exited his motor vehicle on the highway momentarily as well of one who abandoned it alongside the highway. Given that vagueness, the court opined, the statute was unconstitutional. Accordingly, the circuit court's order dismissing the charges against appellant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court's order was affirmed. The Florida Litter Law unconstitutionally punished motorists who momentarily left their cars while stopped along the side of a roadway as well as those who abandoned junk cars along the roadway, and therefore it was overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's order and remanded with directions to deny defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant met with an undercover officer at defendant's apartment, and after examining a kilo of cocaine, the officer claimed he was going to his car to get money, when in fact he left the apartment and signaled backup officers, who entered the apartment and arrested defendant. Defendant argued that the backup officers entered his apartment without consent, and the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress. On review, the court found that where an undercover officer was invited into a residence for the purpose of purchasing illegal drugs and then departed temporarily with the understanding he would return shortly but instead returned with other officers who affected an arrest, both the returning undercover officer and the accompanying officers had an implied consent to reenter the premises. The court distinguished the matter from cases where officers departed an area and came back at some later time after which any period of consent had expired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner landowners sought writ of certiorari to a decision of the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), which denied them certiorari to an administrative order refusing rezoning classification sought by petitioners for their land; which stated that the denial was arbitrary, unreasonable, and had no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, and was not according to the essential requirements of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the appellate court granted the petition for writ of certiorari, quashing the previous denial of certiorari because petitioner landowners had been entitled to rezone their land according to the requested zoning classification. The appellate court determined that the rezoning action in question was judicial, noting that it involved an application of policy to a specific individual and a single parcel of land after a proceeding in which a decision had been made between two distinct alternatives. The appellate court noted that although petitioners met their initial burden of showing that the requested change in zoning was in conformance with the comprehensive plan, respondent commission had failed to give the requisite reasons or findings to support its denial of the rezoning request. The appellate court on remand withheld the writ pending compliance with its opinion, noting that stricter judicial scrutiny of respondent's order was mandated where the challenge was not to the validity of the underlying comprehensive plan or zoning legislation, but to the validity of respondent's action in denying the requested rezoning of discrete parcels of real property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner state appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Escambia County (Florida), which denied petitioner's motion to vacate termination of community control for failure to comply with the victim's notice requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 960.001 (1989). Petitioner also sought a writ of certiorari or mandamus for review of the circuit court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent was convicted of vehicular homicide and sentenced to one year in jail, followed by two years of community control. After 10 months of community control, his participation was terminated. Petitioner state asked the trial court to vacate the modification, contending that the order was illegal because the trial court did not comply with the victim's notice requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 960.001 (1989). Respondent contended that the notice requirements were irrelevant, and that Fla. Stat. ch. 948.05 allowed the court to discharge respondent from community control at any time. The trial court denied the motion to vacate. Petitioner appealed, and the court found it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute. The right of petitioner to obtain appellate review was limited, and of the types of orders that could have been appealed, only an &quot;illegal sentence&quot; was arguably applicable. The sentence originally imposed was legal, however, and petitioner only disputed the termination before completion of the term originally imposed, which was in compliance with Fla. Stat. ch. 948.05. The court denied the petition for writ of certiorari or mandamus and certified questions for review.</SPAN></P>

The petition for writ of certiorari or mandamus was denied where petitioner had not established that a public official had failed to perform a ministerial duty, and questions of great public importance were certified.</SPAN></P>

Appellee's insurance policy stated that appellant would pay reasonable medical expenses within three years of the date of appellee's accident, providing that the coverage was excess over any medical expenses paid or payable under no-fault coverage (PIP). The court held that the three-year limitation period was invalid because Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(4)(f) meant for medical payments coverage to be available as a supplement to PIP to permit the purchase of insurance that would cover 100 percent of the insured's medical bills. Therefore, the court held that a three-year limitation period would defeat the legislative intent in the medical payment statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989) was unconstitutional as depriving him of equal protection of the laws and infringing on the courts power to impose punishment. Appellant also asserted that the classification must be reversed based on the trial court's failure to make findings required by chapter 775.084(1)(a)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contested his sentence as a habitual felony offender. On appeal, the court reversed appellant's sentence. The court held that the trial court's failure to make findings that that the predicate offenses had not been pardoned or set aside, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a)(3) (1989), constituted reversible error even in the absence of an objection. However, the trial court rejected appellant's assertion that chapter 775.084 was unconstitutional. The court held that that the guarantee of equal protection was not violated when prosecutors were given the discretion by law to habitualize only some of those criminals who are eligible, even though their discretion is not bound by statute. Furthermore, the court held that only a contention that persons within the habitual offender class are being selected according to some unjustifiable standard, such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification, would raise a potentially viable challenge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents employer and carrier sought review of an order from the judge of compensation claims (Florida) that awarded benefits to claimant. Respondents contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(13)(d)(4) (Supp. 1990), which mandated workers' compensation coverage for corporate officers in the construction industry, violated equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant, who was a corporate officer in a construction company, was injured while filling in for an absent worker. Claimant had legally exempted himself from coverage under the Florida Workers' Compensation Act (Act), but prior to his injury, the Act was amended, as codified at Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(13)(d)(4) (Supp. 1990), to prohibit officers of corporations engaged in the construction industry from exempting themselves from coverage. A convoluted series of judicial and legislative acts left ch. 440.02(13)(d)(4) as the law applicable to claimant's case, and the court rebuffed respondents' equal protection challenge, held the statute constitutional, and affirmed the order. Noting no suspect classification or fundamental right at issue, the court applied the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The court held that respondents themselves supplied the &quot;reasonable basis&quot; necessary to support the classification, by arguing in their brief that the construction industry in particular had been accused of fraud and premium avoidance schemes that had the potential to put coverage for industry employees at risk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order that awarded workers' compensation benefits to claimant. In doing so, the court held that a legislative classification that prohibited officers of corporations engaged in the construction industry from exempting themselves from workers' compensation coverage did not violate the guarantee of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of burglary of a structure and petit theft and sentenced as a habitual felony offender, pursuant to Fla.

Defendant appealed, claiming that &sect; 775.084 was unconstitutional, the theft sentence was erroneous, and that court costs should not have been imposed because he was not given express notice of such costs. In reversing in part with respect to the one-year sentence for theft, the court ruled that the trial court erred by not conforming to the 60-day sentence that was orally pronounced. In affirming the remainder of the sentencing order, the court ruled that &sect; 775.084 was not void for vagueness and it did not violate equal protection and due process. Moreover, defendant was provided constructive notice of the imposition of costs by the publication of the statute that allowed for costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant individual was convicted of sale or delivery of cocaine and sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender. He contended that 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 280, which amended Florida's habitual felony offender provisions, violated the one-subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court reversed defendant's conviction, remanded for resentencing, and certified as a question of great public importance the issue of whether 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 280 violated the one-subject rule. The single subject rule required that every law embrace only one subject. The act at issue amended statutes pertaining to habitual felony offenders, statutes pertaining to career criminal prosecutions, and statutes pertaining to policies for career criminal cases. It also contained provisions governing repossession of motor vehicles by private investigators. There was not a logical or natural connection between career criminal sentencing and repossession of motor vehicles by private investigators. Because appellant's offense occurred between the effective date of the act and the date when it was re-enacted as a part of the Florida statutes, appellant had raised a viable constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which entered a final summary judgment in favor of defendant dentist in their dental malpractice action. The trial court's summary judgment was based on its ruling that the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations had run before the suit was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the plaintiffs suffered personal injuries caused by the negligence of defendant dentist on January 12, 1987. Plaintiffs' attorney sent a letter to defendant's insurance carrier on August 29, 1988. On January 10, 1987, just two days prior to the expiration of the two year statute of limitations, plaintiffs' attorney sent a letter to defendant by certified mail giving notice of their intent to sue. The lawsuit was filed on July 13, 1989. The trial court held that the August 29, 1988 letter was a notice of intent to sue, so the lawsuit was untimely. Plaintiffs appealed and the court reversed, holding that the August 29, 1988 letter was a nullity and should be disregarded. The January 10, 1987 letter was the notice of intent to sue, and extensions available to plaintiffs beyond that date extended the statute of limitations beyond the July 13, 1989 filing date. The court considered the August 28, 1988 letter under the standards imposed for determining whether such a letter would invoke the statutory tolling provisions. The letter was not in strict compliance with statutory requirements because it was addressed to the insurance company rather than defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of defendant dentist holding that the first letter sent by plaintiffs' attorney could not be considered the notice of intent to sue because it did not comply with the statutory requirement that such notice be sent directly to defendant. The first letter should have been disregarded, making the lawsuit timely based on the second letter and the statutory extension periods.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, state board of accountancy and the department of professional regulation, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida), which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 473.323(1)(1), which prohibited direct solicitations by Certified Public Accountants, and Fla. Stat. ch. 473.317(1), which prohibited providing fee information to prospective clients, were unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Certified Public Accountant (CPA), solicited a prospective client and provided the clients with fee information for his services. Appellants, state board of accountancy and the department of professional regulation, charged appellee with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 473.323(1)(1), which prohibited direct solicitations by Certified Public Accountants, and Fla. Stat. ch. 473.317(1), which prohibited providing fee information to prospective clients. The trial court agreed with appellee's argument that the two statutes were unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. I Free Speech clause. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court held that under the four-part Central Hudson commercial speech test, appellants had an overriding compelling state interest in banning direct solicitation to clients, and that the ban would not violate the U.S. Const. amend I. However, the court determined that prohibiting appellee from giving clients fee information could not prohibited under Central Hudson, because there was no compelling interest in denying clients this information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part, and reversed in part the decision of the lower court and held that state statute, which prohibited direct solicitation of clients, was permissible under the U.S. Const. amend. I , and did not violate appellee's free speech. However, the court determined that state statute, which prohibited appellee giving clients fee information, was unconstitutional because it did not serve any compelling interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, consisting of several corporations holding retail alcoholic beverage licenses denominated in the Florida Administrative Code as consumption on premises licenses, sought review of a judgment by the Circuit Court for Leon County, (Florida) granting appellee summary judgment in appellants' challenge to the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 561.501 (1990 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants took issue with language in Fla. Stat. Ch. 561.501 (1990 Supp.) stating that a surcharge of 10 cents was imposed upon each ounce of liquor and each 4 ounces of wine, and a surcharge of 4 cents was imposed on each 12 ounces of beer sold at retail for consumption on premises licensed by appellees as an alcoholic beverage vendor. The circuit court held that the statute had a rational basis, did not unconstitutionally deny the protection to consumption on premises (COP) licensees, did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, and did not deny due process. The court agreed. The court found that the differences pointed out by appellee between on-premise and off-premise consumption vendors did exist, and the state supreme court had refused to toss out revenue measures simply because seemingly identical items were classified differently for tax purposes depending upon ultimate use, destination, vendor, purchaser and the like. The court found that it was unable to say that it was not a proper legislative prerogative to impose different burdens upon licensees in recognition of the already well-defined historical classification in Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment rejecting appellants' constitutional attack on the statute and held that the legislative enactment placing a surcharge upon liquor, wine, and beer sold at retail for consumption on premises licensed by appellee as an alcoholic beverage vendor satisfied the standards of constitutionality properly applied in the state to a revenue measure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari to review an order that reversed the dismissal of traffic charges against them. The court denied the writ of certiorari. The court rejected petitioners' claim that because the charges were second-degree misdemeanors, their prosecution had to be commenced within one year after the offenses were committed under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.15(2)(d) (1989). Specifically, petitioners claimed that the traffic tickets that they were issued were not charging documents within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.15(5). After examining the statutes, the case law interpreting them and similar statutes and similar traffic crimes, the court ruled that service on the accused of a copy of a properly prepared uniform traffic citation containing a notice to appear and the timely filing of the original and one copy of the traffic citation, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 316.650(3), in the court having jurisdiction over the alleged offense, invoked the subject matter jurisdiction of the court and commenced prosecution of the criminal traffic case for purposes of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a boating accident, defendant was charged with two counts of violation of the navigation rules pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 327.33(3)(a), that the he operated a vessel without maintaining a lookout, and that he improperly conducted a vessel in restricted visibility. The trial court found that ch. 327.33(3)(a) was unconstitutional because it lacked a mens rea requirement, and granted defendant's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the legislature properly disposed of criminal intent because the statute described a crime not prohibited at common law and did not regulate an activity unrelated to its goal of avoiding boat accidents. The court found that ch. 327.33(3)(a) was designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare of vessel operators and other persons using the state's waterways by proscribing a failure to act under circumstances that should alert the operator of the vessel to the consequences of his or her deeds; the statute, therefore, did not violate the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) that granted appellees' motion for summary judgment in appellants' action for a declaratory judgment that restrictions on insurance agents contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 626.988 (1983), were so vague as to render the statute incapable of proper construction, that they violated equal protection and due process, and that the matter was preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rebuffed appellants' challenge to the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 626.988 (1983). The court explained that because the statute regulated economic matters, and because the affected parties were relatively sophisticated, a less restrictive standard for judging vagueness was appropriate. The court noted that most of the language in the statute could be interpreted according to common understanding, and that uncommon terms were defined. The court held that the statute afforded fair notice and gave sufficient guidance to the agency charged with its enforcement. The court held that appellants had failed to establish any facts that supported an equal protection or due process challenge to the law, noting that the grandfather provisions and restrictions it contained had rational bases. The court further held that 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1461 et seq. did not preempt ch. 626.988 as it pertained to savings and loan institutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with second-degree murder with a firearm and unlawful display of a firearm during the commission of a felony. At trial, the state used its peremptory challenge to strike a prospective juror who was black. The defense attorney objected, but did not request the state to demonstrate its justification for striking the juror until after the jury selection. The court did not conduct any hearing, and the jury returned a guilty verdict. On appeal, defendant argued that failure to conduct an inquiry was a reversible error. The court determined that defendant did not make a timely objection when it questioned the use of the peremptory challenge. Furthermore, the court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that there was a strong likelihood that the juror was challenged based solely on his race. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimed ownership of deceased's property on the basis that he was the deceased's illegitimate son. He petitioned the court to adjudicate his paternity, to determine the heirs of the deceased, and to have himself adjudicated a lineal descendant of the deceased.

On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court's order to the extent that facts did not exist to establish virtual adoption, and agreed that virtual legitimation did not exist as a distinct doctrine in Florida law. The court cited Fla. Stat. ch. 732.108(2)(b), which provided that a person born out of wedlock was a lineal descendant of his father if the paternity of the father was established by adjudication before or after the death of the father. The court noted that the trial court did not consider the evidence in terms of the statute, and reversed and remanded for it to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) dismissing a prosecution for removing contraband from a state correction facility in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 951.22 on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to appellee, a newspaper reporter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An inmate passed some pieces of paper with writing on them to appellee, a newspaper reporter. Appellee refused to surrender the papers to a correctional officer and was later arrested and charged with violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 951.22. The trial court found the statute to be unconstitutionally vague, stating that appellant state in enacting an overbroad statute which outlawed all written communications had made wholly innocent conduct the subject of criminal prosecution. On appeal, the judgment was reversed. The court rejected the argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, holding that no person of common intelligence needed to guess at the fact that, when the statute said that one may not receive any &quot;written communication&quot; &quot;from any inmate&quot; &quot;except through regular channels as duly authorized by the sheriff,&quot; it meant just that and that the conduct which formed the basis of appellee's case was unambiguously described by that provision. Further, a reasonable construction of the statute would render mere possession criminal only as to otherwise non-innocent objects, such as letters, only when, as here, they unauthorizedly passed from a prisoner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the dismissal of charges against appellee. The court rejected the argument that the statute was unconstitutional, finding nothing at all in appellee's contention that there was anything vague about the portion of the statute she violated, or that the statute was overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a negotiated plea of guilty, appellant inmate was convicted of two counts of obtaining property by worthless check and one count of witness tampering. The trial court issued a summary denial of his motion for postconviction relief. The appellate court reversed, finding that the record was insufficient to support the ruling of the trial court. Appellant claimed the check charges should have been brought as misdemeanors because they were tendered to extinguish a preexisting debt. The court held that summary denial by the trial court was improper because the record did not show whether appellant freely opted for the plea agreement or whether his counsel failed to recognize a valid defense. The court also held that summary denial of postconviction relief on the witness tampering charge was improper, because the court was unable to determine from the record if appellant pled guilty to an unconstitutional statute. The court remanded with instructions for the trial court to review the record and attach the supporting portions of the record if it again denied appellant's motion, or to conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve these issues.</SPAN></P>

He began receiving retirement benefits from the state retirement system.

Appellant did not personally notify appellee, the state retirement division, in writing of his employment relationship, but continued to receive retirement benefits. During an audit, appellee learned of potential retirement benefit overpayments made and initiated forfeiture proceedings to recover benefits. Appellant defended the claim on the ground that he was an independent contractor. Appellee rejected the finding of the hearing officer that appellant was an independent contractor and ordered forfeiture of some benefits. On appeal, the court found that appellee erred, and that there was substantial competent evidence to support the hearing officer's findings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state excused two black prospective jurors during the voir dire stage of defendant's trial. Defendant's attorney objected to the use of the peremptory challenges on the ground that they were racially motivated.

The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was found guilty of three counts of dealing in stolen property. On appeal, the court held that the abuse of discretion standard was the appropriate standard for review of the trial court's inquiries into the proffered explanations for the use of peremptory challenges. The court determined that in denying defendant's motion to strike the jury panel, the trial judge implicitly concluded that the state's explanations were race-neutral, reasonable, and non-pretextual.
