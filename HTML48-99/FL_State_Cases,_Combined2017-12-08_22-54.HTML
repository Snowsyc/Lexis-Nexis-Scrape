</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the order from the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida), which denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in plaintiff's declaratory action attacking the constitutionally of Fla. Stat. ch. 787.04, and which granted defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff removed his two children out of the country in violation of a court order. Following the issuance of a warrant for plaintiff's arrest, plaintiff filed a declaratory action attacking the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 787.04 on the ground that it was too vague. Both parties filed summary judgment motions. The lower court denied plaintiff's summary judgment motion, but granted defendants' summary judgment motion. Plaintiff filed this appealed. The court agreed with and adopted the analysis of the lower court. The court found that the challenged statute was not unconstitutionally vague simply because the statute afforded an affirmative defense to plaintiff based on his reasonable belief. The juror had the ability to determine the question of reasonable belief, since the reasonableness standard had been sufficiently utilized in several other state criminal statutes and had been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. The court noted that plaintiff's arguments to void the statute also failed because he did not support any of his contentions with sufficient case law. The court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague and affirmed the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the lower court granting defendants' summary judgment motion, finding that the challenged statute, which afforded an affirmative defense to a person criminally charged based on his reasonable belief, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proceedings were instituted by appellee Florida Department of Insurance to liquidate an insurance company under the Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 631.001 et seq. (1993). The trial court entered a partial summary judgment that required that appellants pay appellee, as receiver for the company, a certain amount, plus prejudgment interest. This amount reflected a sum of money the company transferred to appellants after the filing of the original petition for liquidation as compensation for providing legal services on behalf of the company's insureds. On appeal, the court reversed the partial summary judgment because appellants should have been provided the opportunity to rebut the presumption created by Fla. Stat. ch. 631.263 (1993) that they acted in bad faith. The court held that appellants should be allowed to demonstrate that the transfers were made for present fair equivalent value. The court concluded that the trial court's construction of the statute as creating a conclusive presumption that afforded appellants no opportunity for fair rebuttal was clearly in error as a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, manufactured home association challenged an order that denied appellant's petition to declare invalid certain proposed rules of appellee revenue department. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12D-6001 and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12D-6002 imposed an ad valorem tax on mobile homes and appellant argued that such a tax was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the denial of appellant's petition because Fla. Stat. ch. 193.075 (1991) stated that mobile homes which were permanently affixed to land owned by the mobile home owner were not mobile homes for purposes of the constitutional section which prohibited ad valorem taxation of mobile homes. The court also rejected appellant's claim that appellee had exceeded its authority by making the rules because the rules added nothing to the requirements of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nude dance club challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which denied its request for a temporary injunction, holding that appellant failed to show a likelihood of success on appellee county government's regulations requiring that dancers maintain a certain distance from patrons, and building codes dictating the structure of the club that were enacted without notice and a public hearing requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county government enacted an adult entertainment code, which required that nude female dancers maintain a certain distance from patrons, and that adult business abide by appellee's zoning and land-use ordinance. Appellant adult business filed suit against appellee, claiming that the regulations violated free speech, that the regulations were enacted without a proper notice and public hearing, and requested a temporary injunction to prevent enforcement during litigation. The court found in appellee's favor, denied the temporary injunction, and appellant challenged the ruling. The court held that appellant had a heavy duty to show that the regulations were unlawful, and that it would be harmed if a temporary injunction was not granted. The court determined that the regulations did not suppress appellant's free speech rights, and were not vague or overbroad. The court also stated that appellee's building code was not required to have a notice and public hearing because it was not a land-use regulation. The court upheld the denial of the temporary injunction and dismissed appellant's challenge.</SPAN></P>

After appellee's creditors foreclosed on the property, appellee filed a lawsuit against appellant for inverse condemnation, claiming that appellant's actions constituted a taking in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. V. The trial court found that appellant was liable for the obstruction in denying and delaying appellee's building permits, and that the action was not time-barred. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court held that appellant was not liable for the inverse condemnation, because it was appellee's financial difficulties that prevented the hotel from being built, rather than appellant's actions. The court also determined that appellee's action was barred by the statute of limitations, because it failed to file the action within four years of appellant's last act of obstruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Department of Legal Affairs, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which dismissed its action that alleged violations of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee moving company made it a business practice to provide consumers with low-ball price estimates on the phone and tacking on extra charges when the payments became due. Appellant, the Florida Department of Legal Affairs, initiated an action against appellee alleging that such practice violated Fla. Stat. ch. 501.204 (1991) by being an unfair or deceptive practice. The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that there was no specific rule or regulation prohibiting appellee's action. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded the action for further proceedings. A specific rule or regulation was not needed to determine what constitutes an unfair practice under the statute. Appellee's practice did not have to violate a specific rule in order for it to be considered deceptive. Pursuant to Fla.

The appellee that did not pursue an appeal sought to intervene on the ground that it was a party and would be substantially affected by the outcome. The trial court granted appellee's petition.

Stat. ch. 39.464, which allowed appellee Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS), a licensed child-placing agency, or a guardian ad litem to petition for the termination of parental rights did not violate the state's constitutional provision addressing the doctrine of separation of powers because the power to protect children and terminate parental rights was not a power exclusively vested within one branch of government. Thus, the court concluded that the exercise by appellee guardian ad litem of a power, which HRS did not hold exclusively, was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During pretrial proceedings in plaintiff's lawsuit, one the defendants moved the trial court for an order approving ex parte conferences between his counsel and the plaintiffs' treating, nonparty, health care providers. The other defendant joined in the motion. The trial court granted the motion, prohibiting the attorneys from discussing the specific medical condition of the plaintiffs with the doctors. On appeal, the court stated that under Fla. Stat. ch. 455.241(2), the medical condition of a patient could not be discussed with any person other than the patient or the patient's legal representative or other health care providers involved in the care or treatment of the patient. An exception applied upon written authorization of the patient. The court also stated that a person seeking disclosure should have used the statutory method or followed the applicable rule of civil procedure. Since none of the reasons for waiver existed, the trial court erred in entering its order. Protection against disclosure did not require a showing of irreparable harm. Therefore, the writ was granted and the order was quashed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with stalking under Fla. Stat. ch. 784.048 (Supp. 1992). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of ch. 784.048, and the circuit court found it to be facially unconstitutional, dismissing the charge against appellant. The court reversed the decision of the circuit court. The court found that the circuit court failed to apply the proper step-by-step analysis in considering the overbreadth and vagueness of a statute; requiring a reviewing court to first determine whether the statute reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct and then to consider the facial vagueness challenge. Significantly, the court noted that the circuit court failed to consider the alleged conduct supporting the criminal charge against appellant. This was error because a party who engaged in clearly proscribed conduct could not complain about the vagueness of the law as it might apply to others. The court remanded for reconsideration of the constitutional challenge under the proper analysis.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that ch. 806.13(2) passed muster under each of the tests established to determine whether a statute violates the establishment clause.

Stat. ch. 838.021(3)(a). On review, appellant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the corruption by threat against a public servant count because the state charged him with violating the penalty provision of a statute, rather than charging him with the substantive criminal act. The court found that cases cited by the state did not support its contention that ch. 838.021(3)(a) was a crime within itself. Further, the court held that ch. 838.021(3)(a) merely enumerated the penalty imposed for a conviction pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 838.021(1)(a) or (b). Therefore, the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to dismiss was erroneous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit against defendant law enforcement officers under state common law and federal civil rights theories as the result of an alleged false arrest. During the jury trial, defendants moved for a directed verdict based on plaintiff's failure to serve the Department of Insurance (Florida) under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(7) (1989). The trial court granted the motion and entered a final judgment for appellees. Thereafter, appellant sought review of the directed verdict on his federal claims for relief. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that service of process upon the department was not required for a federal civil rights claim. The court explained that the federal claims were not against a state agency under the waiver of sovereign immunity. Instead, plaintiff's claims were against defendants individually for their violation of his civil rights under color of state law. Such a claim was possible prior to the waiver of sovereign immunity and, thus, the court concluded that ch. 768.28(7) did not apply to plaintiff's federal claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which convicted him and sentenced him for possession of cocaine with intent to sell within 200 feet of a public housing facility, and denied his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from a judgment and sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to sell within 200 feet of a public housing facility. After his motion to suppress evidence of the cocaine found in his pants leg by a police officer was denied, appellant pled no contest to the charge, specifically reserving his right to appeal. On appeal, the court concluded that the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing supported the trial court's ruling that the search of appellant was made during a consensual encounter with police officers, and that the search was conducted with his consent. The court, therefore, held that appellant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights were not violated and probable cause was not necessary. The court held that under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 893.13(1)(a)(I)1, possession with the intent to sell was a necessarily included lesser offense of possession with intent to sell within 200 feet of a public housing facility. The court remanded the case with directions to enter a judgment of guilt under &sect; 893.13(1)(a)(I)1, and to resentence him accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of appellant's motion to suppress was affirmed because the evidence adequately supported the trial court's ruling that the search of appellant's person was made during a consensual encounter with police officers and the search was conducted with his consent, and the case was reversed and remanded with directions to enter a judgment of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police department conducted an investigation of an alleged prostitution ring. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 934.09(1)(a), the lower court issued an order authorizing the state to install and use a wiretap device. Appellees were charged with violations of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 895.03(1991). The court granted their motions to suppress the evidence obtained through the use of the wiretap surveillance. On appeal, the key issue was whether the crime of prostitution was a crime dangerous to life, limb, or property and punishable by imprisonment of more than one year such that it fits within the confines of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516(2). The court noted that Florida's wiretap statute had to be read in conjunction with its federal equivalent and if a portion of the Florida law was broader than the federal law, that part of the statute was invalid. Finding that the crime of prostitution was not dangerous to life, limb, or property, the court affirmed the lower court and held that the Federal Legislature preempted the authority of the State of Florida to include the crime of prostitution in its wiretap statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was convicted of first degree murder in 1981. The supreme court vacated his death sentence and ordered a new penalty phase. On remand, respondent attacked the admissibility of victim impact evidence. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(7) (1992) was unconstitutional. The appellate court granted certiorari and quashed the order of the trial court that found the statute unconstitutional. The appellate court held that victim impact evidence clearly was not an aggravating factor in death sentencing, that admitting impact evidence did not reduce the state's burden in the sentencing phase, but rather victim impact evidence was relevant evidence because it informed the jury or court of the particular harm caused. Further, the appellate court held that victim impact evidence was neither aggravating nor mitigating evidence, but was other evidence, not required to be weighed against, or offset by, statutory factors and that amendment of the statute after the crime did not violate ex post facto principles. The appellate court certified the question, of whether or not the statute was constitutional to the state supreme court, as a question of great importance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, appellee landowners sought to develop condominium units, but appellant county informed appellees that permits would not be issued unless they deeded to the county a ten-foot strip of land adjacent to the proposed condominiums. Appellees protested this requirement, but decided to grant the deed to avoid a delay. Following these transactions, the county issued the necessary permits. Thereafter, problems developed and appellees lost any legal interest in the development by a judicial sale in December 1987. Appellees filed this action and maintained that the county ordinances in 1983 did not validly require them to dedicate the property and appellant's actions constituted inverse condemnation. The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of appellees because the longest possible statute of limitations for this case was seven years from the date appellees last possessed the property. Fla. Stat. ch. 95.14 (1991), which governed actions founded on title to real property, or to rents or service from it, barred appellees action because it was filed more than eight years after they transferred title to appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, personal representatives of estate, sought review of decision granting appellees' petition to reopen estate. Appellants argued the trial court misconstrued another case because Fla. Stat. ch. 733.702 (1985) was unconstitutional only when applied to known or ascertainable claimants. In the other case, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 733.702 (1985), which provided a time limit for the filing of claims against a decedent's estate, violated due process and could not, standing alone, serve as a bar to the claims of known or ascertainable creditors. Appellees failed to file a claim against the estate within the claims filing period provided by ch. 733.702. On appeal, the court held the trial court erred in interpreting the other case to permit reopening of the estate. Even if appellees were known claimants, appellees' failure to file a claim before the estate was closed when they had actual knowledge of the opening of the estate made the case inapplicable. Fla. Probate R. 5.495 required that a creditor establish absence of actual knowledge in order to file a claim that would otherwise be barred under ch. 733.702.

Appellants argued that ch. 103.022 violated both the state and federal constitutions because it imposed an unreasonable burden on write-in candidates. The lower court denied the requested declaratory and injunctive relief. The court affirmed and held that appellants failed to demonstrate that the deadline established by the legislature in ch. 103.022 was unreasonable. The court went on to hold that the deadline for write-in candidates did not undermine the U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV rights of minor parties, minor party candidates, or their supporters.

Stat. ch. 838.15 (1990), was found to be unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information charged defendant with 35 counts of commercial bribe receiving, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 838.15 (1990). Defendant moved to dismiss, and the trial court granted the motion, finding that ch. 838.15 was unconstitutionally vague and susceptible to arbitrary application. On appeal, the court found that, when read in its entirely, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the party to whom the law applied had fair notice of what was prohibited. Further, the statute adequately advised persons of common knowledge of what conduct was proscribed. Finally, the court did not find this statute to be susceptible of arbitrary application so as to violate due process because there was a finite list of professions/legal relationships to which the statute applied, and the statute was clearly limited to private industry and commercial transactions. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute was not subject to arbitrary application. Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding ch. 838.15 facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to conduct an adequate inquiry after the state peremptorily challenged three prospective jurors. During the jury selection process, three black members of the venire indicated they had some connection with defendant. The state exercised peremptory challenges against the three individuals, who were the only remaining black members of the venire. Defense counsel timely objected and asked that the state be required to give reasons for the challenges. Defense counsel met its initial burden of showing a strong likelihood that the strikes were racially based. Under the circumstances, the state was obligated to provide a clear and reasonably specific racially neutral explanation of legitimate reasons for the use of its peremptory challenges. The state's reasons could not be accepted merely at face value by the trial court. Although the state's explanation was found to be facially reasonable and race-neutral, the trial court made no determination as to whether the reasons were non-pretextual. The decision was reversed and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of decision upholding constitutionality of appellee city's ordinance regarding live-aboard vessels. The court concluded the state legislature specifically recognized the right of local governments to regulate or prohibit live-aboard vessels. Fla. Stat. ch. 327.60(2)(1983). The ordinance was a zoning regulation within the contemplation of Fla. Stat. ch. 327.60(2)(1983). The standard for evaluating the constitutionality of zoning ordinances was the fairly debatable test. The fairly debatable rule was a rule of reasonableness whether, upon evidence presented, a municipality's action was reasonably based. The test was whether the ordinance served health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public, was open to dispute on grounds that made sense and was fairly debatable. Further, zoning regulations like other municipal resolutions were presumed valid and should not be interfered with by the courts, unless they were arbitrarily applied. The courts should not ordinarily substitute their judgment for that of the legislative body. It was only necessary the ordinance be supported by competent substantial evidence to show the matter was fairly debatable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, Pinellas County (Florida), which convicted him of committing a lewd and lascivious act upon a child under the age of 16 in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04(2) (1991) following defendant's plea of nolo contendere.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of committing a lewd and lascivious act upon a child under the age of 16 in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04(2) (1991). Defendant reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss on the ground that ch. 800.04(2) was unconstitutional. Defendant argued that the victim had a right to privacy and that the right to privacy extended to the right to have consensual sexual intercourse with defendant. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument and affirmed the conviction. The court held that ch. 800.04(2) was constitutional because the rights of privacy granted to minors did not vitiate the legislature's efforts and authority to protect minors from the conduct of others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that convicted defendant of committing a lewd and lascivious act upon a child under the age of 16 where the statute prohibiting such acts was constitutional. Although the victim had consensual sexual intercourse with defendant, the right of privacy granted to the minor did not vitiate the legislature's efforts and authority to protect the minor from the conduct of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, husband and wife, sought damages based on appellee's breach of its duty to use reasonable care in maintaining its premises. The trial court dismissed appellants' complaint on the grounds that the complaint stated a claim for medical negligence, appellants failed to comply with the presuit screening requirements of Fla. Stat. ch.  766.106, and that Fla. Stat. ch. 766.206(2) required that the complaint be dismissed for a failure to comply with the presuit investigation requirements. The court reversed the trial court's order of dismissal and remanded because, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 766.106(1)(a), a claim for medical malpractice was defined as a claim arising out of the rendering of, or the failure to render, medical care or services. From the face of appellants' complaint, the court held that it was apparent that appellants sued appellee for the failure to warn of a dangerous condition or properly maintain a piece of equipment, rather than for breach of some professional standard of care.</SPAN></P>

Appellant state sought review of the dismissal, and the court affirmed the order. The court found that the statute was facially unconstitutional based principally upon U.S. Const. amend. I overbreadth analysis and that the overbreadth of that statute was both &quot;real&quot; and &quot;substantial.&quot; The court held that the statute proscribed expressive conduct which was protected by the U.S. Const. amend.

Appellant then sought review, arguing that increasing his original 40-year sentence to a 50-year sentence was illegal because it penalized him for attacking his original illegal sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant political party candidate objected to being required to pay a statutory filing fee, an election assessment, and a party assessment upon qualifying to seek political office, claiming they were unconstitutional. Candidates who ran as write-in candidates or upon a petition process were exempted from the fees. Upon appeal from the lower court's award of summary judgment in favor of appellee election officials and against appellant, the court held that the designation of a part of the fee to be placed in a trust fund to encourage people to seek statewide elective office was not unconstitutional because appellant could have run as an independent or chosen an alternative means of ballot access. The funding of the trust fund was essentially no different from payment of the filing fees to the state and an appropriation by the state of that sum to the trust fund. The court held the fees were a constitutionally permissible means of regulating access to the ballot, so long as there were alternative means of ballot access.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for the sale of crack cocaine. Defendant then appealed the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief made pursuant to Fla. Rule Crim. P 3.850. Upon review, the court reversed and remanded. The trial court had held that defendant's claim of being improperly treated as a habitual offender was without merit because the offense for which defendant was sentenced occurred prior to the effective date of the habitual offender statute that was later invalidated. The court remanded on this issue for attachment of records substantiating the date of the arrest. The court also remanded on defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Due to missing records regarding a potential alibi witness, the court was unable to affirm the trial court's conclusion that the decision not to call the witness was purely tactical.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered that respondents were permitted to conduct ex parte interviews with the current physicians and health care providers for petitioner patient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the sentence imposed by the Circuit Court for Nassau County (Florida) after he pled guilty to charges of sexual battery, attempted armed robbery, and attempted first degree murder with a firearm, arguing that habitual violent felony offender statute was unconstitutional and that the statute was improperly applied to the attempted murder charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to charges of sexual battery by a person under the age of 18 upon a person 11 years of age or younger, attempted armed robbery, and attempted first degree murder with a firearm. He received a 15-year non-habitual offender for the sexual battery charge and two concurrent 30-year habitual violent felony offender sentences under the latter charges. He challenged the sentences imposed arguing that the habitual violent felony offender statute imposed a constitutionally impermissible sentence and that the statute was improperly applied to the attempted murder charge. In reversing after considering the latter issue, the appellate court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(1)(a) provided that if a firearm was used in a felony of the first degree, the felony was to be reclassified as a life felony. Because the attempted murder charge was a first degree felony, it was not subject to the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court judgement that imposed sentence was reversed, where the circuit court erred in sentencing appellant under the habitual offender statute that provided that if a firearm was used in a felony of the first degree, the felony was to be reclassified as a life felony. The attempted murder charge was a first degree felony and was, thus, not subject to the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the final order of appellee Department of Professional Regulation that revoked appellant's license to practice medicine in the state. Appellant had maintained a license in another state, but practiced medicine in the forum state. Appellant's license had been revoked after the other state's Board of Medical Practice determined that he had engaged in acts of sexual misconduct with teenage patients when he practiced in that state over a decade before its revocation proceeding against him. In the other state, the allegations had to be proven only by the preponderance of the evidence, not by clear and convincing evidence, as was the case in the forum state. Although there was a trend toward the use of the more rigorous clear and convincing standard in most states, due process was satisfied by the preponderance of the evidence standard. There was no basis for second guessing the procedural adequacy of the administrative hearings in the other state. Appellee was also authorized to revoke appellant's license, even though there were appellate proceedings pending in the other state.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had received five distinct sentences for five separate offenses that had to be considered together for purposes of determining the date of his release, even though they were given concurrently. The sentences imposed on appellant for drug-related offenses could not be considered, because they were committed before the effective date of the Conditional Release Program Act, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant negotiated a plea of guilty to five counts of sale of cocaine. The plea specified that appellant would be found a habitual offender. Although the habitual offender statute required that a defendant have two prior felonies before being declared a habitual offender, the record contained a certified copy of only one prior felony that was cognizable under the statute. It was unclear whether a Pennsylvania conviction for receiving stolen property was a felony or misdemeanor. However, this conviction occurred during a window of time when amendments to the habitual offender statute were found to be unconstitutional. A judgment and sentence for misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance could not be used to determine status as a habitual offender. Appellant's attorney made several references to a Florida felony conviction but the record contained no certified copy of that conviction, nor did the scoresheet include points for that conviction. The court reversed appellant's sentence and remanded. Under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1)(a)1 (1993), it was required that appellant be convicted of two felonies. The court remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Dade County (Florida).

Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted trafficking in cocaine in excess of 150 kilograms and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. The trial court rejected defendant's argument that because the state only introduced into evidence eight kilograms of cocaine, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for acquittal. The state had introduced 170 kilograms of cocaine into evidence through representative samples, testimony, and photographs; it was defendant who sought a stipulation to expedite the case. The trial court did not err in refusing to declare that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(2) was unconstitutional. The penalty provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(2), which included mandatory minimum sentences, did not violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Further, the classifications that the mandatory minimum sentences were based on did not violate equal protection. The classification set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(2) applied uniformly to all persons within the class and bore a reasonable relationship to the state's objective of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence and conviction for trafficking in cocaine. The statute under which defendant was sentenced was constitutional. The statute did not violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and the statute did not violate equal protection because the classifications that the mandatory minimum sentences were based on applied uniformly to all persons within the class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 784.048(3) (Supp. 1992) under which he was convicted of aggravated stalking because of threatening phone calls made to his wife and her parents. The trial court rejected defendant's challenge, and defendant sought review. Defendant claimed that the statutory definition of &quot;harass&quot; was vague and created a subjective standard for &quot;substantial emotional distress&quot; and that the statute was overbroad as it could be applied to speech. The court held that the statute was not vague as it gave defendant fair notice of the proscribed activity and that his conduct fell squarely within its reach. The court held that the statute did not create a subjective standard, but was similar to assault statutes that were based on a well-founded fear measured by a reasonable person standard. The court held that defendant could not challenge the statute on the ground that it might be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the court and held that where conduct and not merely speech was involved, the overbreadth of a statute had to not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to its legitimate sweep.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a counterclaim, arguing that Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01, 704.04 (1991) were unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment granting appellee a statutory way of necessity, and it denied the counterclaim. The trial court ordered appellee to pay appellant $ 56,100 as compensation for the easement. The trial court also awarded appellee attorney's fees of $ 10,000 and costs of $ 6,557 under ch. 704.04, because appellant unreasonably refused to comply with the statute. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellee produced ample evidence establishing that the only practical route of ingress and egress was through appellant's property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual and defendant restaurant filed a petition for rehearing. Plaintiff claimed that the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) improperly denied her motion for attorney fees in her slip and fall suit and contended that she was entitled to the fees because defendant unreasonably rejected her offers of settlement brought under Fla. Stat. ch.  768.79(1)(a) (1987), Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061 (1987), and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because plaintiff individual made a good faith offer of settlement under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 (1987) to defendant restaurant in her slip and fall suit, defendant was liable for plaintiff's attorney's fees.

Stat. ch. 45.061 (1987), and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442. Defendant rejected the offers. Judgment for plaintiff was granted. Plaintiff then brought a motion for attorney's fees. The trial court denied the motion. Plaintiff appealed, claiming she was entitled to the fees because defendant unreasonably rejected the offers. At the appellate level, plaintiff moved for a rehearing. The appellate court denied the motion but granted attorney's fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79. Because the trial court failed to find that plaintiff acted in bad faith in making an offer of settlement, the trial court was required to award fees under this statutory section. However, because defendant reasonably rejected plaintiff's offers under Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061 and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442, the denial of fees under those provisions was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried by a jury and found guilty of two counts of sexual activities with a child, two counts of sexual battery on a child under the age of 16 years, three counts of lewd act upon a child, and one count of use of a child in a sexual performance. On review, appellant argued that Fla.

The appellate court rejected appellant's argument and affirmed. Nevertheless, the appellate court certified the question of whether the constitutional right to privacy rendered unconstitutional those portions of Fla.

Plaintiffs brought an inverse condemnation claim, asserting that the aircraft noise from the airport effected a taking of their properties.

The trial court refused to allow defendant's expert to testify, stating that to do so would amend the ordinance. The trial court found that a taking of plaintiffs' property had occurred. The court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred when it excluded testimony of defendant's expert. The ordinance simply gave notice to landowners that aviation noise in the zones was believed to be at certain levels as projected by a federal study. The court, thus, refused to read into the ordinance any presumption of a particular noise level. Because the noise levels were simply projections, it was error to exclude different models of the noise levels.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that noise levels from defendant county's airport effected a taking of plaintiff landowners' property, and the court remanded for a new trial. The trial court erred when it excluded testimony from defendant's expert about the noise levels in plaintiffs' noise zone; such testimony did not amend an existing ordinance because the noise levels specified in the ordinance were simply projections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Okaloosa County (Florida) which found appellant guilty and sentenced him as an habitual felony offender following his plea of nolo contendere to burglary, grand theft and escape, and also sentenced him after revocation of probation. Appellant claimed he should not have been sentenced as an habitual felony offender and that he was entitled to gain time on the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was on probation after serving part of a sentence for a prior crime, pled nolo contendere to burglary and grand theft and burglary of a dwelling and escape, and was sentenced to 10-year consecutive habitual felony offender sentences. Next, the trial court revoked his probation in the earlier case and imposed a 10-year guidelines sentence to be served concurrently with the other sentences with credit for time served. Appellant argued the habitual felony offender sentences were improper and that he was entitled to gain time to be credited against the split sentence imposed after revocation of probation. The appellate court held that appellant was entitled credit against the split sentence for the earlier offense for gain time earned during his probation. The appellate court reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The appellate court found no merit, however, in appellant's argument against his habitual offender sentences and those sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a writ of mandamus contending that the Department of Corrections (DOC) abused its discretion in the award of incentive gain-time earned under a statute declared unconstitutional in Waldrup. The trial court denied appellant's petition. Appellant challenged the decision. The court affirmed as to appellant's basic gain-time award, but reversed as to his incentive gain-time award and remanded. Two issues were raised on appeal: 1) whether the DOC's percentage of conversion of incentive gain-time to work and extra gain-time violated the ex-post facto prohibition or deprived appellant of equal protection of due process of law; 2) whether the DOC abused its discretion by failing to award the maximum amount of work and extra gain-time available to appellant. First, as to the conversion issue, DOC failed to follow the mandate of Waldrup. The DOC's conversion was tantamount to drafting and implementing a new statute and deprived appellant of due process of law. Second, the mere fact that appellant was not awarded the maximum amount of work and extra gain-time available was not necessarily abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a ruling of appellant's basic gain-time award, but reversed as to his incentive-gain-time award and remanded because the department of corrections abused its discretion in a conversion increasing appellant's incentive gain-time award.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 768.31(2)(a) (1991), based on appellee employee's claim against appellant for injuries sustained when appellant's truck hit employee at the project work site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state transportation agency and appellee contractor signed a contract with an indemnification clause for a repaving project. Appellant's truck hit an employee of appellee working on the project. The employee sued appellant for negligence, and appellant filed a third party complaint against appellee for indemnification and contribution, alleging negligence on appellee's part. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss appellant's complaint. On appeal, the court held that because the contract provided that appellee would indemnify appellant for all negligence claims unless appellant was solely negligent, and because appellant's degree of negligence was an issue of fact that could not be decided on a motion to dismiss, appellant stated a claim for indemnification. However, because Fla. Stat. ch. 768.31(2)(a) (1991) precluded contribution unless the parties had a common liability, and because appellee was immune from liability under Florida's Workers' Compensation Act, ch. 440.11(1), appellee was not entitled to contribution. Thus, the court affirmed the order on contribution, reversed it on indemnity, and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

Construction began and progressed unimpeded until a bald eagle's nest was discovered in a tree situated within the project's fourth phase.

Appellant commission created two preservation zones, which prevented appellee from continuing to develop the land. The trial court found that the commission was liable for taking approximately 48 acres and for causing delays that eviscerated the market value of the project. The court found that appellee's property was not inversely condemned. There was no physical taking in this case. Appellee lost neither the right to possess nor convey the affected areas, and further retained the right to use the property in any way that would not disturb the eagles' natural habitat. The government was not possessed of the property. This case was more truly characterized as regulatory takings rather than physical takings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sexual relations with a minor and was charged with statutory rape under Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04(3). He was prohibited from presenting evidence that his minor partner consented because the victim's consent was not a defense to Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04. On appeal, defendant first contended that his privacy rights under the Fla. Const. were violated. The court held that defendant had standing to challenge the statute on the ground that it violated his constitutional rights. Defendant was correct that the statute must demonstrate a &quot;compelling state interest&quot; because an individual's right to privacy was a fundamental right of the Fla. Const. The court concluded that the state's interest in the well being of its children and the dangers of unprotected sexual activity justified the state in exercising more control over the sexual conduct of children. Defendant also contended that he was denied due process because the statute established a conclusive presumption that a minor could not consent, which relieved the prosecution of its burden of proof. The court disagreed, holding that sexual activity with a minor was an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the trial court erred in allowing appellant's jury to remain in the courtroom during the taking of testimony in the co-defendant's case. However, the court affirmed because appellant's attorney did not object. The court held that the lack of specific objection constituted a waiver of the issue on appeal.

Appellants also challenged the required administrative procedure under ch. 120.68 as an unconstitutional denial of access to the courts. The court dismissed the appeal and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68(15) was a common sense requirement to put on evidence in a trial-like forum, rather than merely create an administrative record, as a prerequisite to appellate review. The court found that the statute presented no constitutional problems and was not a denial of access to the courts, and that such a procedure was ultimately more expeditious than other procedures and did not diminish judicial authority to remedy any wrong.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 794.011(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment and sentences imposed after he pled no contest to and was adjudicated guilty of three counts of attempted sexual battery on a child under 12, a lesser-included offense under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2). Defendant had moved for postconviction relief, which was denied; he then sought a belated review of his denied request to withdraw his plea. Although defendant requested an improper remedy, the court, under Fla. R. App. P. 9.040(c) and Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(a), treated his appeal properly as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Defendant asserted that one of the sentences was illegal as the count for which it was imposed charged a statutory violation not in existence at the time of the offense. The court reversed the judgment as to the count of attempted battery on a child under 12, under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2), holding that defendant could not be convicted, even though he pled no contest, as the statutory offense for which he was charged did not exist at the time of his crime, and so a prima facie showing of the elements of the crime charged could not be made.

The court was unwilling to reach the conclusion that the motion for disqualification was untimely. However, the court concluded that respondent comptroller properly denied petitioner's motion to disqualify. Petitioners' motion for disqualification was exceptionally general in the allegations of bias and prejudice. It failed to allege specific facts to objectively establish a sufficient ground for bias and prejudice, and was not facially sufficient. Petitioners failed to show any connection between their cessation of campaign support and the commencement of regulatory proceedings against them. The alleged connection was too speculative to require disqualification of the agency head.

Appellant argued that the hate-crime statutes were both facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied. No facts regarding the offenses were placed on the record at the plea hearing, and appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere without reservation of the right to appeal. At the sentencing hearing, appellant's counsel had asked that imposition of sentencing be delayed so that she could file a motion attacking the enhancement of the sentence under Fla.

Relying on binding precedent, the appellate court rejected appellant's claims that the statutes were unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the sentences because the argument that reversal was required because the statute was unconstitutional as applied was not raised below and was, therefore, not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff worker sustained severe job-related injuries when he fell through an opening in the floor at a construction site. He received workers' compensation benefits. Plaintiff filed a civil action against defendants, the job superintendent and general contractor president, alleging that each failed to provide adequate job site safety which could have prevented the accident and which amounted to negligent conduct that overrode workers' compensation immunity. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, based upon Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1)(1989), but vacated its order on rehearing after the immunity provisions of that statute were held unconstitutional by the appellate court in another case. Defendants sought review of the order vacating summary judgment. The appellate court, acknowledging that the Florida Supreme Court had reversed its prior declaration of unconstitutionality in another case, concluded that under the applicable culpable negligence standard, there was no question of fact that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law and the trial court was directed to reinstate its order granting summary judgment for defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that under the culpable negligence standard there was no question of fact to be determined and that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court, vacating its original order granting summary judgment for defendants, was reversed and the trial court was ordered on remand to reinstate the order granting summary judgment for defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) denying the motion by appellant's court appointed counsel for an order requiring appellee county to compensate him without his having to file a statement of claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an indigent defendant, was acquitted of aggravated battery and his court appointed counsel sought compensation. The trial court entered an order requiring appellant's counsel, as a condition precedent to receiving payment for his services in representing appellant, to file a statement of claim which could be enforced against appellant as a lien pursuant to a county ordinance. Appellant argued that the ordinance conflicted with Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56 (1991), which did not permit a claim or lien to be created against an indigent defendant who was acquitted. The court reversed the trial court and directed that upon remand the statement of claim be expunged from the county public records. The court held that the legislature had acted affirmatively to exclude acquitted defendants, and the county could not permit what the legislature had excluded, namely the assertion of a lien against an acquitted defendant for special counsel fees. To do so was inconsistent with general law and thus unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inmate was convicted of two counts of attempted first degree murder with a deadly weapon, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; defendant was sentenced to 27 years in prison. Defendant was granted reductions of his sentence because of prison overcrowding, and defendant was released from prison after having served a little less than seven and one half years. The attorney general subsequently determined that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 944.277(1)(i) (1992), defendant had not been eligible for the provisional credits because he was convicted of attempted first degree murder. The corrections department took defendant back into custody, and defendant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. The court denied the petition. An inmate who had been released from prison could be recommitted if his sentence had not yet expired. Moreover, Fla. Stat. ch. 944.277 (1)(i) was enacted prior to defendant's release, and it was not unconstitutional to retroactively cancel defendant's provisional credits. The attorney general had not erred in his statutory construction when he determined that the statute applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then appealed his conviction, and the court affirmed the judgment and sentence of two years of probation and 30 nights in county jail. The court explained that under the Florida Hate Crimes Statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.085 (1991), the penalty for violating Fla. Stat. ch. 790.19 was reclassified from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony. Defendant had asserted in the trial court that ch. 775.085 violated the Free Speech and Due Process Clauses of both the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, after denial of his motion to dismiss, defendant argued that ch. 775.085 was unconstitutionally vague. In affirming the lower court, the court cited prior caselaw upholding the constitutionality of ch. 775.085 against challenges based on vagueness, overbreadth, and First Amendment grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner lost a significant amount of gain time when a revised law went into effect and was applied to appellant's record by appellee prison official. Appellant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus and alleged that the application of the new law was an unconstitutional ex post facto application of law. The trial court denied appellant's petition and appellant sought review. The court reversed and remanded for a redetermination of basic gain-time forfeited by appellant following an escape and escape conviction. The court noted that appellant met both elements for a finding that a penal law was ex post facto. First, the court noted that the application of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.275 (1983) to appellant was retrospective because it applied to events occurring before its enactment. Second, the court held that the law disadvantaged appellant because it resulted in his forfeiture of more gain time than he would have forfeited under the version of the statute in force at the time of his escape and escape conviction. The court noted that habeas corpus relief was not appropriate, treated appellant's petition as a request for a writ of mandamus, and granted the writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of a final summary judgment of the Circuit Court for Madison County (Florida) invalidating its 1989 and 1990 ordinances that levied special assessments for various services provided by appellant county and ordering appellant county to refund monies paid by county residents. Appellee individual cross-appealed the dismissal with prejudice of his claim seeking recovery under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged the summary judgment, which invalidated its ordinances levying special assessments for various services and which ordered it to refund the collected monies. Appellee individual cross-appealed the dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. The court affirmed the summary judgment, holding that appellant county failed to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 125.01(1)(q)2 (1989), the statute expressly named in the ordinances as the authority for their adoption. The court reversed the ruling that the charges levied were not special assessments but instead were taxes for the general benefit of the county and, therefore, violated general law and the constitutional homestead provisions. The court concluded that whether the alleged special assessments conferred special benefits upon the property assessed presented mixed questions of law and fact, precluding summary judgment. The court also reversed that part of the lower court's judgment ordering a refund because there had been no determination of feasibility. The dismissal of appellee individual's civil rights claims was also reversed, to give him an opportunity to amend his complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), convicting and sentencing appellant for kidnapping, sexual battery, and forgery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment convicting appellant of kidnapping, sexual battery, and forgery but reversed and remanded for resentencing. The court concluded that appellant was improperly classified as an habitual offender under an unconstitutional version of the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(b)(1)(1989), which permitted habitualization based on out-of-state felony convictions. The prior constitutional version of the statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1988), required two prior Florida felony convictions to classify a criminal defendant as a habitual offender. The record showed that appellant was habitualized based on two prior Michigan felonies. The same sentence could not have been imposed under the prior constitutional version of the statute and, therefore, resentencing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of kidnapping, sexual battery, and forgery in all respects except for the sentencing of appellant as an habitual offender. The court remanded for resentencing because appellant's prior out-of-state felony convictions did not establish a valid basis for classification as an habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) after they pleaded nolo contendere to possession of cocaine, possession of cannabis, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendants reserved the right to appeal the court's denial of their motion to suppress evidence that was obtained by randomly intercepting and listening to defendants' private conversations emanating from a cordless telephone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that plaintiff, the State of Florida, could use evidence that was obtained by the police who randomly intercepted and listened to private conversations emanating from defendants' home over a cordless telephone. Defendants challenged the ruling denying their motion to suppress. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that such conversations were protected by the state constitution. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that defendants had neither a subjective nor a reasonable expectation of privacy in the conversations because they took place over a cordless phone. The court concluded that the random interception of a cordless phone communication, without sufficient cause or suspicion, constituted an unreasonable interception of a private communication in violation of Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. The court determined that Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 provided for a strong right of privacy, much broader in scope than that of the federal constitution. The court held that under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, a person's private conversations over a cordless telephone were presumptively protected from government interception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of defendants' motion to suppress was reversed and remanded. The act of randomly intercepting and listening to defendants' private conversations emanating from their home over a cordless telephone violated defendants' expectation of privacy, as protected under the state constitution. Defendants' belief in privacy of the telephone calls in question was not spurious or false.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the trial court's decision that found appellant accounting firm liable to appellee for violations of state and federal securities law. Appellant arranged for the sale and audit of an electronics company to appellee, but it did not disclose to appellee an arrangement that appellants had with the electronics company giving appellants a contingency fee based upon the sale price. The court affirmed and rejected appellant's argument that it was not an agent of the electronics company. Use of the Fla. Stat. ch. 517.021 definition of an agent would not have been in keeping with the legislative purpose of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 517, which was to protect the public from fraudulent practices in the sale of securities. Appellants would escape liability if the common law definition of agency were not used. Appellant's agreement with the electronics company to represent the company's interests was substantial evidence that appellant was acting as an agent/broker in a sale of securities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant park owners sought review of a final judgment from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which held Fla. Stat. ch. 723.033 (1991) to be constitutional in their declaratory judgment action regarding the Florida Mobile Home Act and denied their request for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988; appellees, state agency and federation, sought cross-review of the decision declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 723.061(2) (1991) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court affirmed, holding that substantial evidence supported the trial court's findings regarding the constitutionality of the challenged provisions. The appellate court agreed that Fla. Stat. ch. 723.033 (1991) was constitutional, as the statute, which prohibited unreasonable rent increases, was a reasonable legislative attempt to balance the interests of mobile home owners and appellant park owners in the context of their unique economic relationship. The appellate court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 723.033(3), when read in pari materia with other statutory subsections, did not constitute a &quot;conclusive presumption&quot; and was to be interpreted as directory, rather than mandatory. The appellate court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 723.061(2) (1991) was unconstitutional as an impermissible taking of property without compensation, noting that the statute effectively coerced appellants to surrender indefinitely their rights to possess and to occupy their land and to exclude others. The appellate court concluded by holding that appellants had been properly denied attorney's fees and denied their motion for appellate attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the decision in appellant park owners' declaratory action regarding the Florida Mobile Park Act; the statutory section that was unconstitutional had provided for a regulatory scheme regarding appellants' duties in effecting a change in land use that did not substantially advance a legitimate state interest, but instead served to act as an impermissibly regulatory taking of appellants' property without compensation.</SPAN></P>

Code, to implement the guide. Appellant association of injured workers contended that the rule was invalid. The Division of Administrative Hearings upheld the rule. On appeal, the court affirmed. The removal of loss of range of spinal motion from the impairments list was proper because the loss of such range was not a permanent impairment as required for inclusion. Appellant failed to show that the rule was unconstitutional on its face. Appellant also did not establish that the failure to adopt the rule within 180 days of the effective date of ch. 440.15(3)(a)3 was harmful error or that any deficiencies in the accompanying economic impact statement rendered the proceedings unfair.</SPAN></P>

He alleged three separate grounds to substantiate his claim that the sentence was illegal, all of which were rejected by the court on appeal. While the court affirmed the lower court, it discussed appellant's second ground for relief, based on the claim that the trial court erred in sentencing him for a first-degree felony, contrary to the express provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 812.13(2)(a), 775.082(3)(b) (1981), which he argued allowed only a 30 year term. However, the court noted, under those provisions, the armed robbery sentence could be for such term or for a term not to exceed life imprisonment. Due to conflicting case law in the fourth district's own decisions, however, the court certified the issue for review on the sentence for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 365.16(1)(a) (1991). Petitioner argued, inter alia, that the statute under which she was charged was facially unconstitutional as an infringement upon U.S. Const. amend. I guarantees of free speech, and as impermissibly overbroad and subject to misapplication. Upon review, the court denied the petition for writ of certiorari. The court held that ch. 365.16(1)(a) did not infringe upon U.S. Const. amend. I guarantees of free speech, nor was the statute impermissibly overbroad. The court held that the constitutional infirmities of the previous version of this statute were cured by the inclusion of language clarifying that only obscene calls intended to harass a listener, at a location where he enjoys an expectation of privacy were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) judgment convicting him of passing a state lottery ticket with the intent to defraud, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 24.118(c) (1991), arguing that his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of passing a state lottery ticket with the intent to defraud, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 24.118(c) (1991), after his arrest following an attempt to redeem stolen lottery tickets. After his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied, defendant appealed. The court held that although the statute in question was poorly drafted, it was not necessary to hold the statute unconstitutionally vague to reverse the conviction; rather, the court found that because the statute in question was penal in character, strict statutory construction rules had to be followed. Because the specific provision under which defendant was charged did not criminalize the simple act of redeeming a prize-winning lottery ticket that the presenter knew to be stolen, the court held that defendant's motion should have been granted and reversed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the lower court's judgment, holding that strict statutory construction rules had to be applied to the statute in question because it was penal in character, such that defendant's actions without proof of more intent were not in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held Fla. Stat. ch. 63.042(3) (1991), which prohibited adoptions by homosexuals, was unconstitutional. Prospective adopter appellees had voluntarily disclosed to appellant Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services that they were homosexual. On appeal, the court held appellees failed to establish that the legislature lacked the constitutional power to make the public policy decision embodied in the statute. Appellant reasonably construed the statute to apply only to applicants known to engage in current, voluntary homosexual activity. Precise anatomical language was not required in the statute in order for a person of common understanding and intelligence to appreciate the nature of the covered activity. The statute did not violate the Florida constitutional right of privacy because it did not establish a governmental intrusion into a person's private life. It barred the statutory privilege to adopt a child only for a known homosexual applicant. The court concluded that appellees established no right to strict scrutiny and had not established that the statute failed the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed the administrative order rescinding the fence permits previously granted to appellant land owners. The appellate court determined that the absolute ban against fences on Big Pine Key in Monroe County, Florida, Land Development Reg. &sect; 9.5-309 was not narrowly tailored to achieve the state's objective of protection the Key Deer through the least restrictive alternative. The appellate court noted that appellee state agency's own expert established in his testimony the impropriety of a blanket prohibition on fences and the beneficial nature of some fencing. Accordingly, the appellate court held that the fence regulation was facially unconstitutional, noting that the fence ban did not recognize the individual's right to protect, to enjoy, and to use his or her property. The appellate court concluded that, under the facts of the case, fencing was permissible, noting that the ecological and environmental preservation concerns had to yield to the possible danger to children's lives on their own property if the fencing was not used.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of shooting into an occupied vehicle, armed robbery, attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, and three counts of aggravated assault. At trial, defendant contested only the charge of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. Likewise, on appeal he sought review only of his conviction on that charge. He raised numerous issues on appeal, three of which the court addressed. The court found that the statute that defendant was convicted under was not unconstitutionally vague and that defendant's argument that the statute violated the rationality requirement of the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions was not preserved for appellate review. The court also found that because there was no such offense as attempted second-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to give an instruction on that nonexistent offense as a lesser-included offense of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. Thus the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because defendant's arguments that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and violated the rationality requirement of the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions and that the denial of a requested jury instruction on attempted second-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, as a lesser-included offense of that charged, constituted reversible error lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Dade County (Florida) denying its motions for costs and attorney's fees and a non-final order adjudicating Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 and 45.061&nbsp;unconstitutional. Plaintiff insureds cross-appealed the denial of their motion in limine to exclude collateral sources of income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insureds filed an action against defendant insurer for uninsured motorist benefits. Plaintiffs moved in limine to exclude any evidence that plaintiff wife's lost time at work was paid by her employer through the depletion of vacation and compensation time, but the trial court denied the motion. The jury awarded damages to plaintiffs, which the trial court reduced by the amount of a settlement that plaintiffs received from the underlying liability insurer. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for costs and attorney's fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 and 45.061. The trial court denied defendant's requests and found the statutes unconstitutional. Both parties appealed. The appeals court reversed the damage award and remanded for recalculation of the claim for wage loss. The court ruled that plaintiff wife's sick leave time was a collateral source under Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7372, because it was a wage continuation plan or other system intended to provide wages during a period of disability. However, the court ruled that annual leave and compensatory leave were not collateral sources under the statute because an employee can use annual or compensatory leave for other purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the constitutionality of the attorney's fees and costs statutes, but ruled that only plaintiff wife's sick leave time, and not her annual or compensatory time, was a collateral source under the motor vehicle statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of a felony and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Shortly after his release from prison, appellant applied for and was granted a private investigator's license. In 1991, the legislature tightened the qualifications for a private investigator's license. An amended statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 493.6118(4), commanded a state agency to revoke a license for conduct which was not disqualifying when the license was issued. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 493.6118(4), appellee department of licensing revoked appellant's private investigator's license. When appellant's license was revoked, his civil rights had not been restored. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, arguing that the issuance of the license created a vested right, or that the license itself was a property right. The appeals court affirmed the revocation. The court held that retroactive application of Fla. Stat. ch. 493.6118(4) was not unconstitutional, because a private investigator's license was not a property right. The court also held that the legislative determination, that a great public interest was served by denying the license to a convicted felon, was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch.  120.57 (1989) and Fla. Stat. ch. 120.56 (1989), of rules promulgated by appellee Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. The rules froze the rates for Medicaid reimbursement to appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to state-wide budgetary shortfall, the state administrative commission froze nursing home Medicaid reimbursement rates pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 216.221(2) (1989). Appellant nursing homes challenged the rules implementing that decision, which were promulgated by appellee Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. In ruling for appellee, an administrative hearing officer (HO) determined that, although Fla. Stat. ch. 216.221 had been held unconstitutional, that case did not apply because it had been decided after appellee's adoption of the rules. On appeal, the court held that the case declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 216.221&nbsp;unconstitutional was not limited to prospective application, and that the court was required to apply the law in effect at the time of its decision, rather than the law prevailing at the time the judgment was rendered below. Because Fla. Stat. ch. 216.221 (1989) was unconstitutional, the court found that appellee lacked the constitutional authority to promulgate the rules. Therefore, the court reversed the HO, struck the rules, and directed appellee to reinstate the Medicaid rates in the amount to which appellants were entitled before the freeze took effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the administrative hearing officer and directed appellee Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to reinstate the prior Medicaid rates for appellant nursing homes because appellee lacked the constitutional authority to promulgate the challenged rules.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute lacked a clear legislative mandate that failure in this one obligation alone should result in termination of rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Both refused to take a blood alcohol test and their drivers' licenses were suspended as a consequence. Upon formal review of the suspensions, a hearing officer determined that sufficient evidence existed to sustain the suspensions. The state department of highway safety and motor vehicles petitioned the court for certiorari review of the lower court's decision that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.261 and 322.2615 were unconstitutional because they effected a forfeiture of a property right without due process of law. The court granted the writs. The court found that the lower court failed to apply the correct rule of law in arriving at its decision. Further, the court had recently confirmed the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 322.261 and 322.2615 in other decisions. The court found that state procedure for suspending respondents' driving privileges for their failure to take blood alcohol tests was prompt, fair, and meaningful. Thus, the process met the requirements of due process and was facially valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which convicted and sentenced appellant on multiple counts of robbery and aggravated assault of a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to being convicted of incidents related to armed robberies and a high speed chase with police, appellant argued that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on an element of the crime of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. However, following controlling case law, the court held that appellant's failure to raise the issue at trial waived his right to challenge the matter and that, nonetheless, the knowledge of a victim's status as a police officer was not an element of the crime of attempted murder of a police officer. The court then held that the trial court did not violate double jeopardy provisions by reclassifying appellant's aggravated assault charges from third to second degree felonies and then sentencing appellant as a habitual offender. The court reasoned that the statute allowing the increase in the degree of the crime constituted a separate substantive offense combining the elements of assault with the victim's status as a police officer. The court then held that the trial court's written sentence imposed upon appellant was improper. Thus, the court remanded the case for correction of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions were affirmed, but his case was remanded for sentencing because the written sentence deviated from the oral sentence that was imposed.</SPAN></P>

It did not matter that the county's voters had voted for the amendment, if the form of the question was unclear. The question clearly addressed two separate sections of the county charter by combining the proposed creation of a citizen review board with a proposed status change of three independent constitutional offices. Case law demonstrated that the constitutional single question provision applied to nonconstitutional questions, and statute and the Florida Constitution allowed application of the rule to ballot questions on county charter amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission, approved a development order pertaining to appellant developer's property, and appellant sought review. Appellant claimed that the order imposed certain conditions that were unconstitutionally restrictive and violated constitutional provisions protecting private property. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the conditions in the development order were designed to make the project compatible with surrounding residential areas and were not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court was asked to review the propriety of an initial zoning enactment and comprehensive rezoning affecting a large portion of the public. The court characterized the action as legislative. As a result, the standard for review by the court was limited to determining whether the imposition of the objected to conditions was unreasonable and arbitrary. The court concluded that the conditions imposed appeared to be rationally related to maintaining a residential feel and atmosphere for the project and were not unreasonable and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) that imposed judgment and sentences upon appellant for his offenses of arson and violation of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of arson and violation of his probation. He challenged the judgments and sentences imposed upon him for the offenses. The court affirmed the judgments and the sentence for probation. However, it reversed the habitual violent felony offender sentence imposed on the arson case because, according to state law, appellant's case fell into a time period affected by 1989 amendments. The Florida Supreme Court had held that those 1989 amendments to Fla. Sta. ch. 775.084 violated the single subject rule of the Florida Constitution, art. 3, &sect; 6. Resentencing was required of defendants who had committed their offenses between October 1, 1989, and May 2, 1991. Appellant's arson charge occurred on March 6, 1991; thus, he fell within the time frame affected by the 1989 amendments. The trial judge had sentenced appellant as a habitual violent offender based upon an earlier conviction for aggravated battery. Appellant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing, and the court reversed his sentence and remanded for the hearing to take place. The court noted that appellee state would then have the opportunity to prove that appellant otherwise met the requirements of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state reversed the trial court's order, which sentenced appellant as a habitual violent felony offender sentence for his arson conviction where the date of appellant's arson conviction place him within the framework of cases affected by amendments to a state law which the Florida Supreme Court held were unconstitutional; appellant was, therefore, entitled to a new sentence hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, car manufacturer and dealer, sought review of that portion of an order from the Division of Administrative Hearings (Florida) concluding that Fla. Admin. Code R. 15C-1.008 was not an invalid exercise of authority delegated to appellee agency by the state legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Fla. Stat. ch. 320.642 (1989) (Ch. 320.642), appellee department could deny a car dealer license if a party with standing protested and the applicant did not show that existing franchised dealers offering the same line of cars were not properly servicing the territory. Appellants, car manufacturer and dealer, challenged Fla. Admin. Code R. 15C-1.008 (R. 15C), designed to implement ch. 320.642, because it allowed appellee's director to determine these issues and issue a license for only a year. Appellants argued that since ch. 320.642 did not impose this time limit, appellee had no authority to make and enforce R. 15C. Appellants sought review of a ruling adverse to their challenge. The court found that under Fla. Stat. ch. 320, appellee was authorized to administer the provisions of the statute and adopt rules as it deemed necessary and proper for the administration thereof. The court found that R. 15C was reasonably related to the purposes of ch. 320.642 as a means to prevent overloading of a market area with more dealers than could be legitimately justified. Given changing demographics and market data, the time limit was justified. Accordingly, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order determining that appellee department had authority to set time limits in administering and enforcing a statute for determining an award of automobile dealer licenses was affirmed. The statute authorized appellee to make rules necessary for the enforcement of the statute, and appellee's rule limiting the term of dealership licenses was reasonably related to the legislative purpose of the statute in avoiding market saturation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed this medical malpractice action within two years after discovering that he had acquired the HIV virus from a blood transfusion during open-heart surgery six years earlier. He alleged that appellees knew of the substantial risks of contracting the deadly disease from the procedure but negligently failed to obtain his informed consent before transfusion or obtain blood from his relatives, as he had requested. The trial court dismissed the complaint on a finding that the action was barred by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.11(4)(b), the four-year medical malpractice statute of repose. Appellant argued on appeal that the statute was unconstitutional because it barred access to courts for causes of action before the causes accrued. The court, however, affirmed on the authority of recent state supreme court cases that upheld the constitutionality of the statute. Those cases held that the statute of limitations represented a legislative determination that there had to be an outer limit beyond which suit could not be instituted in order to hold down costs of professional liability insurance, and that such bar applied even if the cause did not accrue before the repose period expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of appellant's medical malpractice action was affirmed because the court agreed that the four-year statute of repose barred the action even though appellant filed suit within two years of discovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that convicted him upon a jury verdict of kidnapping, battery, and sexual battery under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011 (1989), and sentenced him as a habitual violent offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(b) (Supp. 1988), although he had no felony convictions in Florida. Defendant challenged the admission of photographic evidence and the prosecutor's closing remarks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took his victim to his home and forced her to engage in sexual acts. As a result, a jury convicted defendant of kidnapping, battery, sexual battery in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011 (1989), and use of drug paraphernalia, and the trial court sentenced defendant as a habitual violent offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(b) (Supp. 1988). On appeal, the court held that because the photographs taken of the crime scene and of defendant at the time of his arrest corroborated the victim's testimony and helped explain her fear of defendant, the photographs were properly admitted. Because ch. 794.011 (1988) outlawed the penetration of any object into the vagina, the coerced insertion of the victim's finger into her own vagina was sexual battery Because the prosecutor's closing remarks were on the absence of defense evidence generally, they were not an impermissible comment on defendant's right to remain silent. Because ch. 775.084(1)(b) (Supp. 1988) did not require a Florida felony conviction, defendant's Kentucky felony convictions were sufficient to have him sentenced as a habitual violent offender. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed convictions for kidnapping, battery, and sexual battery, and the sentence, because the victim's coerced insertion of her finger into her vagina was sexual battery, the photographs were properly admitted to corroborate the victim's testimony, the prosecutor's closing remarks were permitted as a comment on the lack of defense evidence in general, and defendant's Kentucky felony convictions made him a habitual violent offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida) to dismiss the charge of driving with a suspended driver's license causing death or serious injury, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(3) (1991), against defendant, as well as a decision that found the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the dismissal of a charge against defendant for driving with a suspended driver's license causing death or serious injury, a third degree felony. In dismissing the charge, the trial court found Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(3) (1991), the charging statute, to have been unconstitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal and affirmed the trial court's finding that this statute was unconstitutional. The court held that simple negligence, the standard of culpability under this statute, was a nebulous test and that because it would be difficult to ascertain what was necessary to meet such a test, the statute lent itself to selective enforcement, thus making it unconstitutionally vague. Additionally, there was, according to the court, no causal connection between the status of a person's driving privileges and a subsequent injury. Therefore, simple negligence could not be used to bootstrap a misdemeanor into a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of charges against defendant, and affirmed their finding that the statute under which defendant was charged with driving with a suspended driver's license causing death or serious injury was unconstitutionally vague and could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of an order entered by the County Court for Broward County (Florida). It entered an order that dismissed an information charging defendant with engaging in a lewd act in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(3) (1991). The order also found this section unconstitutional. The trial court had certified questions to the appellate court regarding the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, employed as a stripper, was charged with engaging in a lewd act in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(3) (1991). The county court dismissed an information charging defendant with the aforementioned crime, finding the statute unconstitutional. The state challenged the decision, and the county court certified questions to the appellate court on the constitutionality of the statute. The appellate court found the statute constitutional and reversed the trial court's dismissal of the information. The court found that the word &quot;lewdness&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. It also found that the statute was gender neutral. The appellate court further ruled that it did not violate the right of privacy because it served a compelling state interest in eliminating prostitution through the use of the least intrusive means available. Finally, the court found that the statute did not violate the single subject requirements of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The statute's title was sufficiently broad to connect it with the general subject matter of the enactment, and that it did not violate the single subject rule simply because it embraced prostitution, lewdness, and assignation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reinstated the information charging defendant with the crime of engaging in lewd conduct. The appellate court also answered the certified questions in the negative, finding that the lewdness statute was constitutional. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee attorney allegedly attempted to solicit legal representation of a hospital patient. Appellee was charged with three violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(8) &amp; (9) (1991) and Fla. Stat. ch. 877.02(1) &amp; (3), which provided for criminal penalties for solicitation of business for the purpose of filing motor vehicle tort claims or claims for personal injury protection benefits. Appellee filed a sworn motion to dismiss under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4). He claimed that the facts alleged by the state in the information did not constitute a crime. Thereafter, the state filed a traverse pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(d). The trial court granted the motion to dismiss the pending criminal charges finding that each of the counts failed to allege a crime. The court reversed and remanded the order holding that the trial court erred procedurally and substantively in granting appellee's motion. First, upon the state's filing a sworn traverse, the trial court should have denied the motion to dismiss. Second, the trial court erred in determining that the facts alleged in the state's information, if taken as true, failed to make out a prima facie case that appellee had committed a crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state parole commission planned to release two inmates pursuant to its prison control release policy. Appellants, the state and the crime victims of the inmates, sought emergency orders prohibiting appellee from taking any further actions toward the release of the inmates. The trial court denied the petitions and appellants sought review and challenged appellee's application of control release procedures to set a control release date. Appellant argued that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.001 was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 9, which provided that repeal or amendment of a criminal statute would not affect prosecution or punishment for any crime previously committed. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 921.001 was not a criminal statute in the classic sense, because it did not define a particular crime, classify a particular crime in terms of seriousness, or set out the punishment for a particular crime. The court held that appellants failed to demonstrate any violation of the Florida Constitution and affirmed the trial court's denial of the petitions for writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment from the County Court for Volusia County (Florida), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charges for violation of Department of Natural Resources' Rule 16N-22 on the ground that it was unconstitutionally vague. The county court certified the constitutionality question as being an issue of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act, Fla. Stat. 370.12(2) (1991), the department of natural resources promulgated Department of Natural Resources Rule 16N-22.03(1), which provided that any person who violated motor boat speed rules would be guilty of a second degree misdemeanor. Defendant was cited for violating the manatee slow speed zone in violation of Department of Natural Resources Rule 16N-22.012. The appellate court reversed and remanded the trial court's order, which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charges on the ground that Rule 16N-22 was unconstitutional as being impermissibly vague. The court concluded that the trial court misapplied the void for vagueness doctrine because review of the rule revealed that a person of common intelligence would not need to guess as to whether he violated the boat speed regulations. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that defendant only had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and rules that pertained to the area in which he was cited for speeding. The court answered in the negative the trial court's certified question as to whether the rule was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered in the negative the trial court's certified question as to whether a department of natural resources' rule that regulated the speed of motor boats was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed the trial court's order, which granted defendant's motion to dismiss charges for rule violation and which held the rule unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling limiting defendant's standing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the charge against appellee, finding chapter 817.29 to be unconstitutionally vague. Appellant state sought review. The court reversed. The court held that the test for unconstitutional vagueness was whether the language of the statute conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The court held that although the legislature did not specifically define the term cheat within chapter 817.29, that omission did not render the provision unconstitutionally vague. The court held that in the case of chapter 817.29, the legislature expressly incorporated the common law offense in defining the statutory offense. Accordingly, the court held that chapter 817.29 and the common law offense conveyed sufficiently definite warnings of the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice so that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The trial court subsequently reconsidered the term imposed and resentenced appellant on September 6, 1991. The court below summarily denied appellant motion to correct an illegal sentence.

The trial court had denied the motion based upon the fact that the imposition of sentence and resentencing occurred outside the applicable window period. The judgment of the court below was vacated and remanded for resentencing because the relevant time period was the date the offense was committed and because appellant's classification as a violent felony offender was based on the unconstitutional amendment's to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Escambia County Circuit Court (Florida) that convicted him of false imprisonment and aggravated assault and alleged the information charging him with the kidnapping of either of two victims was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of false imprisonment and aggravated assault, appellant sought review and alleged the trial court erred in the use of an information charging him with the kidnapping of either of two victims. The court agreed with appellant that the information was flawed as drafted, but found that the error was waived by appellant's failure to file a motion for dismissal. The court held that the charging of multiple offenses in a single count of an indictment or information was among the many defects that could be waived by a failure to present a timely objection. Because the count in question only charged alternative means of committing the offense of armed kidnapping, the court held that fundamental error was not involved and that it was required to rule that appellant waived his challenge to the information. However, the court noted that the judgment erroneously described the offense of aggravated assault as a second-degree felony rather than a third-degree felony. The court therefore remanded the case for correction of the judgment to reflect a third-degree felony for aggravated assault but affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the adoption petition and then terminated the mother's parental rights based upon findings of abandonment and neglect. On appeal, the court said that the trial court's ruling which permitted the child to file the petition in his own name constituted harmless error after four other petitions were filed on his behalf. The court affirmed the order that terminated appellant's parental rights because the applicable burden of proof in all termination of parental rights proceedings was clear and convincing evidence. The record supported the trial court's findings of clear and convincing evidence of abandonment. The court reversed the order which granted the adoption petition and remanded because the trial court committed reversible error when an order of adoption was entered before a written order terminating parental rights was filed and it was clear that such order would not be affected by rehearing or appeal. The court added that the trial court erred when it tried the termination and adoption proceedings simultaneously, but such error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile delinquent was charged with and adjudicated delinquent for escape due to his leaving a restricted juvenile facility. He argued, both before the circuit court and on appeal, that his escape adjudication was invalid owing to the fact that the juvenile escape statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, a state appellate court rejected his arguments, as had the circuit court, and upheld his delinquency adjudication. The appellate court observed that the escape statute held unconstitutional had since been amended, that the earlier version was unconstitutional because it allowed an executive agency to determine what level of restriction a juvenile delinquent was to have and thus violated the separation-of-powers doctrine, and that the amended version of the statute left that discretion in the hands of circuit court judge. Accordingly, appellant's delinquency adjudication was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's escape adjudication was affirmed. The statute to which appellant referred to had been modified, and the current version required the juvenile judge to set the restrictiveness level.

The petitions alleged that appellee had unlawfully escaped from a juvenile rehabilitation center while under the lawful control of the state department of health and rehabilitative services, contrary to Fla.

If the legislature had intended to criminalize escapes only from halfway houses and similar programs and from the specific programs contained within the definition of a high-risk residential facility, the legislature could have dispensed with the definitional language. The court noted that the legislature authorized residential programs to be developed by counties and municipalities and authorized courts to place delinquent youth in such programs, which were not required to be identical to model programs.

On review the court held that appellant was entitled to a declaration of its rights because it clearly appeared that there was a bona fide, actual, present practical need for the declaration, which dealt with a ascertainable state of facts, that some immunity, power, privilege or right was dependent upon the facts or applicable law, that there was some person who had an adverse interest, and that the adverse interest were all before the court by proper process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the lineal descendants of a decedent's deceased spouse, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Indian River County (Florida), which dismissed appellants' complaint with prejudice. Appellants sought a declaration that appellees became constructive trustees of decedent's real estate and argued that it was inequitable and unconscionable that decedent's remarriage should cause appellants to not share the real estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of appellants' complaint. However, the court certified the question of whether Fla. Stat. ch. 732.401(1) (1991), which vested a remainder interest in homestead property in lineal descendants, was unconstitutional when applied to defeat a testator's intent to devise homestead property equally to adult stepchildren as well as adult lineal descendants? Appellants were the lineal descendants of decedent's former wife, who had died two years prior to decedent. Decedent bequeathed his property to his children and stepchildren, but after the first wife's death, decedent again married. Upon his death, the new wife received a life estate with the remainder to appellees, decedent's lineal descendants. On review, the court was unable to conclude that appellants' argument that the statute improperly vested a remainder interest in lineal descendants lacked merit. The court held that any intent decedent had to devise an interest to appellants was frustrated by Fla. Stat. ch. 732.401(1) (1991) but declined to hold the statute unconstitutional, recognizing that the legislature was presumed to be aware of the plain meaning of the statute's terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's dismissal of appellant lineal descendants' complaint with prejudice was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Health and Rehabilitate services (HRS) brought an action against appellant to terminate his parental rights because of emotional abuse. On remand, the trial court issued an order finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.464(4) was unconstitutional in denying appellant procedural due process. On appeal, the court disagreed. The trial court erred in finding the statute unconstitutional based on failure to require that HRS plead egregious abuse in the dependency petition, or failure to require appointment of counsel at the dependency arraignment. The petition filed by HRS was deficient, based on Fla. R. Juv. P. 8.330(a), which required that it allege egregious abuse. Further, the trial court impermissibly found egregious emotional abuse to be proven by clear and convincing evidence. The record showed at most only emotional abuse, which was insufficient. Thus, the insufficiency of the petition did not point to the unconstitutionality of ch. 39.464(4), and the court had a duty to preserve the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant state failed to provide any evidence demonstrating how a blanket prohibition on the publication of information identifying a sexual offense victim had affected reports of such crimes. Because criminal liability flowed automatically under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.03 upon publication, even though the broad ban on publication might not have been necessary to effectuate appellant state's interests, the statute failed the strict tests for overbreadth. Thus, it was patently violative of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought the court's review. The court held that although the only felony convictions used to designate appellant as a violent offender were from another state, those out-of-state convictions were allowed to enhance appellant's sentence pursuant to the amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989), and even without that amendment, those convictions could have been used to extend appellant's sentence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1988 Supp.). Further, although the amendment to ch. 775.084 had been found unconstitutional, because appellant had prior violent felony convictions from out-of-state, and because appellant had been convicted of an enumerated violent felony pursuant to ch. 775.084, appellant's sentence was not affected by the amendment, and his conviction and sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 415.111(5) (1991). The trial court dismissed the charges on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The prosecution appealed. The court found that the term &quot;improper&quot; in the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it left individuals of common understanding and intelligence guessing at its meaning. However, the court determined that the word &quot;illegal&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. Those who committed criminal acts involving the use of an aged person's funds with the purpose of profiting from the illegality were sufficiently put on notice that such acts were prohibited. The court concluded that the term &quot;improper&quot; could be severed from the statute because deletion did not affect the remainder of the statute and did not thwart legislative intent. The statute, with the term &quot;improper&quot; severed, was constitutional; the court therefore vacated the orders dismissing the charges against defendants, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a violation of community control, an habitual offender sentence was imposed on appellant. On appeal, appellant argued that his sentence should be reversed because the Florida Supreme Court had held that the 1989 amendments to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 violated the single subject rule. Finding that appellant was correct, the court reversed appellant's sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court found that appellant, being sentenced for offenses committed prior to May 2, 1991, could not qualify as a habitual felony offender unless he or she had previously been convicted of two or more felonies in Florida. In sentencing appellant as a habitual offender, the trial judge relied on two prior felonies from outside Florida.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state department of transportation sought rehearing following the lower court's grant of partial final summary judgment to appellee shopping center. The case originated as an inverse condemnation proceeding and involved the issue of whether the mere inclusion of appellees' property within the boundaries of a map of reservation filed by appellant, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 337.241(1) (1987), had amounted to a per se taking. The court reversed and held that a regulatory enactment declared unconstitutional as an invalid exercise of police power did not necessarily mean a &quot;taking&quot; of the regulated property had occurred. Accordingly, a traditional &quot;takings&quot; analysis must still have been applied to each affected parcel. The lower court granted appellees' motion based on an erroneous interpretation of the law, and the court reversed when it discerned a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether a taking of appellees' property occurred.</SPAN></P>

However, the court also held that the lower appellate court's definition of the term &quot;lewdness&quot; was incomplete. The court first noted that case law applied general definitions of lewdness that were similar as applied to various statutes. The court then reasoned that, when enacting the statute at issue, the state's legislature did not suggest that it intended a narrower definition for the term &quot;lewdness&quot; as previously defined in case law. Thus, the court held the lower appellate court erred in ordering the trial court to ignore such case law when defining the term for the statute at issue.</SPAN></P>

Appellees requested that appellant county be enjoined from issuing the dangerous dog classification on the defense the dog was not dangerous. The trial court determined that ch. 767.12 had no provision for a hearing before a dog was declared dangerous and, thus, concluded the statute was unconstitutional because it deprived appellees of procedural due process. The appellate court affirmed the trial court, finding that procedural due process imposed constraints on governmental decisions, which deprive individuals of liberty or property interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of, U.S Const. amends. V and XIV. The court found it undisputed that dogs were the subjects of property or ownership. The court held that to allow the enforcement of the restrictions under ch. 767.12 before a dog owner was given an opportunity to be heard was clearly a violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the habitual offender statute, ch. 775.084, was unconstitutional, and that the trial court failed to make all of the findings requisite to imposition of an habitual violent felony offender sentence. On remand from the state supreme court, the court affirmed appellant's sentence. The court stated that the constitutionality of ch. 775.084 had already been upheld in numerous Florida decisions. Following the Rucker decision, the court further found that the trial court's failure to make all of the findings required by the habitual offender statute was harmless error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In companion cases, a defendant and the state appealed the judgments from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) and the Circuit Court for Lake County (Florida), regarding the issue of whether Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04, which provided that consent was not a defense to a prosecution for sexual activity with a minor under sixteen, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered companion appeals in two cases, in one of which Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04 (1991) was held unconstitutional, and in the other of which the validity of the statute was upheld and the defendant was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for violating it. The State urged that the young men involved in the appeals lacked standing to assert the young women's rights to privacy even if such rights exist, but the court rejected the argument. The court then considered the related issue of whether a minor under sixteen years of age had a right, protected by Florida's constitutional right of privacy, to engage in consensual sex. The State's compelling interest in protecting minors arose from the peculiar vulnerability of children and their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner. The court believed that the minor's right to consensual sex was not substantially burdened by requiring a delayed exercise of such right, and the court upheld the constitutionality of ch. 800.04. Because of the importance of the issue, the court certified the issue of the appeals to the Florida Supreme Court as one of exceptional importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court believed that the minor's right to consensual sex was not substantially burdened by requiring a delayed exercise of such right, similar to voting, drinking, and driving, and the court upheld the constitutionality of the statute at issue. The court, therefore, affirmed the conviction in one of the cases and reversed the decision in the case that did not convict and remanded them for further action.</SPAN></P>

The informant's tip also gave defendant's race, sex, and clothing, and that defendant placed stolen guns in the car. As such, the tip indicated personal observation by the informant, and prompt police action resulted in finding defendant in the named location, and exactly fitting the description.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his sentence as a habitual felony offender from the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida). Appellant asserted that he was sentenced under a version of the statute later invalidated, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a)(1989), and that his sentence violated the single subject rule when his two prior offenses of threatening the sheriff and a judge occurred in the same telephone call.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence as a habitual felony offender. Appellant was sentenced under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a)(1989), which was later invalidated. The court held that appellant fell within a class of offenders who were sentenced within the window period before the 1989 statute was declared unconstitutional. The court stated that resentencing would only be required if the same sentence could not have been imposed under the prior version of the statute. The prior version of the statute, 1988 Fla. Laws ch. 88-131, required two prior convictions in Florida. The court held that appellant had two prior convictions in Florida when, in a telephone call, he threatened harm to the sheriff and the county judge. The court rejected appellant's argument that both crimes occurred during a single episode and should not count as two convictions. The court found that when the record did not reflect that the threats were made in a single phone call or two calls and when caselaw that supported appellant's argument was in a concurrence and not adopted by the majority opinion, the trial court did not lack statutory authority to sentence appellant as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence as a felony offender. The court agreed that although appellant was sentenced under a statute that was later invalidated, he could have received the same sentence under prior version of the statute. The court held that when record did not reflect if both threats were made in one call or two and caselaw cited by appellant was not adopted by majority, trial court was within its statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parole commission established appellee inmate's presumptive parole release date (PPRD) following his convictions for robbery, assault with intent to commit murder in the second degree, and aggravated assault. On two occasions based upon the sentencing judge's objection, appellant decided not to authorize appellee's effective parole release date and instead extended appellee's PPRD. The trial court entered an order granting appellee's petition for a writ of mandamus, holding that appellant's use of the sentencing judge's judicial objection violated appellee's right to substantive due process. The trial court ordered appellant to rescind its action and to require more than a nonspecific judicial objection as the basis for an extension of appellee's PPRD. The appellate court reversed and remanded with directions to the trial court to dismiss appellee's petition, finding that there was nothing in Fla. Stat. ch. 947.1745(4) and 947.165(1) or in case law which precluded appellant from considering a continued or second objection from the sentencing judge. The court certified two questions related to a sentencing court's objection to a PPRD.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession with intent to sell or purchase cocaine within 200 feet of a public housing facility, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(i) (1991). He challenged his conviction, contending the statute was unconstitutionally vague and violated state and federal guarantees of dues process and equal protection. Specifically, he challenged the term &quot;public housing facility&quot; as being so indefinite that it failed to give notice of what conduct was prohibited. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court held that ch. 893.13(1)(i) was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The term &quot;public housing&quot; encompassed affordable, government subsidized housing for individuals or families with varied needs. The term &quot;facility&quot; was something built or installed to perform a particular function. The statute provided sufficient guidance to drug dealers to allow them to avoid the enhanced penalty imposed by the Legislature. Further, the legislature's determination that public housing residents were entitled to special protection from drug-related crimes had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for burglary of a dwelling. Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of acquittal based on the insufficiency of the evidence. He asserted that the state failed to prove intent to commit an offense, failed to prove stealthy entry, and failed to establish burglary because there was no showing defendant entered the dwelling. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 810.07(1) (1989) provided that entering a structure at any time stealthily and without consent of the owner was prima facie evidence of entering with intent to commit an offense. The court found that defendant entered a fenced yard and sought entry into a house through a rear window, which was in a secluded location calculated to avoid discovery. The court determined that there was ample evidence of defendant's stealthy entry onto the curtilage, which by definition under Fla. Stat. ch. 810.011(1) and (2) (1989) was part of the structure of the dwelling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for disturbing the contents of a grave was overturned on appeal but he was convicted in a retrial, which presented substantially the same evidence.

Although a different judge imposed the second sentence so there was no presumption of self-vindication, the court found that the enhancement was imposed for an improper reason--to punish defendant for exercising his right of appeal. The court noted that no evidence was introduced at the second trial concerning defendant's subsequent conduct that would justify a harsher sentence, and that an unconstitutional reason was given for requesting the fine as an additional term of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, an employee of appellee county, sought review of the order from the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida) that gave him workers' compensation permanent total disability benefits for the loss of both legs, but did not include value of his uniforms in determining his average weekly wage. Claimant alleged that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a)1 (1989) was unconstitutional for awarding special benefits for the loss of one leg, but not both legs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, an employee of appellee county, had both his legs amputated after a work-related accident. Although he could no longer work, he was officially retained as an employee, and continued to receive uniforms from appellee. The state judge of compensation claims awarded claimant workers' compensation permanent total disability (PTD) benefits, but did not include the value of the uniforms in calculating claimant's average weekly wage (AWW). On appeal, the court held that because claimant was not permitted to wear the uniforms because he was no longer on duty, they did not benefit him and should have been included in calculating claimant's AWW. Because Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a)1 (1989) did not discriminate against amputees in an irrational manner, but provided different benefits to different injuries by granting a special impairment benefit to those who lost one leg and by presuming entitlement to PTD benefits pursuant to ch. 440.15(1)(b) to those who lost both legs, ch. 440.15(3)(a)1 (1989) was not unconstitutional. Therefore, the court reversed the order with respect to the AWW, affirmed it in all other respects, and remanded the case for recalculation of the AWW.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order in all respects except for the calculation of the workers' compensation average weekly wage (AWW) for claimant, an employee of appellee county, and remanded the case for its recalculation, because claimant was not permitted to wear his uniforms, thus their value had to be included in calculating the AWW, and because the statute could constitutionally give different benefits to those with different amputations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a county, enacted Alachua County, Fla., Ordinance 91-5 (ordinance) that prohibited nudity in liquor establishments. Appellant, the owner of a business that served alcohol and featured nude dancers, filed a petition for a temporary injunction to stay the application of the ordinance because of appellee's failure to follow the procedures of Fla. Stat. ch. 125.66(6) (1991). The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court held that because the ordinance regulated conduct, it was not an ordinance that affected land. Because the ordinance covered the entire county except those municipalities that opted out of the ordinance pursuant to appellee's charter, the ordinance was not a de facto zoning ordinance within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 125.66(5) (1991). Thus, the ordinance was not subject to the enactment procedures of ch. 125.66(6) (1991), and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus to obtain his pre-trial release after he was arrested for &quot;domestic violence battery.&quot; Although petitioner was subsequently released on bail after a domestic violence investigation was completed, the court decided to address the issue because it was one of importance and was likely to recur. The court found that any policy that authorized the denial of pre-trial release for those charged with simple battery based on a finding of potential harm was unconstitutional. Although petitioner was arrested and charged with &quot;domestic violence battery,&quot; there was no such statutory offense. Before denying pre-trial release because of the threat of harm to the community, a court was required to make several findings, including that the present charge was a &quot;dangerous crime.&quot; The legislature's definition of &quot;dangerous crime&quot; included the felony offense of aggravated battery. There was no constitutional or statutory authority for denying pre-trial release to one charged with misdemeanor battery where the detention was based on a finding of threat of harm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida) after it denied his motion to correct sentence. Appellant's motion to correct sentence was based solely on the argument that the habitual offender statute was passed in violation of the single subject rule of the Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 (1968).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault, shooting into an occupied dwelling, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, tampering with evidence, criminal mischief, fleeing and attempting to elude police, reckless driving, and driving without a driver's license. The lower court denied appellant's motion to correct sentence. Appellant's motion to correct sentence was based solely on the argument that the habitual offender statute was passed in violation of the single subject rule of the Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 (1968). The judgment of the lower court was affirmed. The court held the 1989 amendment modified Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a)1 by requiring that defendant be previously convicted of any combination of two or more felonies in Florida or other qualified offenses. Because appellant's prior felonies included two Florida offenses in addition to an out-of-state felony, the 1989 amendment did not affect appellant's sentence and status as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of attempted trafficking in marijuana. Appellee assessed appellant a tax at the rate of 50 percent of the estimated retail price of the marijuana under Fla. Stat. ch. 212.0505(1)(a) (Supp. 1988). Appellee also assessed a statutory surcharge under ch. 212.0505(1)(b), and a penalty under ch. 212.12(2). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of ch. 212.0505. The court held that ch. 212.0505 was facially unconstitutional because it violated appellant's right against compelled self-incrimination under the Fifth and 14th Amendments of the United States Constitution. The statute's disclosure requirements created a real and appreciable risk of self-incrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that struck down a requirement that candidates for elected county office be residents of that county for two years immediately prior to qualifying for the election as violating the equal protection clause. The court did not agree with appellee, a candidate for sheriff, that the restriction required strict scrutiny due to its effect on the fundamental right to travel, nor did it agree with appellant county officials that the restriction only required traditional equal protection analysis. Instead, the court held that it was not the existence of the candidate durational residency requirement, by itself, that seriously infringed on a fundamental right so as to require application of strict scrutiny; rather, it was the length of the durational residency requirement that determined which equal protection analysis would be applied. The court found that strict scrutiny should apply when the duration, two years, was unreasonable.

The court held that the state supreme court had found the statutes were unconstitutional as applied to specific facts where a defendant requested arbitration and therefore subjected the claimants to certain limitations whether they accepted or rejected the offer to arbitrate. The statutes were not, however, found to be facially invalid. Further, the statutes were not unconstitutional as applied to the facts presented here where plaintiffs, as the medical malpractice claimants, had requested arbitration to begin with, and therefore had voluntarily subjected themselves to certain limitations, even though nothing in the statutes required them to do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed order from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County, (Florida) sealing appellee's court records and other criminal history records in reliance on Fla. Stat. ch. 943.058(1991). The prosecution argued that this was improper because the trial court could not seal the court records without making certain findings based on constitutional principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed order sealing appellee's court records and other criminal history records in reliance on Fla. Stat. ch. 943.058(1991). The prosecution claimed court records could not be sealed without making findings based on constitutional principles. The court held that Fla. Stat. 943.058(1991) did not provide the standards to seal court records. The standard used was a constitutional one. In excluding court records from the operation of the statute, court records were protected by U.S. Const. amend. I . That constitutional protection required courts, before sealing such records, to make findings based on compelling interest/least restrictive means test. Closure may be ordered if it served a compelling interest; there was substantial probability that, in the absence of closure, compelling interest would be harmed; and there were no alternatives to closure that would adequately protect compelling interest. It was error for the trial court to seal appellee's court records without making constitutional findings. The U.S. Const. amend. I did not guarantee access to other criminal history records, which may be sealed solely by resort to requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 943.058.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court concluded the sealing of appellee's court records was improper absent the proper constitutional findings. The judgment was affirmed insofar as the order required the sealing of criminal history records other than court records, which may be sealed solely by resort to requirements of Florida statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a decision of the County Court for Leon County (Florida) that granted appellee driver's motion to suppress statements made to the investigating officer at the scene of the accident on the ground that such statements were privileged under the accident report privilege set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 316.066(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee driver was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, he filed a motion to suppress the statements he made at the scene under the accident report privilege. The trial court granted the motion. The court thereafter certified a question regarding whether a 1991 amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.066(4) changed the pre-amendment case law requirement that a law enforcement officer was required to apprise a defendant when the officer's questions were part of a criminal investigation, so that a defendant could understand that his answers to the officer's questions were no longer privileged. The appellate court held that pursuant to the amendment, no driver was compelled to give incriminating information to an officer investigating a traffic accident and that an officer could testify to statements that were voluntarily made by a driver and that had not been obtained in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V protections. The court held that the trial court was required to review the facts on a case by case basis in order to determine if a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights had occurred. The court therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of appellee driver's motion to suppress statements he made at the scene of a drunk driving action and remanded with instructions to the trial court to make an individualized determination regarding whether appellee's constitutional right against self incrimination had been violated.</SPAN></P>

At the following sentencing proceeding, the state sought habitual offender classification.

Without making any of the specific findings set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a), the trial court found simply that appellant met the statutory requirements for sentencing as an habitual felony offender, and proceeded to impose concurrent five year terms. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that, because the state introduced unrebutted evidence of appellant's prior convictions, the trial court's failure to make any of the findings set forth at ch. 775.084(1)(a) was harmless error under Rucker. Under these circumstances, the court noted, no subjective analysis was required to determine either the existence of the requisite prior felony convictions or that the last prior felony conviction occurred within five years of the commission of the present felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), which summarily denied his motion to correct his sentences pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for several drug-related offenses and for an aggravated assault offense. The trial court sentenced him as a habitual offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989), based on two convictions in Georgia and a prior grand theft conviction in Florida. Appellant filed a motion to correct his sentences under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a), which the trial court summarily denied. On appeal, the court vacated the sentences, as appellant was sentenced at a time under which the 1989 amendments to the habitual offender statute applied, but were later declared unconstitutional. Furthermore, the court found that the 1989 amendments did affect his categorization as a habitual offender because, prior to those amendments, a defendant could not be habitualized by using out-of-state felony convictions. Because the Georgia convictions were necessary to support the requirement of two prior convictions under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a)1 (Supp. 1988), appellant could not have been sentenced as a habitual offender without them. The court vacated the sentences imposed upon appellant and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sentences imposed upon appellant for several drug-related offenses and an aggravated assault offense were vacated and remanded for resentencing, as the amendments to the habitual offender statute upon which they were based were later held to be unconstitutional. It was also obvious that such amendments affected his sentencing, as they allowed his prior out-of-state convictions to be considered in determining his habitual offender status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with the sale or delivery of cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(a)1. The state filed a notice of intent to seek habitual felony offender sentencing if appellant was found guilty as charged. A jury returned a guilty verdict. The trial court found that appellant should be sentenced as a habitual offender based on his past criminal record, which was documented by certified copies of his prior convictions in evidence. In appellant's sentencing appeal, he raised two challenges. First, he contended that the habitual felony offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989), was unconstitutional. The court summarily dismissed this challenge and noted that even appellant recognized that this issue has been decided adversely to him numerous times. Secondly, appellant argued that the trial court failed to make the required statutory findings that were prerequisites to sentencing him as a felony offender. The court concluded that the trial court permissibly assumed that appellant's predicate convictions were not pardoned or set aside because it had unrebutted evidence of his prior convictions in the record.</SPAN></P>

It also rejected the contention that the habitual offender statute was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence and the denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence. Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to robbery, and the trial judge sentenced him as an habitual offender. Appellant moved to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) and argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, as amended by 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 89-280, was unconstitutional as violative of the single-subject rule. The trial court denied appellant's motion on the ground that the constitutionality of the habitual offender statute was improperly raised in a motion pursuant to that rule. On review, the court found that the rule allowed appellant to raise the legality of his sentence at any time and that although appellant pled to the habitual offender sentence, he could not have legally agreed to an illegal sentence as part of a plea bargain. The court held, however, that an habitual offender sentence was illegal only if it was not a sentence that the trial court could have imposed as a matter of law, and the court found that appellant failed to prove that he could not have been habitualized without the amendments to the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment because it found that appellee was injured by the taking and entitled to compensation. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded for further proceedings. There was no evidence that appellee was injured and entitled to compensation merely because appellant filed the reservation map.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment which dismissed charges of disturbing a religious assembly in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 871.01 (1991). The trial court dismissed the charges against appellees on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The statute provided that any person who willfully interrupted or disturbed any school or any assembly of people met for the worship of God or for any lawful purpose shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree. Appellees were charged under the statute after they disrupted a service during an on-going dispute between two factions over control of a church. The dispute became so acrimonious that police officers were stationed in the church at taxpayers' expense. The trial court was particularly concerned with the police involvement, indicating that it showed a specific government intrusion into the operation of a religious body. The court reviewed the undisputed facts of the case and found that they were not sufficient to sustain dismissal on grounds of unconstitutional application of the statute. Further, the court held that the statute was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Police, pursuant to a search warrant, seized boxes of records from the premises. The trial court granted defendant's request to suppress the evidence and the state appealed. In reversing the decision excluding most of the documents seized, the court held that where the criminal activity pervaded the entire business, seizure of all of its business records, such as bank ledgers, computer disks, and sales records was appropriate and broad language in the warrant did not offend the particularity requirement. However, seizure of documentary evidence tending to establish the identity of persons involved in the alleged crime failed the particularity test because it impermissibly left the decision as to whether a document fell within the warrant to the discretion of the investigating officers.</SPAN></P>

Appellant did not dispute the convictions, and the trial court sentenced him to six years as a habitual felony offender without making the findings set forth at Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a) (1989). In its answer brief, the state noted the trial court's failure to make the findings set forth at Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a). Appellant alleged the unconstitutionality of Fla.

R. Crim. P. 3.850 alleging that the two concurrent sentences he received as an habitual offender were illegal. Appellant contended that he committed his crimes during the period when Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 was unconstitutional as violative of the single-subject rule of the Florida Constitution. The court affirmed and held that it could not determine from the record whether appellant was entitled to consideration of the constitutionality issue. The amendments provided that out-of-state convictions could be used to qualify a defendant as an habitual felony offender and added aggravated battery as a qualifying offense for habitual violent felony offender status. Appellant was not sentenced as a violent felony offender and did not allege that out-of-state convictions were used to qualify him as an habitual offender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) requiring appellant to pay child support through the date when the child was expected to graduate from high school, a date that was well past the child's 19th birthday. Appellant argued that the order exceeded the limits of Fla. Stat. ch. 743.02(2) (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and appellee wife were divorced in California in 1978. They had one child, who was born in 1973. The parties had the California judgment domesticated in Florida. The judgment provided for $ 387.00 per month child. In 1991, appellee petitioned to extend appellant's child support payments through June of 1993, some seven months after the child would turn 19 years of age. The child's graduation was delayed because he had been held back twice during elementary school. However, he was not physically or mentally incapacitated. The court found that a revision to Fla. Stat. ch. 743.07(2) (1991), made effective after the petition for modification was filed, was applicable, and carved out a limited and specific category of teenagers for whom child support could be ordered past their 18th birthdays. The court found that the child was not eligible for the extension of support under express wording of the statute because children who were held back a year or two, but who are on course to graduate late, were not entitled to support after their 18th birthday under the statute. The court certified a question of whether the statute violated state and federal equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant business operator was charged with violating the recordkeeping requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 538.04. Defendant claimed as a defense that his business was a flea market and, thus, exempt from the reporting requirements under Fla. Stat. ch. 538.03(2)(k). At defendant's trial, evidence established that defendant operated a secondhand store in a plaza that did not have booths or areas for separate vendors and that the word &quot;flea market&quot; did not appear inside or outside his store. The trial court set aside the jury's verdict and dismissed the information after finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 538.03-538.17 was both unconstitutionally vague and denied equal protection. The court reversed the trial court's order. The term &quot;flea market&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because it had a plain and ordinary meaning. The legislature's classification of flea markets did not deny equal protection because there was a rational basis for the classification. The distinction among secondhand dealers was reasonably related to preventing criminal activity or the transfer of illegal secondhand goods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, juvenile, sought review of conviction of escape under Fla. Stat. 39.112 (1989) following adjudication as delinquent child and commitment to juvenile facility Appellant argued the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the escape charge because Fla. Stat. ch. 39.112(1989) was repealed and was not in effect when he allegedly committed the offense. The prosecution argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.112(1989) was revived or remained effective based on the principle that, where a repealing act was adjudged unconstitutional. the statute it attempted to repeal remained in force. The court rejected the prosecution's argument regarding reviving the validity of repealed Fla. Stat. ch. 39.112. The court concluded that the entire statute had not been invalidated, nor the repealer provision, and a significant portion of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061 was left effect. There was no legal basis for reviving the repealed Fla. Stat. ch. 39.112. The courts should disfavor creating a hybrid statute comprised of parts taken from both present-day and superseded enactments. Such an action interjected the judiciary into a realm of policy considerations that properly belonged to legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), dismissing their medical malpractice suit due to the statute of repose, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sued appellee clinic for medical malpractice. The lower court dismissed the suit based upon the statute of repose, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1983). Appellant sought review and appellate court affirmed, holding that the repose statute was not an unconstitutional denial of access to courts even though appellants neither knew nor could have reasonably known of an injury before the expiration of the repose period. The court explained that the statute of repose precluded a right to file a malpractice action after a specified time measured from the date of malpractice, otherwise known as the accrual date. The facts of an individual case were not considered once it was established that the malpractice occurred more than four years before the filing of the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal with prejudice because the applicable statute of repose barred the action even though appellant's medical malpractice claim expired before appellants knew or could have known of the injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed for a writ of certiorari from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Highlands County (Florida), which granted respondent owners' motion to sever its claim and petitioners' counterclaim in a mortgage foreclosure lawsuit, and which entered a judgment of foreclosure on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners bought a golf course from respondents, executing a promissory note and mortgage. After petitioners defaulted on mortgage, respondents filed a mortgage foreclosure suit. Petitioners counterclaimed that there was fraud in the inducement because respondents failed to disclose certain defects. Respondents moved for severance of the two claims and for a judgment on the pleadings. The lower court granted those motions and foreclosed. Petitioner appealed. In reversing and remanding, the appellate court held that it was treating the appeal as a writ of certiorari because pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 9.110, an appeal was not allowed until the pending counterclaim was resolved. The court also ruled that the trial court abused its discretion and improperly granted severance under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.270(b). The court stated that fraudulent inducement was a compulsory legal counterclaim to a foreclosure suit, which gave petitioner a right to a jury trial. The lower court impaired this right when it severed the claim and entered a final judgment before it resolved the defense of fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of foreclosure and remanded the matter because the lower court improperly severed petitioner's claim; it denied him his right to a jury trial; thus, the judgment on the pleadings was also in error.</SPAN></P>

When the letter was not answered by respondent, prisoner sought a writ of mandamus to have compel respondent to answer his correspondence. The court stated that the writ of mandamus was intended to accomplish certain limited functions and not redress every grievance or disagreement. The court stated that mandamus was used to compel an official to perform lawful duties and not to supervise the order of priority assigned to appeals, and certainly not to monitor the flow of correspondence between attorney and client.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated battery and robbery with a deadly weapon. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that although the trial court erred when it admitted evidence of flight, the admission of the evidence constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found no merit in appellant's contention that the trial court erred when it refused to admit evidence of an out-of-state felony to impeach a prosecution witness. The court also rejected appellant's argument that the habitual offender statute was unconstitutional. However, because the trial court failed to make any of the required findings under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a) (1991), the sentence imposed was reversed. The cause was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
