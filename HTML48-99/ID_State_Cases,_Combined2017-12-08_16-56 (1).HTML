<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, State Board of Education (board) and university officials, appealed an order of the District Court of the Second Judicial District, Latah County (Idaho), which found that defendants failed to prove that the university's financial crisis could not have been adequately alleviated other than by means of a reduction in personnel that included the termination of plaintiff professor in the professor's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The professor was terminated from a tenured faculty position that she held for last nine years. She was the most experienced of the five members of the extension service program but the only one laid off. The university officials argued that the only valid reason for termination was the existence of a financial exigency or a demonstrably bona fide, imminent financial crisis that threatened the viability of the department. The trial court held that the board and the university officials had the burden of proof on their affirmative defense and could have considered other alternatives from reductions in personnel when it declared the financial exigency. On appeal, the court agreed and affirmed the trial court. The court held that there was substantial competent evidence that the board and the university officials failed to carry their burden of proving a financial exigency. They did not consider freezing or reducing the other budget areas of travel or supplies and were not advised of a surplus at the end of the fiscal year that could have reduced the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the board and the university officials lacked a valid financial exigency to justify terminating the professor in her &sect; 1983 employment case.</SPAN></P>

The Honorable Boyd R. Thomas, District Judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from district court's holding that I.C. &sect; 63-105DD, the so-called &quot;50-50 homeowners' exemption,&quot; does not violate the state or federal constitutions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant homeowner challenged a judgment from the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District for the County of Bonneville (Idaho) finding that Idaho Code &sect; 63-105DD did not violate Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The homeowner argued that the 50-50 exemption that granted a greater tax exemption for owner-occupied homes violated Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2 and 5, which required uniform taxation and treatment of property. The homeowner further argued that the exemption violated the equal protection and the contract clauses. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that art. VII, &sect; 5 expressly authorized partial exemptions from taxation as from time to time was necessary and just. This extremely broad and deferential language in no way suggested property might be wholly, but not partially, exempt. Therefore, the partial exemption under Idaho Code &sect; 63-105DD of owner-occupied residential improvements did not violate art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2 or 5. Second, the court held that the homeowner was not a suspect class and so there was no equal protection implication. Third, the court held that a statute that did not act on the contract itself but merely on the property that was the subject of the contract did not impair the obligation of the contract. The value of the contract might be diminished, but the obligation of the parties to each other was not affected in the slightest degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district court declared that the state constitution empowered the State Auditor to conduct &quot;post-audits,&quot; that the legislature could not divest the State Auditor of such authority through the appropriation process, and that the legislature's failure to provide funding to the State Auditor for post-audits deprived the him of his constitutional authority. The court affirmed in part finding that the post-audit function was a constitutional duty of the State Auditor where it was not precluded from performing modern post-audit functions that the Territorial Controller would have performed had the functions existed when Idaho was a territory. Even if the State Auditor did not exercise its power to perform post-audit functions, the legislature could not usurp that power even though it was traditionally performed by the legislature. Nothing prohibited the legislature from duplicating audits performed by the State Auditor, nor from examining its own books. The court dissolved the injunction that required the Legislative Auditor to perform any post-audits that the State Auditor requested and required the legislature to appropriate funds to the State Auditor for the post-audit function.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was filed on September 27, 1985, and denied on October 23, 1985. Plaintiff filed his notice of appeal on December 3, 1985. The court held that although plaintiff's motion for a new trial was timely filed within 10 days of the entry of judgment and terminated the 42-day time period within which to appeal pursuant to Idaho App. R. 14, the denial of this motion reinstated the 42-day appeal period and, thus, plaintiff's appeal thereof was untimely. The court further held that even if plaintiff's motion to reconsider could be considered as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Idaho R. Civ. P. 59(e), it was untimely because it was not filed with 10 days of the order denying plaintiff's motion for a new trial and, thus, the trial court had no power to grant the requested relief.</SPAN></P>

The treasurer argued that this statute was unconstitutional because it contravened Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 4. The court held that a fundamental rule of statutory interpretation was that all statutes were presumed constitutional. The treasurer had the burden of showing that &sect; 58-140 was unconstitutional. The court noted that the land in dispute was dedicated to the public school funds. Under Idaho Admission Bill &sect; 5, all monies derived from the sale of the lands must be deposited in the Public School Fund and thereafter remain inviolate. Only the interest received from the investment of the fund could be withdrawn, and the interest could only be used for the maintenance of the public schools. The court noted that &sect; 58-140, which diverted 10 percent for the administration of the lands, was in accord with the principles of basic trust law.

Respondent employer, through its surety, cross-appealed with regard to the commission's finding that the claimant had presented a prima facie case of disability related to an occupational disease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant worked for the employer at a plywood assembly plant. She did not return to work following pulmonary testing in September 1981. She received non-occupational disability benefits until August 1982. She filed a claim for worker's compensation benefits in November 1982. The commission dismissed her claim. The claimant and employer, through its surety, filed cross-appeals. The court affirmed with regard to the claimant's appeal and, therefore, did not address the employer's appeal.  Idaho Code &sect; 72-448 required that a claim resulting from an occupational disease be filed within one year of the manifestation of that disease. The court found that Idaho Code &sect; 72-604, which tolled the limitations period for a willful failure to comply with Idaho Code &sect; 72-602(1), did not apply to &sect; 72-448. Furthermore, even if &sect; 72-604 did apply, the court found that the employer's failure to comply with &sect; 72-602(1) was the result of a misunderstanding and, therefore, was not willful. The court stated that the limitations period specified by Idaho Code &sect; 72-706 did not apply because the benefits that the claimant had received were not compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence supplied by plaintiffs in opposition of summary judgment was irrelevant, inadmissible, or incompetent as evidence, and, therefore, that it did not create any genuine issues of fact with regards to the firings. The court found that evidence were opinions or conclusions of the excluded plaintiff, which were not only inadmissible, but also contrary to admissible evidence in the record. In addition, the court found that the firing of one plaintiff was not in violation of her freedom to speech because the record demonstrated that she was not fired for criticizing and opposing the governor's proposed plans for the commission.</SPAN></P>

The Commission determined that Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316A(g)(1) was unconstitutional as a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Respondent was a schools-foundation and employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316A provided that employment was exempt where it was for (i) a church or convention or association of churches or (ii) an organization that was operated primarily for religious purposes and that was operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church, convention, or association of churches. Under &sect; 72-1316A(i), there were three categories of churches: the congregation or the hierarchy themselves, schools separately incorporated by churches, and religiously oriented schools incorporated by persons independent of any church involvement. The court ruled that the foundation in the case sub judice was none of the aforementioned; however, the court ruled that it was exempt under &sect; 72-1316A(ii) because extensive review of the foundation's intent and operations revealed that it was a school with a religious mission and purpose. The court held that the support referred to under &sect; 72-1316A(ii) was not required to be financial: moral as well as financial support was taken into consideration. The court held that moral support was principal support under &sect; 72-1316A(ii) where the school could not exist without the church support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under Ada County Zoning Ordinance &sect; 24.242 (1982), a conditional use permit for the operation of a day care center would not issue unless the day care center was licensed by the state department of health and welfare. Respondent county filed suit against appellant day care operators. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, granted partial summary judgment for the county. The operators appealed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held for the operators on other grounds. If the state required the mandatory licensing of children's day care businesses, the county, in conjunction with its zoning requirements, could have required an applicant for a conditional use permit to secure a state license for the operation of such a business. However, the county could not, as a part of its zoning scheme, require the operators, as applicants for a conditional use permit, to obtain a license for the conduct of an otherwise lawful business when no statute or ordinance of either the county or the state required the licensing of such otherwise lawful business. There was no showing that either the state or the county, in the exercise of their respective police powers, required the mandatory licensing of children's day care businesses. Thus, the county could not, through its zoning ordinances, validly require a license for the conduct of an otherwise lawful business when no state statute or county ordinance mandated such licensing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employer argued that the department's rules, 09.35.062 and .063, which define &quot;major&quot; delinquencies as all those involving amounts greater than $ 20, were arbitrary and capricious, and therefore invalid. Finding that the rules were not consonant with Idaho Code &sect; 72-1319 and that they were not reasonably related to that section, the court reversed the judgment. Section 72-1319 was the controlling statutory law, which contained the legislature's expressed intent on determining major and minor tax delinquencies. The court held that to accommodate the legislature's intent, as spelled out by &sect; 72-1319, the department had to allow a procedure for the director to consider the employer's explanation for becoming delinquent. What was a &quot;major&quot; delinquency to one employer might be a &quot;minor&quot; delinquency to another. Furthermore, for those delinquencies that were minor, the department had to decide if the employer had acted in good faith and if removal of the employer's favorable tax status would be inequitable. The department's rules, 09.35.062 and .063 were invalid because they contravened statutory law by erasing distinctions that were legislatively created and mandated.</SPAN></P>

State officials submitted a motion for change of venue. The district court granted a TRO and a change of venue. The new district court also granted a TRO and then a preliminary injunction. State officials appealed, seeking a determination whether the legislature's declaration of emergency in an act was immune from judicial review. Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal, seeking, inter alia, a determination whether the change of venue was error. The court held that the legislature was authorized by the constitution to declare an emergency and thereby render an act effective immediately upon its passage, and the people of Idaho were statutorily authorized to approve or reject that legislation at the next biennial election. Hence, the right to work bill was effective until at least November 4, 1986, and thereafter only if approved by the voters. The court also held that the change of venue was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with first degree murder. The District Court of the Third Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Canyon County, convicted the defendant for first degree murder and imposed the death penalty. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant participated with another in a burglary during which the other murdered the homeowner. In a separate trial after the co-defendant's trial, defendant was convicted for first degree murder and the death penalty was imposed. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded the case for re-sentencing because (1) a joint confession taken after initial questions but before Miranda warnings was proper as an intentional waiver of those rights; (2) the denial of a request to change venue was proper because despite widespread publicity after the conviction of the co-defendant, a jury unfamiliar with the facts was selected with relative ease; (3) photographs of the body were not inflammatory because the jury was entitled to a fair understanding of the evidence; and (4) the lack of jury participation in the capital punishment process was not unconstitutional. The court concluded that the sentence was disproportionately harsh because the death sentence was imposed on the defendant as the non-active partner in the burglary the same as it was imposed also on the active partner in the prior case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and remanded the case for re-sentencing because the court determined that the death sentence was disproportionate in the situation where the defendant had received the same death penalty sentence as a co-defendant in a separate trial even though the co-defendant had actually committed the murder and the defendant only participated in the underlying burglary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment from the District Court of the Third Judicial District, Canyon County (Idaho), which convicted him of first-degree murder and attempted rape of thirteen-year-old. Defendant challenged his convictions and corresponding death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court stated that the trial court did not deprive defendant of due process by jointly trying him with his co-defendant and by using separate juries sitting in the same courtroom because the co-defendant testified before defendant's jury and defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine. Thus, defendant was not denied the right of confrontation. It was not error for the trial court to admit photographs of the victim's body because evidence that established that the victim had her throat slit was relevant to the murder charge and the accompanying allegation that defendant had used a knife. It was not error to deny defendant's motion for a new trial based on a note from co-defendant that stated, &quot;I was worry by not telling the truth and about you as well,&quot; because the note was subject to multiple inferences. The trial court's failure to give the accomplice instruction, even if it were erroneous, was harmless. However, the court found that the sentence of death was excessive and disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and defendant. Accordingly, the conviction was affirmed but the sentence was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The arrestee contended that the police officers falsely arrested and physically assaulted him in order to extricate him from his car following a stop for driving under the influence. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment against city on the civil rights and state law claims, explaining that the arrestee failed to provide the requisite summary judgment support of his allegation that the city failed to adequately train the officers. The court further found that the arrestee also failed to link the alleged unconstitutional incident and a city policy. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment of the arrestee's civil rights claims against the police officers, concluding that factual questions were shown concerning whether the police officers employed excessive force in effectuating the arrest which was supported by probable cause. The court explained that the law was clearly established that good faith immunity did not apply if the police officers used excessive force or failed to inform the arrestee that he was under arrest.</SPAN></P>

The district court ruled that the circumstances surrounding the sale justified giving the debtor an equitable right of redemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The creditor obtained a judgment in the small claims court. The debtor appealed to the district court and the judgment was affirmed.

A sheriff's sale was scheduled with publication notice only; none of the interested parties or the debtor were personally notified. The district court granted the debtors' motion to set aside the sale. On review, the court found that equity justified the relief. Although the debtor had not timely exercised his statutory right, the court held that the lack of actual notice to all interested parties could only be remedied via a right of redemption. The following factors justified equitable relief: the gross inadequacy of the purchase price, the violation of the rights of innocent parties, lack of actual notice to interested parties, no execution on the appeal bond prior to sale, and failure to obtain a charging order on the partnership pursuant to Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 53-325(2)(c) and 53-328.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant and a co-defendant murdered the victim. The district court sentenced defendant to death for first-degree murder and to a fixed period of 30 years for rape. Defendant argued that the Idaho death penalty scheme was unconstitutional, that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence certain photographs of the victim's body, that Idaho Code &sect; 18-207, which provided that mental condition should not have been a defense to any charge of criminal conduct, was a denial of due process, and that the use of dual juries in a simultaneous trial of co-defendants deprived defendant of due process. Defendant further asserted that the imposition of the death sentence in his case was violative of the Idaho Constitution because a judge rather than a jury imposed it. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial court correctly determined the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found that the mitigating circumstances had not outweighed the gravity of the aggravating circumstances. The court held that neither the United States Constitution, nor Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 7, required the participation of a jury in the sentencing process in a capital case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant city sought review of the decision of the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Blaine County, which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent company. The company had filed a declaratory judgment action against the city to determine the validity of the City Property Tax Alternatives Act of 1978, Idaho Code &sect; 50-1043 et seq. (Act), its amendments, and the ordinances enacted pursuant to the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The purpose of the Act was to remove from property owners the burden of providing tax dollars for those non-resident services provided by resort communities. The resident population of the city was 550, but during peak season the population jumped to 8,000. The company contended that the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the city, that it was an unconstitutional local or special law, and that it violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Idaho State Constitution and the United States Constitution. The district court found that the Act was unconstitutional because it delegated legislative authority to the city without adequate standards and was, therefore, violative of Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 19. However, on appeal, the court reversed that decision and remanded the case because the court found that there was a rational basis to support the Act and that it was, therefore, not unconstitutional. Specifically, the resort city was burdened by transient populations to a much greater extent than a non-resort city. Further, the company's non-delegation argument failed because that doctrine applied only to administrative law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Finding in favor of the city, the court reversed the judgment of the district court, which had held in favor of the company and found that the Act was unconstitutional. The court remanded the case for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The mayor refused to execute the contract and the power company filed a petition for a writ of mandate. The court held that only illegality of the proposed contract would justify the mayor's refusal to execute the contract after he had received authorization and direction by the city council to do so. The court held that although the power company accrued certain benefits by having some percentage of the supply of the project available to it, the accrual of incidental benefits to the power company as a private enterprise did not invalidate an otherwise constitutional transaction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicants claimed to be a class consisting of all applicants for indigent benefits from the county who were denied benefits. They alleged that Idaho Code &sect; 31-3502, which was adopted by the county, was unconstitutionally being applied to them because of defects in procedural due process. The trial court entered summary judgment by certifying as a class the applicants named and holding that the standards for eligibility contained in the county ordinance were adequate. On appeal, the court affirmed. The standards set by the legislature and reflected in the county ordinance were adequate and no duty existed to publicize the availability of the program. It did not seem unreasonable or unfair to charge residents of the county with the constructive notice of the statutes and ordinances which made the aid available. Governments have provided aid to the poor for centuries and it was common knowledge that all the local, state, and federal governments administered programs to aid the indigent and poor. The county could choose to notify those in need of the availability of aid but the notice was not mandated by due process.</SPAN></P>

The insured was awarded a judgment of $ 150,000 against the other driver, but only received the policy limits. The insured filed an action to recover under his uninsured motorist coverage, and the trial court awarded summary judgment to the insurer. The insured appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that just because the other driver had insufficient funds to compensate the insured for his damages did not mean the other driver was an uninsured motorist. The statutory language was clear, and nothing indicated an intent by the legislature to construe uninsured to also mean underinsured. As the insured's damages were caused by someone who had a policy that complied with statutory requirements, summary judgment for the insurer was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurer in the insured's action to recover under his uninsured motorist policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement with the State, defendant entered a plea of guilty to a violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6605. Defendant then sought review of the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6605. The court declined to be bound by the stipulation that by entry of the plea, defendant was not waiving his right to appeal whether the statute was unconstitutional. Defendant filed a petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">It was specifically stated in the parties' negotiated plea agreement that the State stipulated that by the entry of the plea, defendant was not waiving his right to appeal whether the statute to which he pled guilty was unconstitutional, having previously raised the issue. Refusing to be bound by the stipulation, because it would have required the court to decide a constitutional issue that had not been passed upon by the trial court, the court had affirmed the judgment entered pursuant to that agreement. However, upon rehearing, the court opined that defendant should have had an opportunity to withdraw his plea. Defendant's reliance upon the State's representation that he would have been free on appeal to raise all of his objections to the statute's constitutionality was a reliance upon an &quot;unfulfillable promise.&quot; The shortcoming of the agreement was in the failure to provide for first obtaining a decision from the trial court on the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6605 prior to entering the conditional plea. Because defendant did not know that the court would not deem itself committed by the stipulation, his plea could not have been knowingly and intelligently made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the petition for rehearing and vacated the judgment of conviction.

The District Court of the First Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Kootenai County, granted defendants' motion to dismiss the charges, holding the Act was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face, in violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The state sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's were charged with delivery of drug paraphernalia and possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to deliver, in violation the Act. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment that granted defendants' motion to dismiss the charges. The court held that while the Act was not a model of clarity and conciseness, the Act was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad on its face. The court also held that the Act did not on its face unconstitutionally impair an individual's First Amendment rights. The Act was not facially overbroad because it did not intrude upon a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. The only First Amendment right arguably implicated was that of commercial speech, and the overbreadth doctrine did not apply to commercial speech. Therefore, even if the Act were overbroad, it would have been constitutional. The Act was expressly directed at commercial activity promoting or encouraging illegal drug use, and in such a context commercial speech was not constitutionally protected. The court concluded that the Act was not void-for-vagueness on its face because it was not impermissibly vague in all of its applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Both claimants suffered from physical ailments from exposure to red cedar dust after they were hired at the employer's patio furniture plant. Both filed workers' compensation claims based on occupational disease contentions. The Industrial Commission dismissed each proceeding, ruling that the claimants' diseases were non-acute and that the 60-day exposure requirement of &sect; 72-439 was not met. The court held that the evidence indicated that the ailments developed gradually, over a period of several weeks or months and thus were not acute. A day of exposure, under &sect; 72-439, meant a calendar day of work, regardless of how many hours were worked. A worker was exposed to the hazards of an occupational disease only on those days that he worked within the hazardous environment. The court evaluated whether &sect; 72-439 violated the Equal Protection and Due Process provisions of the United States and Idaho Constitutions by applying the rational basis test. The court held that because it was reasonable for the legislature to impose a time requirement before providing compensation for diseases that took a considerable period of time to develop, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

He then filed a post-conviction petition for relief, challenging the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 20-223. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State. In affirming, the court held that Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 did not unconstitutionally delegate the parole board's decision-making function to an evaluating psychiatrist, but merely required the board to consider the psychiatrist's recommendation in making its independent decision. Further, the court found that as a matter of law, Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder. Finally, the requirements of Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 did not constitute an enhancement of sentence nor did the provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 apply to defendant because of his mental or physical status, and thus, there was no infliction of cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were convicted of grand larceny.

Defendants claimed that the trial court erred in admitting the transcript and in denying a defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from his home. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) because the state's witness refused to testify, he was constitutionally unavailable to be confronted by defendants; but because his statement was made in a police station under a promise of immunity, it was not sufficiently reliable to come within the statement against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule; (2) the trial court's error in admitting the witness's statement was not harmless error; and (3) while there were no exigent circumstances to justify the entry by the police into one of defendant's homes, the evidence seized under a subsequently issued warrant was admissible where the warrant was not obtained by exploitation of any illegality.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers appealed the redetermination decision to the trial court. Under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3049(b), the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the appeal unless the taxpayers first paid the alleged deficiency, or filed a surety bond in double the amount thereof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with three counts of lewd and lascivious conduct upon a minor child under the age of 16 years, in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607, as a result of his involvement with two 14-year-old boys. At trial, defense counsel was not allowed to cross-examine certain prosecution witnesses about their juvenile adjudications. The jury convicted defendant of all three counts. He received three consecutive terms of varying lengths. On appeal, the convictions and sentences were affirmed. The court found that no error resulted from the exclusion of the juvenile adjudications because defendant had not shown that those proceedings provided a reason to commit perjury. Because a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was the only basis for his assertion that one of the boys had falsely charged another person with similar sex acts, evidence relating to that matter was properly excluded. The court found that joinder was appropriate under Idaho Crim. R. 8(a). It also rejected defendant's argument that Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607 was unconstitutionally vague and found no abuse of discretion with regard to his sentence. Finally, no error resulted from the instructions given on lesser included offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The auditorium district imposed a tax at the rate of two percent on the proprietors, and when the proprietors protested the collection of that tax, the auditorium district filed the instant action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the legislative delegation of such taxing power was constitutional. On appeal, the proprietors argued that Idaho Const. art. 7, &sect; 6 prohibited a legislative delegation of the power to impose a sales tax to the auditorium district. Upon review, the court found the proprietors' argument without merit. Certain constitutional standards had to be met in any delegation of legislative authority to a lesser entity of government. Those constitutional standards were met by the adequate safeguards built into the statutes at issue. Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 67-4917A to 67-4917C specifically defined the incidence of the tax, set forth applicable exemptions, set five percent as the maximum amount which may have been imposed, and delineated administration and collection of the tax through incorporation of the Idaho Sales Tax Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The power and light company previously applied to the commission to increase its rates for its customers. The commission authorized an increase in the rates, but by a lesser amount than was requested.

The power and light company later applied to the commission for permission to recover, by means of a surcharge to its customers over a 12-month period, its shortfall of operating revenue that resulted from the commission's error with respect to the calculations of the rate base in its initial order. The commission denied the surcharge request. The court affirmed, holding that the commission, upon prospective modification of its rates due to the court's finding of error with respect to the rate base calculation, did not have the authority to grant surcharges to make up past deficits. The court noted that the power and light company's sole means for obtaining monetary relief was for it to have appealed the commission's initial rate and posted bond to stay the effectiveness of the rate as provided in Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 633-636.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the landowner and ruled that Idaho Code &sect; 36-1604 was constitutional and that the landowner had no duty of care either to warn of or refrain from creating the dangerous condition on its property. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that motorcycling was within the definition of &quot;recreational purposes&quot; of &sect; 36-1604 because the express list therein was not exhaustive and motorcycling for pleasure was sufficiently similar to the activities listed. The court found no ambiguity in the statute or any basis for distinguishing between &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; negligence. The court noted that even if the decedent had implied consent to enter the land, &sect; 36-1604 provided that he was not a &quot;licensee.&quot; The court held that the rational basis test was the appropriate test to review the statute for equal protection analysis.

Defendant also appealed from the 15-year indeterminate sentence that the trial court imposed. Defendant was charged with committing a lewd and lascivious act on a minor in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607.</SPAN></P>

The record of the sentencing hearing showed that the child had the potential for long lasting trauma and serious emotional problems as a result of the criminal act. The defense stipulated that the boy would testify about at least six occasions of sexual contact between defendant and the boy. Defendant's sexual abuse counselor informed the court that if the incidents were true, they revealed an indiscriminate involvement with both male and female children, which posed an increased risk to society. The counselor said that defendant had not disclosed the incidents to her, which indicated that defendant had not fully come to grips with his problem. On review, the court found that although there was some mitigating evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence. Defendant freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty with full knowledge of all the consequences. The language of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607 was not facially vague and gave fair warning as to what acts were proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the citizens' petition, holding that the property deviation in the scheme was not minor and created a prima facie case of discrimination. The court concluded that the officials failed to justify the deviation where the record established no less than 10 alternative plans with minor population deviations that also advanced the same state policies as those advanced in justification of the scheme in question.

The prosecution's theory was that the woman was murdered to keep her from identifying the defendant in another murder. Defendant was not convicted of the first murder. The trial court admitted evidence of the first murder in the defendant's trial, convicted him of murder, and sentenced him to death. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the court properly instructed the jury on the state's burden in a case resting entirely on circumstantial evidence. The court determined that the given instruction sufficiently informed the jury that it could not convict the defendant unless all the facts were consistent with guilt and excluded any reasonable hypothesis other than guilty. The defendant could be convicted solely on circumstantial evidence. Evidence of the prior murder was admissible to show motive and a common scheme, and establish a rational and cohesive scenario. The evidence did not violate the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights because the murders were separate and distinct crimes separated by time, distance, and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The purchasers bought a home from an owner who had borrowed money from defendant bank.

The purchasers brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the due-on-sale clause was an unreasonable restraint on the alienation of the property and against public policy. The district court found otherwise. On review, the court affirmed, holding that this particular due-on-sale clause was valid and enforceable. The court found that the due-on-sale clause could not be categorized as a direct restraint on alienation. Moreover, even though the due-on-sale clause could affect the ease with which the property could be disposed of, as a matter of law, the clause was neither a direct or indirect restraint on alienation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pretrial detainees in the county jail filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging cell overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, censorship of mail, restriction of visitations, and other deprivations of constitutional rights guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The court affirmed the district court's judgment denying the detainees' petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court concluded that the conditions of crowding which existed in the county jail at the time the action was initiated did in fact fail to met reasonable standards since the detainees were required to spend approximately 22 to 23 hours per day in cells with less than one-fourth the space required by the American Correctional Association standard. However, no grounds for granting habeas corpus remained since the district court failed to order remedial action eliminating the overcrowding. The court found that the screening of mail for escape plans, obscene materials, and contraband furthered a substantial government interest. Also, the visitation rules at the county jail were applied equally to all detainees and there was no evidence that they were being applied arbitrarily or capriciously.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance.

A second test yielded a positive result for the presence of amphetamine. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant as charged. The court held that: (1) it was not necessary for the search warrant affidavit to indicate conclusive test results where there were sufficient other factors such as defendant's statements to the store clerk from which the magistrate could determine that there was probable cause; and (2) prosecutor's statement that certain testimony was uncontradicted was not an impermissible reference to the defendant's failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

During a campus controversy, the employee made some public statements. Two newspaper articles were published which indicated that the employee had made racist statements.

The employee was granted a formal hearing by the board, and the board upheld the discharge. The employee appealed, and the trial court affirmed the board's order.

The court held that the employee's position as chief of security was that of a &quot;director&quot;, making him exempt from the civil service protections, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 67-5303(i). Because he was employed pursuant to a contract, the employee could only be terminated for good cause. The court held that &quot;good cause&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and that the employer had good cause to terminate the employee.

The city moved for summary judgment, claiming that there was no genuine issues of fact, that they had complied with statutory procedures governing creation of LIDs, that provisions of the statute have been held to be constitutional, and that by failing to commence their action within 30 days after publication as required by Idaho Code &sect; 50-1727 plaintiffs were barred from suing. The trial court granted the city summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that the attack on the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 50-1709 required no factual determinations beyond those already established and that there were no material issues to be resolved, given the city's adherence to the procedures called for creating an LID. Further, plaintiffs' action was not barred by the 30-day limitation period, as that period applied to an attack on an ordinance, not on the authorizing statute.

Idaho Code &sect; 19-4514(1), which provided for the warrantless arrest of a person charged with a felony by the courts of another state, did not support a warrantless entry into a defendant's private residence in order to make an arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court concluded that a redistricting plan could be adopted with only minor variations in population, but which would follow county boundary lines and thus accommodate both state and federal constitutional requirements. However, the court ultimately agreed with the interpretation of the Idaho Constitution urged by the city, which would prohibit the division of counties in the formation of legislative districts only where more than one county constituted a district. As a result, the court held that, on remand, defendants would have the opportunity to file their answers asserting any defenses and to submit additional evidence on the issue of the constitutionality of the bill.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of the county after determining that the ordinances in question did not result in a taking of the owners' property without just compensation in violation of the federal or state constitutions. The court also found the owners did not state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and that the owners' contentions that they were denied due process and equal protection were without merit. The court held that the owners participated in various hearings before the zoning commission, but chose not to exhaust their remedies under the Local Planning Act, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 67-6501 to 67-6533.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant cattle ranchers sought review of a declaratory judgment from an Idaho trial court finding that Benewah County, Idaho, Ordinance No. 13, which prohibited livestock from running at large or grazing on property other than that of the owner and which required the erection and maintenance of fences by owners of livestock, was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prior to the enactment of the ordinance, cattle and other livestock had freely roamed and grazed on unenclosed lands within the county. The ranchers asserted that the county had no authority to prohibit open range grazing throughout the county unless herd districts were created pursuant to Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 25-2401 through 25-2409. The court concluded, however, that the legislature had not preempted the field of livestock control. The herd district statutes did not apply to open range areas. Accordingly, counties and municipalities could validly exercise their police powers to prohibit free roaming livestock. Although the ordinance improperly attempted to exercise authority over lands located within incorporated cities located in the county, that did not invalidate the ordinance or make it ineffective in the balance of the county. Finding that the ordinance was not unreasonable or arbitrary, the court observed that the judiciary should not interfere with policy determinations of legislative bodies as to how best to solve problems.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the taxpayers' argument and affirmed the judgments. The court explained that the taxpayers' protests to the assessments were properly denied because the market value of the subject property for assessment purposes was properly determined by the county board of equalization as the reappraisal value on the completed improvements. The court found that the reappraisal was not precluded as urged by the taxpayers because the legislative changes made to the applicable statute applied retroactively. The court explained that as a result, the taxpayers' property value was determined by reference to the subsequently enacted statute which rendered the reappraisal proper. The court found that the legislature intended reappraisal for property that had increased value for reasons such as zoning change, development, and new construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After it was determined that gross inequities existed in property tax valuation for the subject county, a three-year revaluation plan was designed to revalue all the property in the county on a staggered basis. The taxing authorities entered into contracts with the appraiser to establish the market value of all the property within the county. In their multi-count complaint, the taxpayers, who were property owners in the county, alleged, inter alia, that the contracts entered into with the appraiser were invalid and that the 1978 assessment and classification of real property in the county was arbitrary and capricious. After granting the taxpayers' motion to certify a class action, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the authorities and the appraiser as to the counts related to the validity of the contracts. The court affirmed. The court held that where the expenditures provided for in the contracts were mandated by Idaho law, the contracts did not violate Idaho Const. art. 8, &sect; 3. It also ruled that the contracts were exempt from the state's public bidding requirements, and that the revaluation plan itself was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellants claimed that Idaho Code &sect; 42-1736 was a constitutional exercise of legislative authority and that the legislature had the authority under &sect; 42-1736 to formulate the state water plan. The court held that the Board was the state &quot;water resource agency&quot; contemplated by Idaho Const. art.

Thus, Idaho Code &sect; 42-1736B(2), which provided that all water plans proposed by the Board were subject to review and approval of the legislature, unconstitutionally infringed on the Board's authority to determine the state water plan, and was therefore invalid.

The court stated that the seller charged 1 1/2 percent per month on the balances that remained unpaid after 30 days past the due date of outstanding accounts. This late charge was included on the seller's monthly billing statements. The record contained no evidence that the buyer objected to the charge until filing its counterclaim. In addition, the record contained no evidence establishing that the seller agreed to extend the time for payment of the account or to forgo collection of the debt or to forbear on its demand for immediate payment. The court held that the seller's charge of one and one-half percent per month late charge on the buyer's past due accounts did not constitute a forbearance of an existing debt and, thus, did not fall within the perimeters of the usury laws.

The areas of city impact adopted were in conflict and the ordinances resulted in overlapping impact area boundaries. The objecting city objected to the adjustments recommended by the county and instituted an action requesting the adjustment of the neighboring city's area of impact. While the action was pending, Idaho Code &sect; 67-6526 was amended, eliminating recourse to district court as a means of settling overlapping impact area disputes. The neighboring city filed a motion to compel election pursuant to the statute as amended. The trial court instead dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The objecting city lacked standing to assert the rights of property owners in the overlapping impact area and the objecting city itself had no vested rights that permitted it to bring the action. The objecting city could not availing itself of the benefits of the Act by establishing impact areas pursuant to the Aact and simultaneously contend that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter the Treasurer filed a supplemental complaint seeking an order requiring the Board of Examiners to allow claims for alleged losses suffered in the previous year she had calculated utilizing a different accounting method, and requiring the Legislature to reimburse the fund the amount of such losses. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Treasurer. On appeal, the court ruled the method used to compute losses as codified in Idaho Code &sect; 57-724 did not violate its constitutional mandate. The court held that to require the Legislature to make up losses incurred on each security sale might well act to the detriment of the school children of Idaho and that the provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 57-724, which permitted the offsetting of capital gains against capital losses at the end of a four-year accounting period, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

She was given her Miranda rights at the beginning of the interview.

The trial court suppressed, on grounds of involuntariness, the entire tape recording and transcript of the interview, as well as the substance of the latter two-thirds of the interview, but allowed officers to testify to defendant's statements made in the first one-third of the interview. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the Miranda warnings were valid and did not need to be repeated when defendant was informed she was under arrest, the issue of probable cause to proceed to trial was rendered moot by the fact that defendant received a fair trial, and defendant waived any appellate challenge to the jury panel by failing to exercise her available means to challenge unacceptable jurors during voir dire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State filed a criminal complaint against defendant charging him with the crime of burglary in the first degree. Defendant testified in his own behalf to the effect that a person whom he refused to identify had informed him of the store owner who then hired him to break into the store. On cross examination, defendant, relying on the fifth amendment, refused to identify who had initially informed him of the job. The trial court ruled that defendant had opened the subject on direct examination and it ordered defendant to answer, which he refused to do. The jury was unable to reach a verdict. The court, on its own motion, declared a mistrial and set a date for a second trial. Defendant was found in contempt of the trial court. A second trial was held and defendant was found guilty of first degree burglary. Defendant appealed and the court determined that more than six months of the seven and one-half month period between defendant's trials could be attributed to defendant's refusal to answer the questions asked of him on cross examination. The court concluded that neither of defendant's rights to speedy trial or against double jeopardy were violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, a retailer of beer, filed a declaratory judgment action against respondents, the county commissioners, the county clerk, the sheriff, and the county itself, seeking to invalidate a county ordinance prohibiting the sale and possession of kegs of beer. The district court (Idaho) declared the ordinance valid and enforceable and granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. The retailer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondents first argued that the declaratory judgment action was improper because the retailer was attempting to establish his right to sell beer in kegs under Idaho Code &sect; 23-1007, which referred only to wholesalers and dealers. The court disagreed, finding that the retailer merely cited Idaho Code &sect; 23-1007 to show that the ordinance was invalid because &sect; 23-1007 gave him the right to sell beer in kegs and the ordinance, Franklin County, Idaho, Ordinance No. 80-1, prohibited the sale of beer in kegs. Therefore, the retailer was a proper party under Idaho Code &sect; 10-1202 to challenge the validity of the ordinance. The court rejected the retailer's challenge to the ordinance, however. Although Idaho Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, precluded the county from passing an ordinance that applied in incorporated municipalities within the county, the ordinance's failure to exclude the municipalities did not render it invalid.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. The court affirmed, finding that the requirement did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Strict scrutiny did not apply because the relationship between eligibility for appointment and the right to travel was indirect and remote, and eligibility did not implicate voting rights. Applying the traditional test, the requirement was rational to insure that the potential appointee had been exposed to the issues of planning and zoning and to allow the governing board to gain firsthand knowledge about his or her expertise. The requirement did not violate the Due Process Clauses because candidacy for an appointive position was not a fundamental right and interested new residents were able to participate in zoning decisions at meetings and hearings.

Requiring only business that both sold liquor and allowed dancing to obtain a &quot;dance hall&quot; license was rationally based on a perceived difference in the likelihood of public disturbances there, in comparison to a business that sold liquor and did not allow dancing. Also, defendant did not adequately substantiate his claims of selective enforcement and/or prosecution to support his allegation that the ordinance was discriminatorily applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff non Native-American husband and defendant Native-American wife cross appealed a district court decision, which overturned a magistrate's order which had permitted an offsetting financial award to be paid over a number of years and regarding the invalidity of the adoption of the parties' fourth child, but affirmed it in all other regards. The court affirmed, holding the action was specifically authorized by Pub. L. No. 280, and it was not prohibited by the exceptions to jurisdiction in that Act. The trial court's action violated neither applicable test; and the terms of 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 181 and 194 did not alter the trial court's conclusion. The trust grazing lands held in defendant's name were clearly purchased with proceeds of the cattle operation, which was properly a community asset. Hence, under federal and state Indian law and Idaho community property law, the trial court did not err in awarding plaintiff his share of the community funds used to purchase that trust land. Plaintiff failed to show that the tribal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and therefore the validity of the adoption could not now be attacked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the order in all respects, holding that the separate estate of defendant wife was not entitled to reimbursement because she failed to show that $ 2,000 was traceable into the cattle operation. Plaintiff was estopped from challenging the validity of the tribal court's adoption proceedings and the causes was remanded to the district court with orders to remand for a determination of child support for the parties' adopted child.</SPAN></P>

The railroads objected, and a formal hearing was held before the commission, which upheld the values. The railroads paid their taxes under protest. Unsure of whether to appeal to the board or the district court, the railroads filed simultaneous appeals to the board pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 63-3811 and one to the district court pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 67-5215. The district court determined that the railroads' proper avenue for appeal, as utility taxpayers who were dissatisfied with the commission's valuation of their statewide operating property, was to the board pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 63-3811. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that &sect; 63-811 was the remedy whereby taxpayers such as the railroads, who were assessed on a statewide basis, could obtain review of the commission's valuation of their operating property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After adjudication resulted in the change of custody of the minor children to the father, the mother brought this action, based on the state employees' alleged disclosure of confidential records during the proceedings. The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint as to the employees in their individual and official capacities under Idaho Code &sect; 6-905, which required timely notice of claim as a mandatory condition precedent to bringing suit against the state or its employees. The court noted that the claim requirements of &sect; 6-905 were inapplicable to the cause of action brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court correctly held that the employees were immune from liability under &sect; 1983 for their testimony in the custody proceedings based on the absolute privilege for statements made during judicial proceedings. Moreover, the affidavit filed by one of the state employees in the custody proceedings was clearly relevant to the issue under inquiry and also was covered by the absolute privilege.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The husband contended that the classification of &sect; 32-706, which had since been repealed, discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United and Idaho Constitutions. The husband further contended that subsequent to the district court's decision that awarded the wife alimony and attorney's fees, the Supreme Court held that a similar Alabama statute that provided alimony for needy wives, but not needy husbands, was not substantially related to the achievement of important governmental objectives. Thus, the court held that &sect; 32-706 was unconstitutional. The court then held that the decision was to be applied prospectively because since the legislature enacted a new statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 32-705 (1980), which indicated the purpose of the statute was to extend the purposes of alimony not abolish, therefore &sect; 32-706 should not have been abolished or voided and affirmed the alimony award.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Several inmates who had been committed to a mental hospital after they were acquitted of criminal charges under Idaho Code &sect; 18-214, by reason of mental disease or defect, sought release from the hospital by petitioning for habeas corpus. They argued that having been acquitted, they could not be deprived of their liberty except upon a judicial determination supported by adequate proof that they were then &quot;presently&quot; mentally ill and dangerous. The court first held that the trial court erred in quashing the writs without reaching the merits of the inmates' constitutional claims, but that error did not require reversal. Petitioners' assertion of the defense of mental disease or defect and their acquittals on that basis established that they committed otherwise criminal acts while suffering from a mental disease or defect, and a presumption arose that they continued to suffer from the disease or defect until they were able to prove otherwise. Since petitioners' situation was distinguishable from that of involuntarily committed non-criminals, reasonable differences in the procedures for obtaining release did not violate constitutional guarantees of due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient was hospitalized in the custody of the department pursuant to a judicial hospitalization order. The patient was subsequently placed on outpatient status, but was then summarily rehospitalized. At issue on the patient's appeal was whether, under due process principles, she was entitled to written notice and a hearing prior to the revocation of her outpatient status. The department argued that the summary procedure for revocation of an improved patient's outpatient status contained in Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 66-338(b), 66-339 (1974) withstood due process scrutiny because the state's interest outweighed any deprivation to a rehospitalized patient and the provisions for post-rehospitalization judicial review, together with the availability of habeas corpus proceedings, provided adequate safeguards against arbitrary state action. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the patient was entitled to mandatory notice and a hearing as soon as was reasonably possible after her rehospitalization. Hence, on the face of her petition for a writ of habeas corpus the patient sufficiently stated grounds for its issuance to examine whether her constitutionally protected rights were breached.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted defendant's motion to suppress. The state contended that this was in error. The court determined that the original search constituted a private search and that a warrant was therefore not required. The court found that the officials had continued custody over the contraband once it was originally seized. The court also found that the multiple hearsay created by the communications between officials in different areas of the country qualified as an exception to the hearsay rule because there was a basis for each declarant's knowledge, and each declarant's reliability was established.

At a later trial, the court divided the property, ordered the husband to pay alimony and child support, and a portion of the ex-wife's attorney fees.

The clinic experienced many problems with the construction and filed suit. The trial court held that the clinic's contract action was barred five years after completion of the work, the tort action was barred eight years after completion of the work, and because the lawsuit was instituted over eight years after completion of the work, the entire cause of action was barred by the statutes of limitation. On appeal, the court reversed a portion of the action for further proceedings upon which findings of fact could be based regarding the architect's action, statements, and concealments, if any, and whether they constituted estoppel of the architect from relying on the statutes of limitations. The allegations of the clinic that the architect was estopped to rely upon the statute of limitations related only to those problems caused by defective planning for expansion and contraction of brickwork. The court rejected the clinic's additional assertions that the statutes of limitation and the statutes relating to the accrual of causes of action were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the Bingham County, Idaho, Board of County Commissioners, appealed an order of a district court (Idaho), which required the County to grant an application filed by plaintiff hospital corporation under the Idaho Medical Indigency Act (Act) for payment for medical services on behalf of two indigent patients, who were illegal aliens. The main issue was whether the Act violated Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4 and Idaho Const. art. XII, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court held that the district court's finding that the Act served a public purpose was not enough in itself to uphold its constitutionality. However, the court considered whether the district court's order was correct despite that improper basis. The court examined the intent of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of Idaho (1889) in order to determine if, in Idaho Const. arts. VIII, &sect; 4 and XII, &sect; 4, they meant to prohibit counties from reimbursing hospitals for the care of indigents. The court concluded that the delegates to the constitutional convention only sought to prevent private interests from gaining advantage at the expense of the taxpayer. At the time the constitution was adopted, counties were authorized to pay for the care of indigents. It was apparent that the framers of the state constitution did not intend to prohibit aid to indigents. The court held that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant had no standing to raise the claim that Idaho Code &sect; 18-6605, prohibiting the infamous crime against nature, could not constitutionally be applied to consenting adults of the opposite sex, because defendant used force and threats against his victim. The court found that the facts of the case did not come within either of the exceptions to the required standing and that defendant had no standing to assert the alleged overbreadth of the statute proscribing the infamous crime against nature, a statute under which he was neither charged nor convicted.

Prior to trial, counsel for the passenger unsuccessfully attempted to contact counsel for the motorist to engage in settlement negotiations. On the day of trial, the motorist made a settlement offer that was declined. The jury awarded a greater amount to the passenger. The trial court found that liability had never been seriously contested and that the motorist's settlement offer was not reasonable nor in good faith. On appeal, the court held that the record did not support the findings of unreasonableness, and that it was axiomatic that while the trial court had discretion in awarding attorney fees under &sect; 12-121, where the record did not support an award, there had been an abuse of discretion.

Eight years later, the wife petitioned for a modification of the divorce decree, seeking an increase in alimony to $ 2,500 per month; in response, the husband moved to eliminate his alimony obligation altogether. The district court granted the wife's motion by increasing her alimony to $ 1,500 per month solely on the ground of inflation and denied the husband's motion. The husband appealed. While the court affirmed the denial of the husband's motion, it reversed the order increasing the husband's alimony obligation. Inflation, cost-of-living increases, or devaluation of the dollar, however termed, were not sufficient, standing alone and absent any corresponding determination of the correlative needs and abilities of both parties, to modify an award of alimony.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the statute did not by its terms made the carrying of a firearm during a felony a separate felony, nor did it fix a mandatory sentence for such additional crime. The statute did not remove the sentencing court's authority under Idaho Code &sect; 19-2601 to commute, suspend or withhold a sentence. The court held that the statute could be analogized to the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 19-2514, which had been held constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, who was a naturopath, sold prednisolone, and he was charged with the offense of selling a prescription drug without legal authority, under &sect; 37-2210. The trial court held that the statutory procedure under &sect; 37-2210 authorizing the board of pharmacy to classify a drug was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and dismissed the information. On the State's appeal, the case was remanded for trial. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that: (1) whether prednisolone was designated as a controlled substance was a question of law for the trial court, which would judicially notice the drug's classification; (2) the fact that the State's expert witness began her analysis with the assumption that the prednisolone was a drug did not detract from the relevance of the tests she performed or the conclusions she drew therefrom; (3) the dispensation of prescription drugs by naturopaths was not sanctioned; and (4) the accreditation requirement under Idaho Code &sect; 54-1807 (Michie) did not violate due process because it was a rational means of insuring that persons applying for licenses to practice medicine meet minimum standards of competency.</SPAN></P>

The employer contended that the Commission erred in its interpretation of Idaho Code &sect; 72-210 and that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employer applied to the insurer for worker's compensation insurance on April 5, 1977. The employee was injured on the job on May 16, 1977. The insurer denied that any insurance coverage had been procured as of that date and refused to pay the employee's compensation claim. The Commission found that although the employer believed that it had obtained insurance on April 5th, no such insurance policy had been issued by the date of the injury. The Commission awarded the employee benefits and an additional 10 percent under Idaho Code &sect; 72-210, plus costs, for the employers failure to procure insurance. The employer appealed and contended that the Commission misinterpreted the statute, and that it was also unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that the statute specifically imposed penalties on employers who fail to secure payment of compensation. The court held that the legislature intended strict compliance with the statute and the statute required no showing of bad faith as a prerequisite to imposition of the penalty. The court also held that the statute was constitutional and that the employer failed to file its notice of security under Idaho Code &sect; 72-311.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in allowing the preliminary hearing transcript of a witness for the State, who refused to testify at his trial, to be read to the jury over his objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's friend testified at defendant's preliminary hearing that she had stored a stolen stereo system at defendant's request. At defendant's trial for burglary, the friend testified that she had told the truth at the preliminary hearing, but would not reaffirm or disavow her former testimony even after she was granted immunity. Over defendant's objection, the State introduced a transcript of the friend's preliminary hearing testimony. After overruling two prior decisions in which the court held that preliminary hearing testimony by an absent witness violated a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, the court held that the prior testimony was admissible because the declarant was unavailable and her prior testimony in a judicial forum complete with oath, recordation, presence of defendant and counsel, and the opportunity to cross-examine had the necessary indicia of reliability. Because application of the rule it was announcing to the case, however, would be the equivalent of applying an ex post facto law in violation of federal and state constitutional provisions, the court made its ruling prospective only and reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

An Idaho district court sentenced defendant to death after concluding that the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating factors.

He was subsequently sentenced to death. However, no witnesses were presented by either side at defendant's aggravation-mitigation hearing because both parties decided to rely on the record developed during a preliminary hearing. Defendant asserted that Idaho Code &sect; 19-2516 mandated live testimony during the aggravation-mitigation hearing. However, the court concluded that &sect; 19-2516 did not displace the discretion granted to the state, in Idaho Code &sect; 19-2515, on how to proceed at the hearing. The court also rejected defendant's claim that he was denied due process because the state did not formally notify him that it was seeking the death penalty or inform him as to which aggravating factors it would seek to prove. The court concluded that defendant was adequately informed that he could be sentenced to death when he pled guilty and that the state was not required to state which aggravating factors it would argue. Finally the court held that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it failed to specify in writing which mitigating factors it considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent had denied appellant's allegation of assault and battery and had requested attorney fees. Approximately 47 days prior to trial, respondent made an offer of judgment, but appellant refused the offer. After the jury verdict awarding appellant only nominal damages, the trial court held that, under the provisions of Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1)(B), respondent was the prevailing party and awarded him costs and attorney fees. On appeal, the court stated that in considering the relief sought by the respective parties and the relief received by each party, it found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in determining that respondent was the prevailing party. Idaho R. Civ. P. 68 clearly provided that a party tendering offer of judgment was entitled to those costs accrued following his offer of judgment where, as here, the damages awarded were less than the offer of judgment. Furthermore, Idaho Code &sect; 12-121, under which respondent had claimed attorney fees, also authorized the trial judge to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. Affirming the judgment, the court held that there was no trial court abuse in either the award of or in the amount of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, ruling that the manifest intention of the 1978 amendment was to permit a purchaser of beer for on-premises consumption a reasonable amount of time to finish his beer after closing. It had nothing to do with the right of cities to regulate the Sunday sale of packaged beer for off-premises consumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state filed suit against the partners under the Idaho Dredge and Placer Mining Protection Act (Act), Idaho Code &sect; 47-1312 et seq., seeking to enjoin their mining activities until they secured a permit under the Act and seeking restoration of the area already impacted by the mining. The court reversed the district court's original ruling that the Act was unconstitutional. On remand, the district court enjoined the partners from further operations until they secured a permit, required them to restore the impacted area, and ruled that a lien for the state's costs if it had to implement restoration in the partners' stead would be imposed on the partners' claims and equipment. One partner was found in contempt for conducting some earth moving activity at the site. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence did not support the partners' claim that the restoration requirements would make it impossible for them to exercise their federal mining rights. The court ruled that nothing in Idaho Code &sect; 47-1314 limited restoration to that period after mining operations concluded. The court held that the lien was a proper exercise of the court's powers to ensure compliance with its orders.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in considerations as made by the Commission in what it perceived as a need to develop new rate designs which would be responsive to current economic realities. The Commission identified primary objectives of current utility rate design and properly acted within its authority in making its considerations in light of current political, economic and environmental realities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The debtor purchased two combines and a tractor under installment contracts. When he did not keep the account current, the creditor sought a deficiency judgment based on the claim and delivery statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 8-301 et seq. Then, the sheriff entered the debtor's farm and took possession of the tractor. Later, he took possession of a combine, which was on a third party's farm and was padlocked. The creditor sold the equipment before the debtor's redemptive period expired. The debtor filed a counterclaim for unconstitutional seizure under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held the statute was unconstitutional. On remand, the district court denied the creditor's claim for a deficiency and awarded punitive damages to the debtor. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, remanded, and held that: (1) the repossession, in relying on the statute that was declared unconstitutional, was improper; (2) the creditor was entitled to nominal damages only because he alleged he was aggrieved by the fact, not by the method, of repossession; and (3) punitive damages was not awardable because the creditor's conduct did not amount to an extreme deviation from reasonable standards of conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the district court's judgment denying the creditor's claim for a deficiency judgment and remanded to the district court to determine whether the creditor was entitled to a deficiency judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged in 1972 with rape. A court appointed psychiatrist reported that defendant was competent to stand trial, but lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds of mental disease or defect, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 18-213. The unopposed motion was granted and defendant was placed in a mental health facility. Defendant escaped in 1973. He was charged in a rape and second degree kidnapping case in which he again asserted the mental illness defense. That unopposed motion was granted. When defendant filed an application in 1975 for conditional release, the trial court was told that defendant was not mentally ill. The trial court thereafter granted the state's motion to set aside the acquittals and he was convicted for the 1973 offenses. On appeal, the court reversed because the trial court lacked authority to reopen the criminal proceedings. The state was estopped by its conduct to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 18-213 and defendant had not conducted a fraud on the court by cleverly invoking &sect; 18-213 to his own ends.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers alleged that the plan violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution, Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 5, and former Idaho Code &sect; 63-221 (amended 1979 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 18, &sect; 3, p. 26).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A county's tax assessor established a plan to revalue certain taxable property in certain areas at 80 percent of market value in 1977, to revalue the remainder, except for commercial improvements, at 80 percent in 1978, and to revalue all taxable county property at 100 percent of market value in 1979. The taxpayers protested the plan, the equalization board upheld the plan, the Board reversed, and a district court upheld the plan. On appeal, the court held that former Idaho Code &sect; 63-221 required only that the property be revalued every five years and that a multi-year revaluation plan did not violate either the U.S. or the Idaho constitutions merely because only part of the property in a county was revalued in a given year. Because the taxable property in the county had not been revalued for over 20 years, because the revaluation corrected gross inequities first in those areas where prior disparities were most prevalent, because it would have been impossible for the assessor to have revalued all the taxable property in one year's time, and because the temporary disparities existed for only one year, the plan did not violate the U.S. or the Idaho constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that defendant was entitled to counsel and that the public defender was appointed as his counsel. The court held that defendant was entitled to reasonably competent assistance of an attorney acting as his diligent, conscientious advocate. The court found that the trial court ruled that defendant was receiving the assistance of competent counsel, and that nothing in the record indicated any error in that ruling. The court held that the sole apparent basis for defendant's desire for a substitute attorney was that his appointed counsel had discussed with him the advisability of entering a guilty plea and had not secured the appointment of an investigator. The court held that defense counsel might have been derelict in failing to so advise his client in the hopes of entering into a plea bargain for the reduction of charges, reduction of sentence, or other possible benefits. The record demonstrated that the trial judge repeatedly and meticulously sought to dissuade defendant from his decision to waive counsel. The court held that the state's witnesses were not accomplices, but that even if they were, the record demonstrated ample corroboration.</SPAN></P>

The robbery had occurred about one hour earlier when a man walked into the store. The man was casually observed by a store clerk. The clerk rang up the man's sale, and the cash drawer automatically opened. She turned to complete the sale and as she did so, the man pulled a ski mask over his face and placed his right hand into his coat pocket. The man grabbed the money in the cash drawer and ran out the front door. A suspect was observed fleeing in a pickup truck, the description of which matched the defendant's pickup. He was arrested shortly thereafter and charged with the crime of robbery. During his jury trial, the clerk identified him as the man who robbed the store. Defendant then took the stand and answered affirmatively when he was asked if he had ever been convicted of a felony. He was then convicted of the crime. The court affirmed the conviction, by holding that defendant was properly impeached by the use of his prior felony conviction because the court had the inherent power to promulgate procedural rules and to establish rules of evidence.</SPAN></P>

The patent and his wife filed suit against the doctor alleging that the doctor deviated from the proper standard of care, breached warranties, and failed to inform the patient of the risks of the surgery. Based on affidavits submitted by other doctors, the district court granted the doctor summary judgment. The court affirmed as to the warranty and standard of care claims, but reversed and remanded as to the informed consent claim. The court held that there was no retroactive change in the standard of proof because the recently enacted statutory law was simply a codification of existing law, thus no equal protection or due process right was violated..

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The husband filed a divorce action alleging that the house was his sole and separate property. The magistrate granted the divorce and concluded that the residence was marital property. The husband appealed, the district court ordered a trial de novo, pursuant to Idaho R. Civ. P. 83(u)(1), and the wife appealed. In dismissing the appeal, the court held that notwithstanding the district court's terminology, the effect of its decision was clear: the district court was to retain jurisdiction and conduct a trial de novo to finally settle a controversy which, on the state of the record and in view of the nature of the findings of the magistrate below, was not susceptible of final resolution. The order for a trial de novo, which the district court was empowered to enter, precluded the decision from being appealable. The paramount order was for a trial de novo, which was not an appealable order under Idaho App. R. 11(a)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The renters contracted to lease real property from a corporation. The renters also purchased all the cattle, equipment, and hay thereon. The renters became unable to meet the rent due and they sold the cattle back to the corporation. Those proceeds were applied to the rent and the interest on the bank loan. The corporation then sold the cattle to the cattle owner. The corporation sued the renters to evict them and the renters counterclaimed, claiming an agister's lien for the care and feeding of the cattle. The trial court issued a decision finding the cattle owner liable to the renters for the costs incurred in the care and feeding of the cattle until the owner actually took possession. The cattle owner contended on appeal that the statute granting an agister's lien, Idaho Code &sect; 45-805, was facially unconstitutional because neither actual notice nor an opportunity to be heard was accorded to the owner of the property to be sold. However, here the owner received actual notice of the foreclosure sale and sought and obtained a hearing prior to the time of the proposed sale. Also, the owner stipulated to the issues to be tried, thus having sufficient time to defend the claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, the State Tax Commission, sought review from a declaratory judgment sought and obtained by respondents, a city, school district, and several individual taxpayers, in the district court (Idaho). Following trial, the judgment was issued and it declared that Idaho Code &sect; 63-707 was unconstitutional as violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 18 and art. VII, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district court found no rational basis for the distinction made by Idaho Code &sect; 63-707 between electric utilities and all other utilities for tax apportionment purposes. The district court found that the effect was to arbitrarily favor some citizens and taxing entities of Idaho over others, without any rational or permissible justification. It concluded that because of the unconstitutional statute, the Commission should assess all utilities and apportion the revenues resulting from utility taxation in a consistent manner. On appeal, the issue revolved around the statutorily mandated apportionment of public utility property within various counties and the alleged disproportionate amount of revenue that could be raised by counties and taxing districts because of the greater or lesser amount of operating property apportioned to those entities. The court held that the provisions of &sect; 63-707 requiring a different method for the apportionment of the value of operating property of electric utilities to various taxing districts as contrasted with other utilities and railroad companies did not contravene the requirement of uniformity of taxation found in Idaho Const. art. VII.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer claimed that it suffered discrimination as a result of the method of assessment used by the county assessor. The Board of Tax Appeals found that improvements on residential and farm properties were assessed at 73 percent of their market value, while commercial properties were assessed at 100 percent of the market value of the improvements. In order to achieve uniformity, it ordered that the value of commercial property should be readjusted by reducing the valuation of the improvements by 27 percent. The district court affirmed the order. On appeal by both parties, the court affirmed the decision with respect to the assessment of damages, as the proper formula for recovery of damages was to reduce the aggrieved taxpayer's assessment to the same level as shared by all other property owners. The court reversed on the issue of interest, holding that the taxpayer was entitled to interest on the amount of tax that it overpaid. The taxpayer was not entitled to attorney's fees under the private attorney general theory, even though other taxpayers agreed to be bound by the appeal, as there was no paramount societal interest in the matter being litigated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city passed a resolution by which it increased the rate per foot of water pipe extensions for residential subdivisions. The builder did not question the city's authority to raise the rate, nor the reasonableness of the increase, but rather attacked the procedure by which the act was accomplished. On appeal, the court found that Idaho Const. art. 12, &sect; 2 did not mandate that the municipal action taken by the city could be validly effected only by the enactment of an ordinance. Neither Idaho Const. art. 12, &sect; 12 nor Idaho Code &sect; 50-323 addressed the procedure by which the city could set or increase the rate charged for extending its water mains. The court found no statutory or constitutional provision requiring the city to have acted by establishing an ordinance. Furthermore, the city was not required to give public notice or to hold a public hearing prior to changing its rates. Such action was only required by public utilities. Finally, the policy was not a revenue measure levied against a particular class of citizens, it was merely predicated upon a cost recovery basis.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not consider the claim under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4601 et seq., because the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was not a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A redevelopment authority acquired title to a section of land and prepared to demolish the improvements as part an urban renewal program. The utilities sought and obtained a declaratory judgment to the effect that the redevelopment agency was required to pay the cost of relocating the utility transmission lines in the area. The redevelopment agency appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. Although Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 50-2007(h) and 50-2018(j)(3) permitted payment of such costs, it did not require it, and seemed to be intended to aid those with more substantial property interests. The court noted that the common law rule was that utilities that used public streets for their transmission lines did so as a licensee only. They did not have an easement and therefore did not have a property interest that required compensation. Absent specific legislation to the contrary, the court applied the common law rule. The court remanded for consideration of the Relocation Assistance Act claim, however, holding that HUD was not a necessary party and that the state trial court had concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts to consider that claim.</SPAN></P>

The property owner applied to the board for zoning certificates to raise domestic household pets and to erect single-family dwelling units on the land. The board denied the request and found that the property owner's dog breeding operation constituted a commercial kennel, which was specifically prohibited in an agricultural zone. The board also determined that the property did not have the frontage necessary for issuance of a permit for single-family dwellings. The trial court denied the property owner's writ of mandate to compel the board to issue the certificates, and granted summary judgment in favor of the board in its request for an injunction.

He based this contention on the provision of Idaho Code &sect; 49-1102 that the director of the department of law enforcement could only suspend one's license for a period of six months on a second offense. The defendant argued that the trial court could not impose a longer suspension through the use of probation without extreme exigent circumstances. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the sentence was not an abuse of discretion. The provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 49-1102 related only to the ability of the director of law enforcement to suspend a driver's license. It did not relate to the powers of the court in imposing probation.

The court held that because Idaho Code &sect; 37-2210 was held constitutional, a search warrant based upon the prohibition of possessing certain drugs of the statute was proper, and the evidence obtained was thus admissible. Pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 37-2744(a)(1), forfeitures of drugs held on the effective date of the statute were in order. Thus, it was not necessary for the State to allege or prove that defendant obtained the drugs after the effective date of Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732(c).

He also received probation in Utah on a grand theft auto charge. Defendant had been convicted in Idaho of forgery but was paroled after a year and a half. Defendant was on parole when he entered his guilty plea. The sentencing judge stated that parole or probation was not a viable option and that defendant, although only 25 years of age, had accumulated a bit of criminal history, which limited the possibility of rehabilitation. The judge sentenced defendant to a fixed eight-year term. The court affirmed. Defendant argued that the fixed-term sentencing statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 19-2513A was unconstitutional and violative of Idaho Const. art. 10, &sect; 5 and Idaho Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. The court had considered the question in a prior case, which found that the statutory limitation on parole in Idaho Code &sect; 19-2513A was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute did not prohibit the board of pardons and paroles, charged by Idaho Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officer was only able to subdue defendant with the aid of mace and handcuffs. Defendant argued that it was error to overrule his objection to the admission of certain hearsay testimony given by the arresting officer. He also argued that it was error to admit into evidence a zippered case, containing a pistol. The court affirmed the judgment, finding no errors. The court explained that the officer's statements, which related to his belief that defendant was intoxicated, did not carry any substantial weight in the minds of the jury, given the fact that the jury acquitted defendant of the charge of driving his vehicle while intoxicated. The court concluded that, as the State established that the zippered case and pistol was the same encased pistol that defendant had removed from his car and was carrying when he was arrested, it was not error to admit the zippered case and the pistol into evidence. Although defendant argued that Idaho Code &sect; 18-3302, prohibiting the carrying of a concealed weapon, did not apply to a person when he was on his own premises, the court found no justification or authorization for reading into the statute such an all-encompassing exception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the attending physician told a hospital patient that she was dying of myelogenous leukemia, that it was malignant, and that her only hope of survival was chemotherapy, the nurse took it upon herself to advise the patient that alternative natural treatments were available. Apparently, the nurse also stated that discussing these matters &quot;wasn't exactly ethical.&quot; When the board received complaints from hospital personnel alleging that the nurse had interfered with the physician-patient relationship, a petition for the suspension or revocation of the nurse's license was prepared. Eventually, the board suspended the nurse's license for &quot;unprofessional conduct.&quot; Without opinion, the district court affirmed the suspension. The court reversed and remanded, holding that there was nothing in the statutory definition of &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; which could be said to have adequately warned the nurse of the possibility that her license would be suspended if she engaged in conversations with a patient regarding alternative procedures. In other words, as applied to the nurse's conduct, the statutory proscription against &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; was unconstitutionally void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was a multistate-multinational entity engaged in mining, with its commercial domicile in New York.

The auditor combined with the taxpayer six other corporations, which were all wholly owned subsidiaries of the taxpayer. An apportionment factor was applied to the taxpayer's total business income and the result was that the portion of the taxpayer's business income was subject to Idaho income tax. The taxpayer filed suit against the commission. The trial court held that the commission erred in including dividends, interest, royalties, rents, and capital gains of the taxpayer as business income. On review, the court reversed and held that under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3027(a)(1) business income included not only a corporation's typical earnings from its business activities, but also income from tangible and intangible property if that property and income had the requisite connection with the corporation's trade or business.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the totality of the state's evidence, both circumstantial and direct, offered to prove both elements of the corpus delicti in this case, was such that the jury could have found that the state established the corpus delicti beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court properly denied a motion for change of venue because there had been no showing of a pervasive feeling of hostility or guilt towards defendant as a result of some pretrial publicity.

The court affirmed his conviction but remanded for resentencing. The trial court sentenced defendant to death under the mandatory death penalty statute. Subsequent to defendant's sentencing, the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional such statutes. The statute under which defendant was sentenced was virtually identical to the statute that the Supreme Court found unconstitutional. The court disagreed with defendant's contention that the trial court erred by refusing to permit him to waive his right to a jury trial because Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 did not guarantee the right to waive a jury trial in a felony case. Nor did the trial court err by dismissing for cause two jurors who stated unequivocally that due to their feelings about the death penalty they would not vote to find defendant guilty of first degree murder no matter what the evidence showed. The Supreme Court, however, had held that the exclusion of jurors opposed to capital punishment did not result in an unrepresentative jury on the issue of guilt or substantially increased the risk of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff landowners, who were private parties, appealed a judgment of a trial court (Idaho), which found in favor of defendant landowners in the plaintiffs' action brought under Idaho Code &sect; 7-701(5), seeking to condemn a road right-of-way across defendants' property. The trial court found that plaintiffs had not proven reasonable necessity to condemn the roadway across defendants' land and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court found that the roadway plaintiffs sought to condemn was the most adequate and convenient access to their land, but held that plaintiffs had not proved the necessity to take defendants' land under Idaho Code &sect; 7-704(2). Plaintiffs on appeal challenged the trial court's finding that there were at least two other roads that would provide them access to their land. The court held that plaintiffs demonstrated at trial that it would not be possible to traverse the canyon severing the northern and southern parts of their land and the trial court held that it would not be reasonable or feasible to require them to construct such a road. However, defendants alleged that plaintiffs had alternative means of access and produced evidence of such alternative means, including one road then in use by plaintiffs pursuant to a license agreement with other adjoining property owners. Plaintiffs failed to prove that the alternative means of access were not available to them or were not reasonably adequate or sufficient for their purposes. Thus, the evidence supported the trial court's finding that alternative access routes existed and that therefore, a case of necessity did not exist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The non-property owner alleged that because she was denied the right to vote, as a non-property owner, in the district's elections under Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 and Idaho Code &sect; 43-111, she was denied her equal protection rights. In reversing, the court agreed. The court held that the decisive issue presented was whether the circumstances of the case fell within the &quot;special interest&quot; exception to the exacting standard of scrutiny generally applied to such franchise restrictions. The court found that the case did not fall within the &quot;special interest&quot; exception because domestic water service substantially affected not just landowners but all city residents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The effect of the waiver orders was that the State could prosecute defendants as adults. Defendants had previous juvenile adjudications of record and had participated together in a rape and kidnappings after the murder of which they were accused. The court affirmed the orders, holding that the proceedings before the magistrate were constitutionally sufficient even though defendants were not permitted to cross-examine witnesses because the only determination by the magistrate was the existence of probable cause to justify transfer to the adult court. Further, the court rejected the argument of one of the defendants that the district court erred in affirming the waiver because he was less than 16 years old at the time the murder was committed. Although there was conflict between Idaho Code &sect; 16-1806(1)(a) and Idaho Code &sect; 18-216 with respect to the age at which a juvenile could be transferred for trial as an adult, Idaho Code &sect; 16-1806 and its antecedents were intended to implement the statutory provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 18-216, which was the operative statute in resolving whether a child could be tried as an adult and permitted transfer after the age of 14.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A reservoir district proposed, and voters approved, a plan to construct and finance a new hydroelectric dam. Appellants filed a declaratory judgment action and sought judicial review under Idaho Code &sect; 43-2204. The district court dismissed the declaratory judgment action and issued a judgment confirming the actions taken and contracts entered into in connection with the plan. On appeal, the court affirmed and dismissed the declaratory judgment action as moot. Appellants did not satisfy requirements for a class action. The district court confirmation proceedings were proper. Questions of costs and allocations were nonreviewable political questions. The enabling legislation did not impose an agency relationship between the parties, establish a new, unconstitutional entity, violate due process, or grant unconstitutionally broad authority, and it was constitutionally sufficient in form. The district court did not improperly delegate its factual findings or legal conclusions. The bond issue was not an unlawful extension of the irrigation districts' credit.

On appeal the injured party alleged that the exception in &sect; 5-239 did not require a plaintiff to have been an Idaho resident when his cause of action accrued but only when he filed the action, and &sect; 5-239, as construed by the district court, was unconstitutional because it burdened the right to travel and violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that under the exception to &sect; 5-239, Idaho's statute of limitations only applied if a plaintiff was an Idaho citizen when the cause of action accrued.

The trial court withheld the drawer's judgment of conviction for a misdemeanor check charge but imposed a jail sentence of 30 days and a probation period of 2 years. The trial court also withheld the absconder's judgment of conviction for fraudulent procurement of food but imposed a one-day jail sentence and ordered restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The drawer pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor check charge.

The absconder was found guilty of fraudulent procurement of food under Idaho Code &sect; 18-3107. His judgment of conviction was withheld upon the condition that the absconder serve a one-day jail sentence and that he make restitution. In a consolidated appeal, the court held that the trial court's orders withholding judgment but imposing sanctions were final judgments for the appeal purposes because the court looked to the practical effects of the orders, regardless of the orders' language that no judgment was rendered. The court affirmed the drawer's sentence because the sentencing alternatives of Idaho Code &sect; 19-2601 became available to the trial court after the drawer's guilty plea was entered. Moreover, whether judgment was formally entered did not affect the availability of certain &sect; 19-2601 alternatives.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The restaurateur, who held state, county, and municipal retail beer and wine licenses, was denied a state retail liquor license that would have allowed it to sell liquor by the drink in its club in a city of 1,425 population that already had five liquor licenses. No new liquor licenses were available in the city under Idaho Code &sect; 23-903, and the restaurateur's establishment did not qualify for an exemption under in the statute. The court rejected the restaurateur's contention that the statutory exemptions violated the equal protection clause because not all similarly situated retail establishments were granted exemptions. Recognizing that the classifications established by the statutory exemptions might be &quot;under-inclusive&quot; because they benefitted some persons in a manner which furthered a legitimate public purpose but did not confer the same benefit on others alleged to be similarly situated, the court pointed out that some discrimination was inherent in any legislative attempt to limit the number of retail outlets for liquor by the drink, but legislation was presumed to be constitutional and a mere showing of discrimination was insufficient to defeat the regulatory scheme.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) although defendant asserted as error the breadth of the claimed privilege, anything in the witness's testimony that would exculpate defendant would necessarily fall within the witness's right against self-incrimination; (2) the trial court's ruling on the self-incrimination privilege was not so overly broad as to deny defendant his right to call witnesses; (3) the prosecutor subpoenaing the witness and then deciding, for whatever reason, not to call her was not an abuse of the immunity power because immunity was not involved.</SPAN></P>

The Commission found that the teacher's duties were not covered under Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316 and were specifically exempted from the federal law, Pub. L.

After completing one school year, the teacher sought unemployment benefits under the federal program. The teacher was found to be ineligible for Special Unemployment Assistance. The Industrial Commission denied his claim on appeal after it found that the teacher was specifically exempted under the federal law. The court affirmed, holding that the exemption did not deny the teacher his right to equal protection. There was a rational reason for schoolteachers to be denied benefits between school years. The Special Unemployment Assistance program was set up to counter severe unemployment. Congress did not consider teachers between terms as those facing a severe economic crunch. Therefore, they were not among those the Special Unemployment Assistance program was designed to reach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State had prosecuted defendant for prostitution on the basis of a common law definition of prostitution and did not include any allegation of any specific act done by defendant. The state supreme court held that the amended statute for prostitution, Idaho Code &sect; 18-5613, applied to the case in that a specified act had to be alleged, but the State sought a rehearing, which was granted. The court found that the State failed to use clear and unambiguous language to provide notice of any illegal conduct by defendant since precedent stated that a statute was not to be evaluated in the abstract, but considered with reference to the particular conduct of a defendant. The court found that it had no knowledge of the acts that defendant allegedly performed. Therefore, the statute used by the State for prosecuting defendant for prostitution was void for vagueness and violated defendant's constitutional right to due process of law. However, the amended &sect; 18-5613 proscribed prostitution, which was defined as engaging or offering to engage in defined sexual conduct or defined sexual contact with another person in return for a fee. The court reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that a comprehensive plan was not required to have a separate physical existence, apart from zoning ordinances. The court next rejected the argument that the zoning ordinance arbitrarily restricted development to agricultural and residential uses when the most appropriate use of the land was for commercial services. The court explained that the corporation failed to meet its burden of showing that the ordinance was invalid because the restriction bore a reasonable relation to the goals of promoting low density development outside existing urban areas.</SPAN></P>

A trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him, ruling that the possession of marijuana was not a fundamental right and that defendant failed to show that the proscriptions of the statute were unrelated to the purposes of the statute. Upon conviction of the charge, defendant appealed, arguing that he had a constitutional right of privacy that protected his private possession of small quantities of marijuana in his own home. The court affirmed, noting first that defendant preserved the constitutionality issue even though he pleaded guilty, which normally effected a waiver of certain defenses. The court observed that defendant failed to cite any authority establishing a fundamental right of privacy in the home that was independent of conjunctive constitutional protections. Noting that marijuana possession was not shown to be a fundamental right, the court said that defendant failed in his obligation to meet his burden of demonstrating a lack of rational relation between the proscriptions and purposes of the challenged statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant left her job when her husband was asked to relocate. She was unable to find work at the new location and sought unemployment benefits. Her claim was denied because she had voluntarily terminated her employment without good cause. The court affirmed. The claimant asserted that her termination of employment was not voluntary since she had a compelling need and desire to maintain the family unit and avoid divorce. However, there was no authority to support her position. Her employment was terminated by her own free act for causes over which her employer obviously had no control and which had nothing to do with the conditions of her employment. They were purely personal and subjective reasons which were unique to her. Idaho Code &sect; 72-1366 did not discriminate since it was worded in terms of &quot;spouse.&quot; The statute did not unconstitutionally inhibit the right to travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company had been in operation since before any applicable zoning laws were in effect. After zoning regulations went into effect, the company decided to modernize its plant and applied for a variance. The commissioners granted the variance with the understanding that the company would move its operation from the site within three years. The three years elapsed, and the company had moved a portion of its operations from the site, but contended that the variance was invalid. The trial court ruled in favor of the commissioners, and the company appealed. The court found that the variance was not necessary because the company did not extend or enlarge its facility. The court also found that, because a portion of operations had been moved from the facility, the size of the total operation had actually decreased. The court determined that the commissioners could not predicate the application of a zoning ordinance on a petitioner's erroneous assumption that it was applicable. The court reversed the prior ruling in favor of the commissioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An administrator recommended that the teacher be discharged. The board served a resolution for discharge on him. He requested a hearing, but indicated that he did not want to hear evidence or testimony. He believed that the board had already decided to discharge him and walked out of the hearing. The board voted to discharge him, and he petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel reinstatement. The trial court concluded that the board had complied with Idaho Code &sect; 33-513(4), the state board of education procedures, and that the hearing would have proceeded if the teacher had not left. It held that he had waived his right to a hearing, and the board had acted constitutionally. The teacher appealed. The court agreed that the board had complied with discharge procedures, at least until the teacher left, thereby waiving his right to a hearing. Without refutation of evidence, the requirement that discharge be for cause was satisfied. To the extent that the resolution notice sounded conclusory, it was improper. Yet this was cured when it became clear that a decision had not been made. In affirming denial of his petition, the court held that the board had not violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The inmate escaped from an Idaho correctional facility and was found in another state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate's petition for post-conviction relief was dismissed in a memorandum decision and order. On appeal, the court rejected his contention that the trial court had to give him notice of its intention to dismiss the petition. The applicable statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 19-4906(b) was permissive. Section 19-4906(c) provided authority for summary disposition of a petition for post-conviction relief. Further, the inmate was not prejudiced by the lack of notice because he brought a timely appeal. The court held that Idaho Code &sect; 19-2514, the persistent violator statute, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The fact that the inmate was extradited for the crime of escape did not bar the State from prosecuting him also for the status offense of being a persistent offender because &sect; 19-2514 did not specify a new crime, but merely provided for increased punishment of a person who had three times previously been convicted of a felony.</SPAN></P>

The diabetic argued that Idaho Code &sect; 6-904, which immunized the city from damage claims for false arrest, assault and battery, and negligence in discretionary functions, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The diabetic was arrested by a police officer after he went into insulin shock while operating his car and became unconscious. Alleging no special damages, he thereupon sued the city for false arrest, assault and battery, and the city's negligence in hiring the police officer. On a motion by the city based on the &quot;exceptions&quot; provision of the Idaho Tort Claim Act, Idaho Code &sect; 6-904, the action was dismissed. On appeal the diabetic argued that the court had abolished governmental immunity by a prior judicial decision, the legislature could not constitutionally reenact immunity in violation of the court's decision. The court rejected the diabetic's argument and affirmed. In its earlier decision the court did not rule that sovereign immunity violated the state or federal constitutions, Rather it held that the doctrine as theretofore implemented in Idaho was a common law principle developed by the judiciary and, therefore, could be changed or abolished as any principle of the common law. The legislature having enacted a statute providing for governmental immunity that did not contravene federal or state constitutional provisions, the court had no authority to disregard it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff State challenged a decision of the district court (Idaho) that granted defendant naturopathic physician's motion to dismiss the State's charge of practicing medicine without a license on the basis that Idaho Code &sect; 54-1803 was unconstitutionally vague. The district court held that, absent a statutory definition of naturopathy, there was no way to determine where the protected practice of naturopathy and practice of medicine overlapped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged and convicted of practicing medicine without a license. On appeal, the State contended that the actions of the physician were proscribed by Idaho Code &sect; 54-1803 and that there was no necessity for the court to define the parameters of the practice of naturopathy. The State argued that Idaho Code &sect; 54-1802(a) established the bounds of the practice of medicine, and that anyone who engaged in such practice defined must be licensed under &sect; 54-1803. The physician asserted that under the case of Smith, the practice of naturopathy was a constitutionally protected right, and one could not be required to procure a license to practice medicine. The court agreed that the right to follow a recognized occupation was a right protected by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13, but stated that the broad conclusion reached in Smith that the application of &sect; 54-1802 to naturopathy was unconstitutional was incorrect. The court stated that the important difference in Smith and the instant case was that there were specific practices involved that could encroach upon the practices proscribed in &sect; 54-1802 and that the complaint listed several specific procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties divorced and the mother was awarded custody of the four children. The father later sought unsuccessfully to modify the decree and obtain custody of the children. He again sought to modify the decree and the magistrate court awarded him custody of the two eldest children, giving weight to their preference to live with their father. The mother appealed, and the district court reversed the order, refusing to consider the children's wishes. During the pendency of the father's appeal, the district court awarded him attorney's fees. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the order reversing the custody award in favor of the father and affirmed the award of attorney's fees. The court found that the best interests of a child, like its growth, was a matter of development, and reasoned that a trial de novo was necessary to consider all the relevant factors, including the children's wishes. The court also held that attorney's fees were to be allowed at the discretion of the trial court whenever one parent in a child custody case, whether husband or wife, was found to be unable to proceed without payment of attorney's fees, and when the other parent was able to pay that amount.</SPAN></P>

The water user contended the statute amounted to a deprivation of property without due process of law. The court rejected this challenge on the grounds that the water user had not sufficiently substantiated the existence of his claimed property interest and reversed and remanded. The court concluded there was no procedural due process violation in the actions of the director pursuant to &sect; 42-607. The water user contended that &sect; 42-607 denied him equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother was renting a home owned by her parents at a rental rate that was agreed to be less than fair market value.

On appeal, in discussing the background, purpose, and operation of the ADC program, the court pointed out that it was the need and dependence of the children that determined whether a family qualified for ADC funding. In that context, the court held that the grandparents had no duty to support the children such that the ADC grant could be reduced in consideration of the grandparents' financial situation. It was the needs of a child that raised the possibility that, under &sect;&sect; 56-209, 56-210, certain of the child's relatives might have a duty of support.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the imposition of the consecutive sentence was unduly harsh. Defendant argued that the imposition of the consecutive sentence constituted a cruel and unusual punishment that was prohibited by Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court determined that none of the sentences imposed, when viewed individually, were cruel and unusual because the sentences fell within the limits prescribed by the respective applicable statutes. The court ruled that the discretion to impose the consecutive sentence was vested in the trial court by Idaho Code &sect; 18-308 (amended 1972). The court held that the imposition of the consecutive sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment within the contemplation of Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 6 because such sentence was authorized by statute. The court observed that the trial court exercised its discretion in favor of defendant by ordering the sentence for the assault conviction to be served concurrently with the sentence for the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the husband still received money from a trust and social security in excess of $ 200,000 and could return to his medical practice if necessary. The court found that the wife's income, on the other hand, had been reduced as a result of her mandatory retirement.

The court further found that the Act's requirements of obtaining medical malpractice insurance as a condition to licensure bore a rational relationship to the health and welfare of the citizens of the state by providing protection to patients who might be injured as a result of medical malpractice.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction. The court found no abuse of discretion with respect to the trial court's ruling allowing the use of leading questions. The trial court also found no error with respect to the trial court's refusal to give defendant's requested instruction on the crime of fornication. The court held that fornication was not a necessarily included offense of lewd conduct with a minor because a child under 16 could not as a matter of law give her consent. The court determined that an act of sexual intercourse constituted conduct proscribed by Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607. The court ruled that there was no error with respect to the refusal to instruct on the defense of mistaken belief because there was no evidence to raise the defense. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions.

The fireman asserted that &sect; 72-1429F, as amended in 1973, violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After working as a full time fireman for almost 24 years, the fireman was required to retire due to a non work-related incapacitation. The fireman was awarded retirement benefits in a monthly sum equal to 30 percent of the average paid fireman's weekly wage as prescribed by Idaho Code &sect; 72-1429A. The Commission found that the fireman was entitled to retirement benefits pursuant to &sect; 72-1429F (1973) and that 30 percent of the average paid fireman's salary or wage was the full amount to which he was entitled. On appeal, the fireman argued that he was denied equal protection because the statute's classification of him as an &quot;incapacitated fireman&quot; was not rationally related to the purposes for which the statute was amended. The court agreed, holding that because the 1973 amendments substantially diminished the fireman's retirement benefits simply based upon the date of and reason for his retirement, the amendments violated equal protection. However, because of the severability provision in Idaho Code &sect; 72-1426, only the unconstitutional provision was stricken. The fireman was entitled to a determination of his retirement benefits under the statute prior to its amendment in 1973.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the Commission's order and remanded the matter to the Commission with directions to enter an award of benefits pursuant to the statute as it existed prior to the 1973 amendments.</SPAN></P>

The invitee was injured when she slipped on a concrete walkway provided by the district as she was returning from fish ponds located on the facility, which abutted the walkway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The invitee's accident took place on a road owned and maintained by the district. Even assuming the road was in a dangerous condition, the facility, as an abutting owner, was not liable where it did not cause the dangerous condition. The fact that the invitee was a business invitee of the facility or that the facility derived some benefit from the sidewalk was not material to the facility's liability. In the present case, the alleged condition complained of was created solely by the district. The fact that the invitee was a customer of the facility when the accident occurred did not create a duty in her favor. The court concluded that summary judgment for the facility was properly granted. Furthermore, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the district where the invitee failed to comply with the requirement that a claim against a political subdivision arising under the Idaho Tort Claims Act, Idaho Code &sect; 6-906, be filed within 120 days from the date the claim arose. The fact that the district had substantial actual notice of the injury within the 120-day period did not exempt the invitee from the requirement of filing within the 120-day period under &sect; 6-906.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found in favor of the debtor. On appeal the court reversed the judgment, holding that when the debtor, as a married woman, entered into the contract, the creditor under the contract could execute upon her separate property for the satisfaction of any judgment rendered against her. The court determined that the plain language of Idaho Code &sect; 32-904 provided that a married woman could enter into a contract, with reference to her separate property, in the same manner, and to the same extent, and with like effect, as a married man could in relation to his real and personal property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner was arrested while seated in his automobile, which was parked in the lot of a bank with the engine off. He was arrested for an alleged violation of a city ordinance which prohibited intoxication in a motor vehicle while the vehicle was located upon any public or private road or place. Police agreed to release the petitioner if he agreed to have his picture taken, fingerprints taken, and to sign a uniform complaint and summons. Petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the requirement of having his fingerprints taken was also unconstitutional. The court held that repetition of the term &quot;place&quot; in the ordinance produced a vague, uncertain, and overbroad element to the statute, but that the offensive word could be stricken without affecting the remainder of the statute. The statute thus did not violate Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The ordinance did not attempt to regulate traffic and thus did not violate other statutes. Fingerprinting for purposes of checking the petitioner's prior arrest and the possibility of pending warrants was within the police power.</SPAN></P>

The Secretary was ordered to execute an application for a power license to operate certain power plants in the state, which he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Secretary refused to sign the application because he alleged that the underlying agreement between the Board and the power company was void and illegal. The court affirmed and held that: (1) the agreement's terms, the process that confirmed the agreement, and the operation of the agreement's administrative committee that was established to manage the operation of the agreement complied with relevant state statutes and constitutional provisions; (2) submission to the electorate of Idaho Const. art. XV, &sect; 7, which created the Board, did not violate the restriction in Idaho Const. art. XX, &sect; 2 regarding single subject constitutional amendments; (3) State Water Conservation Board v. Enking, 56 Idaho 722, 58 P.2d 779 (1936), was overruled; and (4) because the state owned the project and the power company only leased two dams from the project, the agreement required modification so that the Board could reject any recommendation from the administrative committee and make ultimate policy decisions or there would have been an unlawful abdication of the Board's constitutional and statutory responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court withdrew its previous opinion. In defendant's appeal, the primary issues involved the adherence by the arresting officers to the Miranda requirements, Idaho Code &sect; 19-615, and Idaho Crim. R. 5(a).The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, holding that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress several of the prosecution's exhibits. Defendant argued that he was not given an oral Miranda warning at the scene of the shooting, or, in the alternative, he was too overcome by grief, fatigue, and alcohol to intelligently and voluntarily waive his rights. Defendant therefore contended that because his original statements were wrongfully acquired, the exhibits consisting of the subsequent written statements and taped interrogation were inadmissible. The court noted that the record revealed that following the shooting defendant was able to summon the authorities, initiate first aid, discuss the event with the police, and attempt to return the weapon to a closet. In addition, the record contained no evidence of coercion. The court held that the trial court's findings as to the Miranda requirements were supported by substantial competent evidence.</SPAN></P>

In their action for divorce, the parties claimed the trial court erred when it divided their property. The parties contested the status of an 80-acre farm, reimbursement for improvements to the farm, and the status of earnings after separation of the parties. The trial court granted the divorce and divided the community property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife instituted an action for divorce and division of property against her husband. The trial court determined the status, valued, and divided their property. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court concluded that: (1) the husband's parents conveyed the farm to him through an oral gift, at a time when he was unmarried, and that the subsequent quitclaim deed executed to both parties, after the marriage, conveyed no title; (2) the wife failed to show improvements to the farm attributable to community expenditures, with the exception of shares in irrigation water; (3) Idaho Code &sect; 32-909 was unconstitutional by including the husband's earnings after separation in the community property, but not the wife's earnings; and (4) the district court properly included personal property the husband purchased after the separation as community property with their valuation fixed as of the time of the trial. The inclusion of all of both spouses' post-separation earnings as community property neither prohibited nor required that they be assigned to the spouse who earned them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant issued a check to his employee for wages earned.

By a second amended information, defendant was charged with uttering a check to the employee as payment for past due wages with intent to defraud the employee in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-3106(b). The district court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that the State had alleged on the face of the information that the check was for payment of a pre-existing indebtedness and a conviction under &sect; 18-3106(b) was impossible because the requisite intent to defraud was rebutted by the check being issued for a pre-existing indebtedness. The court concluded that the check being issued in payment of a pre-existing obligation did not preclude criminal prosecution. In prosecutions under Idaho Code &sect; 18-3106 in which it was alleged that the check in question was given in payment of a pre-existing obligation, the State could not rely on the presumption that the maker had an intent to defraud raised in &sect; 18-3106(d), but had to present evidence proving that defendant had the requisite intent to defraud.</SPAN></P>

After the sale, the sellers received a notice of deficiency from the state tax collector assessing a sales tax of $ 2,987 on the personal property included in the sale. Both parties denied responsibility for the tax. After a levy was made on the sellers' property, the sellers filed suit against the buyers for recovery of the sales tax assessment. The trial court concluded that statements made at the meeting by the sellers committed them to a position of not requiring the buyers to pay the tax and held that the sellers were estopped from asserting their claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, a school district and others, brought an original proceeding in which they sought a writ of mandate against respondent judge. The judge granted a motion to strike by a student (plaintiff below in a personal injury case against the school district) petitioners' defenses relating to the notice of claim requirement under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 6-906 and 6-908 on the basis that the statutory notice period was tolled during the student's minority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The student was injured while participating in a physical education class. He filed a claim for damages a year and a half later but within 120 days of attaining his majority. Petitioners argued that minors were not excluded from the notice requirements of &sect;&sect; 6-906 and 6-908 of the Idaho Tort Claims Act (Act). The court held that the notice requirements of the Act were mandatory in an action against a governmental entity. Idaho Code &sect; 6-907 specifically provided for notice to be given in the case of minors by their representative or attorney. The court further rejected the argument that substantial actual notice acted to exempt application of the notice requirement under the Act. The court overruled Jorstad v. City of Lewiston, 456 P.2d 766 (1969) insofar as the decision held that plaintiffs were exempt from notice of claim requirements because of minority, &quot;substantial actual notice&quot; having been given, or because of the relative size of the governmental units. The court directed the judge to, if necessary, take further proof on whether the student's claim should reasonably have been discovered within a time framework activating the requirements of the notice of claim requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court made permanent the alternative writ insofar as it required the district judge to vacate his order striking all defenses relating to the statutory notice of claim requirement. The court modified the writ insofar as it required the judge to vacate his order denying summary judgment and gave directions to the judge on how to proceed with ruling on the defense motion for summary judgment after further proof was taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the complaint was insufficient, that the evidence was insufficient, and that he was entitled to a trial de novo on appeal to the district court. The court affirmed, holding that a complaint must set out the offense charged with such factual particulars as time, place, and person to enable defendant to understand the character of the complained of offense so as to prepare a defense, and so that conviction would bar a second prosecution for the same offense. In the present case, the complaint clearly recited the public offense as well as facts to support the offense. Second, the court held that the evidence on the record was sufficient to support the verdict. The fact that the trial court did not view videotape that was favorable to defendant did not amount to error because the videotape was taken several hours after defendant's initial arrest. Lastly, the court held that defendant was not entitled to a trial de novo on appeal because the rules of criminal procedure did not provide for a de novo appeal.

The State attempted to introduce evidence that an attorney who had represented defendant's wife in a civil proceeding had spoken to an insurance company that paid defendant a sum of money after the death of his son. The trial court overruled defendant's objection and he was later convicted. Defendant appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the testimony was hearsay since the attorney simply testified what an anonymous woman had told him over the phone and it was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the Idaho State Tax Commission, appealed a judgment of the district court (Idaho), which granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, a manufacturer and a construction company, in an action challenging the Commission's determination that the construction company was liable for use tax on the materials and equipment it used in building a factory for the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The construction company built a factory for the manufacturer. Neither party paid use tax on the material and equipment used to build the factory. Although the Idaho State Tax Commission did not name the manufacturer in its deficiency determination, the manufacturer was joined as a party because it had the ultimate responsibility to pay any taxes found to be due. The court held: (1) the definition of the term &quot;use&quot; contained in 1967 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 290, &sect; 5 was intended to cover the use of materials and equipment such as that made by the construction company and validate the imposition of a use tax against contractors; (2) a subsequent amendment to the definition of the term &quot;use&quot; contained in Idaho Code &sect; 63-3615(b) that expressly excluded a contractor's use of property when such use would have been exempt to a titleholder indicated that the construction company's use of the property was taxable at the time the factory was built, even though the use was exempt to the manufacturer; and (3) the three-year statute of limitations set forth in Idaho Code &sect; 63-3633 was inapplicable, because neither the construction company nor the manufacture had ever filed a return.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, after pleading guilty to the charges of voluntary manslaughter and assault with intent to commit murder, was sentenced to a period not to exceed 10 years on each charge with the terms to run concurrently. Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 20-223, which required a prisoner to serve one-third of his sentence, if convicted of certain crimes, before such prisoner was eligible for parole. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 20-223 did not violate the provisions as to separation of powers found in Idaho Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Granting commutations and pardons, which were within the power of the Idaho State Board of Corrections, were not the equivalent of granting parole, which was within the legislative scope of establishing suitable punishments for various crimes pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 20-201 et seq. In addition, the power of the Board to establish rules and regulations regarding parole was properly granted to the Board by the Legislature. Finally, defendant did not meet his burden of showing the invalidity of Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 by violating Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 2 or Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The father contended that the trial court erred when it denied his demand for a jury trial, and he claimed that Idaho Code &sect; 7-1114 violated Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that a paternity suit was not a common law action and, thus, Idaho Code &sect; 7-1114 was not an unconstitutional deprivation of the right to a jury trial. The father also challenged the trial court's refusal to allow testimony concerning the reputation of the mother as a sexual libertine. The court determined that evidence of the mother's prior chastity or lack thereof was admissible only when such evidence related primarily to the issues of time of access and paternity of the child. Finally, the father asserted that the trial court erred in its decision to appoint a Utah doctor as the expert to perform blood tests under Idaho Code &sect; 7-1116, thus placing the expert beyond the trial court's subpoena power. The court determined that &sect; 7-1116 did not necessarily require a court appearance by the expert and that the father, if not satisfied with the findings of the expert, had authority under &sect; 7-1116 to demand that other experts take independent tests, which he failed to do.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 1 by failing to provide the requisite uniform system of public schools. On appeal, the court applied the rational basis test to analyze the equal protection argument. The court found that the legislature, acting in its plenary capacity to establish and maintain a system of public education, had acted rationally and without unconstitutional discrimination in setting up a system of financing, wherein a large portion of revenues for the public schools were levied and raised by and for the local school districts. Further, the court refused to classify the right to education as a fundamental right which compelled the state, for the purposes of financing, to wipe out local entities and finance on the basis of revenue raised by some sort of statewide system. The court held that neither equal protection nor Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 required that the public schools be financed so that equal amounts were expended per pupil, subject only to variables such as geographic or demographic location.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parents' children were killed in automobile accidents on state roads. Both sets of parents brought wrongful death actions against the state under the Act, alleging slippery road conditions. One action was brought 719 days after the child's death, the other action was brought 296 days after the child's death. The trial court dismissed the parents' actions for failing to comply with the 120-day notice requirement of Idaho Code &sect; 6-905. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that &sect; 6-905 distinguished between two classes of tort claims, those arising from the date a claim arose and those arising when a claim reasonably should have been discovered. However, &sect; 6-905 did not establish a suspect classification or establish a discrimination against one class nor infringe upon a fundamental right. Applying the traditional rational equal protection test, the court held that &sect; 6-905 was constitutional because there were legitimate reasons for the statutory requirement of notice. Finally, Idaho Code &sect; 6-908 was clear that compliance with &sect; 6-905 was mandatory.

However, the court held that the Authority could have issued the bonds to the other hospitals. The Act did not violate the Due Process Clause under U.S. Const. Amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Idaho Legislature enacted Idaho Code &sect; 67-4307 (1971), directing respondent to appropriate in trust unappropriated natural waters for scenic preservation and recreational use. Cross appellant opposed respondent's permit application on grounds that the underlying statute was unconstitutional, scenic beauty and recreation purposes were not beneficial uses, and the proposed permit was impermissible as there was no actual diversion of water. The water agency held the statute constitutional but held that actual diversion was necessary. The lower court held the statute and respondent's intended permit constitutional and held that actual diversion of water was not required. The court affirmed the decision, holding that although the constitution did not expressly state that beauty and recreation purposes were beneficial uses, neither were the constitution's specified uses exclusive. Express authorization for respondents was not required as the scheme was not insidious or attempting water monopoly. The court held that the recent water statute did not mandate actual diversion and that statutory construction gave precedence to the most recent statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A wholesaler of beer contested the reasonableness of two statutes,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 23-1033, 23-1034, which prohibited wholesalers, respectively, from providing financial aid to retail outlets and from cleaning draft beer equipment except in emergency situations. A trial court found that the prohibition against cleaning of draft equipment by wholesalers denied them equal protection of the law and permanently enjoined its enforcement by the State. Subsequently, &sect; 23-1034 was amended so as to delete the emergency provision and allow a wholesaler to clean draft equipment so as to maintain sanitation. Because the controversy as to the statute ceased to exist, the court refused to consider the issue of constitutionality as raised and considered by the trial court, because only a moot question was involved. As to the trial court's determination that Idaho Code &sect; 23-1033 denied equal protection of the laws to wholesalers, in that the statute was unreasonable and did not promote the public health or safety, the court noted that the wholesaler failed to meet its burden of establishing the statute's unconstitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent executed a will in which she left her community property to her husband and her separate property to her daughters from a previous marriage.

Both allowances were taken from the decedent's separate property. The executrix, who was also one of the decedent's daughters, appealed. The court held that the allowances were properly taken from the decedent's separate property. First, the decedent demonstrated testamentary intent to have the allowances taken from her separate property because she failed to include an election clause in the will. Second, neither Idaho Code &sect; 15-2-401 nor Idaho Code &sect; 15-2-402 were vague and uncertain. Idaho Code &sect; 15-2-401 specifically stated that the homestead allowance was in addition to any share that passed to the surviving spouse by a decedent's will.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants sought review of an order of a trial court (Idaho), which entered summary judgment in favor of respondents, the Sate of Idaho and the Idaho State Tax Commission, and dismissed appellants' action. The action challenged the constitutionality of a revenue bill enacted by the Legislature on the basis that the bill was enacted in violation of Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect;&sect; 14, 16 and Idaho Const. art. 4, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The revenue bill at issue originated in the House and was amended in the Senate. The House adopted the Senate amendments. The bill, as sent to the Governor, omitted a section that was in the original and had not been deleted by amendment in either house. On appeal, the court first held that summary judgment was proper. The court used the bill as originally printed and the legislative journals relating to the bill to trace its legislative history. The court held that while Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 14 did not specifically allow the Senate to amend a revenue measure, the section had to be read to permit the Senate to amend such bills. Otherwise, the Senate's only choice would have been to veto the measure. The provision omitted from the document submitted to the Governor for signature was not law because it never received the Governor's signature, as required by Idaho Const. art. 4, &sect; 10. However, the constitutionality of the bill signed by the Governor was not affected. Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 16 was not applicable, even though a reference to the omitted provision remained in the bill's title, because there was nothing in the body of the bill that was not expressed in the title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The treasurer contended that Idaho Code &sect; 57-724, concerning distribution of income from investments and determination of net capital gains or losses, was unconstitutional. The court rejected the treasurer's contention that &sect; 57-724 conflicted with Idaho Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 by failing to provide for losses that occurred prior to 1969. That the statute was not all encompassing did not render it unconstitutional. Furthermore, the statute did not relieve the legislature of its constitutional obligation to supply all losses occurring prior to 1969. For the same reasons, the court rejected the treasurer's contention that the use of &quot;marketable value&quot; as a basis for determining losses, rather than actual acquisition cost, violated Idaho Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 in that &quot;marketable value&quot; failed to provide for &quot;all losses.&quot; The court rejected the treasurer's claim that &sect; 57-724 infringed upon the constitutional duties of the state treasurer by allocating the investment of the school endowment fund to the Investment Board. The treasurer was the custodian of the fund and the legislature directed by law how the fund shall be invested, which was accomplished by the creation of an investment board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The county brought suit, seeking to enjoin and abate the maintenance of a wooden structure as a violation of a zoning ordinance and as a public nuisance. The husband filed an answer and a third-party complaint against the county commissioners and the director of the county planning and zoning commission. The district court granted judgment for the county and enjoined the husband from maintaining the building on their property and denied the relief sought in the third-party complaint. The husband appealed. In a separate action, several owners of property in the vicinity of the husband's property sought to abate the alleged nuisance resulting from the continued maintenance of the wooden structure. The district court found the structure a nuisance and ordered the husband and wife to conform to the zoning ordinance though he argued the structure was an accessory. The court affirmed, holding that an accessory use to a non-conforming use was not authorized and was prohibited by the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The airplane passengers appealed from the denial of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (jnov), which had been denied prior to the grant of the motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The pilot operated an airplane on which the passengers were injured. The passengers sued to recover for personal injuries sustained in the crash against the pilot and the airplane owners. Upon motion for summary judgment, the trial court dismissed the action as to the airplane owners. The passengers filed an amended complaint and further alleged that the accident was also caused by the consumption of intoxicating beverages by the pilot within 12 hours of the flight time. The pilot denied liability and claimed affirmative defenses. The jury found against the passengers in a jnov motion, or in the alternative for a new trial. However, the new trial was granted. Both parties appealed. The pilot challenged the new trial grant. The passengers challenged the denial of the jnov motion. The court affirmed the trial court judgment because the giving of an instruction did not constitute reversible error; instructions given at the end of a trial reciting the allegations found in the parties' pleadings were incorrect since they were not supported by evidence introduced at the trial itself. Also, the guest statute for airplane passengers was held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The corporation, the assignee of a farm equipment sales company, had filed suit pursuant to the Idaho Claim and Delivery Statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 8-306 et seq., as it existed before amendments made by 1973 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 118.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The purchaser bought farm equipment on retail installment contracts. When he got behind on his payments, the company filed suit. Sheriffs, acting under affidavits of possession filed by the company, repossessed the equipment. The purchaser's counterclaim alleged that the seizures were wrongful. On appeal, the court held that the statute in effect at the time of the seizure failed to meet the procedural due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The statute was unconstitutional because it did not provide for judicial supervision of the issuance of the possession order, and lacked any provision for a certain, immediate judicial hearing on the validity of the taking of the property. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute denied the purchaser procedural due process by allowing the ex parte seizure of property through state action. The court rejected the company's contention that the purchaser should have pursued injunctive relief rather than filing a counterclaim for wrong seizure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's summary judgment of dismissal and remanded the cause for further proceedings in conformity with the court's opinion. Costs were awarded to the purchaser.</SPAN></P>
