</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Superior Court, affirming the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which denied appellant's motion to suppress the firearms seized from his residence, claiming that the police should have obtained a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shot and injured his wife at his home. Police arrived, arrested appellant, and removed the wife and son. Having obtained neither a search warrant nor consent, troopers searched the residence. Prior to trial, appellant unsuccessfully moved to suppress the firearms seized, and appellant was convicted. The Superior Court affirmed, reasoning that the search was justified pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2711(b), which requires the police to seize weapons used in the commission of certain enumerated offenses, and that the search was also proper due to exigent circumstances. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed, holding that seizure pursuant to &sect; 2711(b) is subject to limitations of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The statute did not authorize warrantless searches whenever a weapon is implicated in a domestic violence case. Further, no exigent circumstances existed, because no danger would have resulted in the delay occasioned by obtaining a warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of the Superior Court reversed, and case remanded for a new trial. The statute which requires police to seize weapons used in the commission of offenses involving domestic violence did not authorize warrantless search. A seizure under the statute is subject to constitutional limitations.</SPAN></P>

Appellee was convicted based on this evidence, and appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from an Order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which held that in her action seeking monetary damages under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 951-962.2 was not entitled to a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought employment discrimination suit against township and its supervisors. After her federal claims were dismissed as time-barred, she proceeded under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA), 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 951-962.2. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that the general assembly's use of the term &quot;court&quot; in the statute was significant. The court held that simply because the PHRA allowed for legal relief did not translate into a legislative intent to provide for a jury trial. The court ruled that jury trials were constitutionally required only where a jury trial for the claim would have been available when the Pennsylvania constitution was adopted. Having determined that no cause of action for sexual discrimination existed at the time of the adoption of the Pennsylvania constitution, the court determined that plaintiff had no right to a jury trial under the PHRA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed holding plaintiff was not entitled to a jury trial for claims arising under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act because the legislature intended judges and not juries to hear claims of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County (Pennsylvania) denying petition for review, contending that trial counsel should have conducted additional investigation on mental health issues, and second that the proportionality review violated appellant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because mentally ill defense can not be raised during the guilt phase, appellant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue this defense. The court found that appellant had not proven that presentation of expert testimony concerning appellant's psychosis would have successfully prevented appellee commonwealth from proving appellant's premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt, because the lower court would not have accepted appellant's defense in light of the other evidence that established appellant's premeditation. The court rejected appellant's challenge to the selection of additional prospective jurors by issuing summonses to people at the mall, because appellant could not establish that the method of selection prejudiced him. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of the aggravating factor of torture because of the number and placement of shots into the victim's body. The court upheld the constitutionality of the proportionality review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because expert testimony of psychosis would not have prevented appellee from proving premeditation due to other evidence which established appellant's premeditation, and thus counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants appealed from the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), presenting constitutional challenges to the imposition of a tax at the one-percent rate established by the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax Act within the context of a real estate transfer in which one party to the transaction is exempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants presented constitutional challenges to the imposition of a tax established by the Pennsylvania Realty Transfer Tax Act, 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8101-C to 81134-C, (Act) within the context of a real estate transfer in which one party to the transaction is exempt. Appellants maintained that the Act discriminated against parties dealing with the federal government in violation of the federal supremacy clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, and that the asserted unequal burden imposed resulted in a violation of principles of uniformity and equal protection. On appeal, the court found that while parties dealing with the federal government encountered a degree of differential treatment in terms of the incidence of taxation under the Act, this difference was without constitutional import, since the economic burden which they bear was deemed to be equivalent. Thus, the taxing scheme under the Act was grounded in a rational basis, as it functioned in a non-discriminatory manner.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. Under Pa. R. Crim.

Since the superior court's error only resulted in the improper exclusion of a four-day period for one appellant, that appellant failed to establish that his trial was held beyond the 365-day deadline. Therefore, he was not entitled to a dismissal. As to second appellant, the Commonwealth was duly diligent in prosecuting appellant and that the delay in starting trial was occasioned by circumstances beyond the control of the Commonwealth.

The court disagreed, holding that homicide by vehicle while DUI required a conviction for DUI pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731and proof that the violation caused the death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver appealed his conviction for homicide by vehicle, failing to drive at safe speed, and careless driving, claiming that because police lacked probable cause, and no exception to the warrant requirement applied, their warrantless searches and seizures of items from his tractor-trailer were unconstitutional. The court found warrantless seizure of the radar detector was permissible under the plain view doctrine. Further, Pennsylvania had a substantial interest in regulating the trucking industry for public safety, but 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. 6308(b) did not authorize an administrative search without a warrant for the items seized in this case; it did not give police unlimited discretion to search a vehicle for evidence of a crime. The closely regulated business exception to the warrant requirement did not apply. The error was harmless, however, because evidence of guilt was so overwhelming that jury would have found appellant guilty even without improperly admitted evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellee moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the stop, claiming that the police had no reasonable suspicion to justify the stop. The motion was denied, but on appeal the lower appellate court reversed, holding that appellee's attempt to avoid the roadblock did not give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct that would justify the stop. Appellant state sought review of the order, contending that the officer was authorized to stop the vehicle because he was engaged in checking vehicles at the roadblock and that avoidance of the roadblock was sufficient justification for the stop. The court held that a vehicle stop at a location away from the roadblock could only be made if the officer had reasonable grounds to suspect a violation and that avoidance of the roadblock alone was not sufficient.

The appellee was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of more than ten years incarceration and ordered to be evaluated as a sexually violent predator under Pennsylvania Megan's Law (the Act), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.6), a statute requiring the registration of sex offenders. The appellee challenged the constitutionality of the sexually violent predator provisions of the Act. The court found that the Act had inadequate due process protection for individuals being evaluated as sexually violent predators. The court determined that the burden of proving an individual to be a sexually violent predator should rest with the prosecution, and not require the individual to attempt to rebut the presumption of his classification as a sexually violent predator. The court therefore struck the sexually violent predator provisions of the Act and remanded to the trial court for disposition of the remainder of the issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Pennsylvania corporation conducted manufacturing operations in Pennsylvania and other states. Appellant was required to pay a capital stock tax on its Pennsylvania headquarters, pursuant to 72 Penn. Stat. &sect; 7602(a). Appellant calculated its capital stock tax as if it were a foreign corporation paying a franchise tax and entitled to manufacturing exemptions, pursuant to 72 Penn. Stat. &sect; 7602(b)(1). After auditing appellant's 1983 tax return, the department of revenue held that appellant was not entitled to the manufacturing exemption as calculated. Appellant sought review of the resettlement, and appellee board of finance and revenue affirmed the recalculation. Appellant filed a petition for review, challenging appellee's order on constitutional and statutory construction grounds, which was denied and affirmed. Appellant filed a direct appeal. The court reversed judgment in favor of appellant and remanded the case for further proceedings because the manufacturing exemption to Pennsylvania's capital stock tax facially discriminated against interstate commerce and afforded preferential treatment to corporations engaged in manufacturing activities in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee borough council entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the borough's police officers, which included terms on wages. The agreement did not include a wage re-opener provision.

When appellee was reorganized, it repudiated the addenda to the agreement. Appellant police officers filed a breach of contract action against appellee. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee. Appellant sought review on the issue of whether Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 26 operated to prohibit a municipality from granting raises to municipal employees who were already covered by an employment contract. The court affirmed judgment for appellee and held that pursuant to Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 26, municipalities, being creatures of the sovereign, were constrained just like the general assembly from allocating extra compensation to public employees already covered by a contract of employment. The court held that municipal corporations had no inherent powers and could do only those things that the legislature authorized.</SPAN></P>

Following the affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct appeal, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief.

On appeal, the court affirmed in part, holding that post-conviction relief was not available to the extent that appellant had asserted general claims of trial error that were not preserved at trial and raised on direct appeal. The court, however, reversed in part and remanded with directions for the lower court to render its own, independent findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning certain claims, including allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court explained that that the independent role of the judiciary was not served by the wholesale adoption of the state's brief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with eight counts of burglary and two counts of receiving stolen property. He pled guilty to all counts and was sentenced to consecutive sentences for a total of 80 years imprisonment. After several proceedings, appellant filed an amended pro se petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-9551, alleging that trial counsel was ineffective for leading him to believe that that his sentence would be shorter. The court denied the petition. The Superior Court affirmed. Appellant filed a second PCRA petition alleging that his guilty plea was unlawful because he was not advised that he could be subject to consecutive sentences. The Court sought to determine whether a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; occurred which would warrant relief on a repetitive PCRA petition, where the record failed to reflect that defendant was made aware of the possibility of consecutive sentences. The court affirmed the order denying post conviction relief. There was not a miscarriage of justice where the record reflected that appellant was aware that he could get consecutive sentences and where appellant failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying appellant's post conviction relief petition because the heavy burden of proof for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the context of a repetitive post conviction relief petition precluded the finding of a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant raised numerous allegations of trial court error and ineffectiveness of trial counsel. The instant court held that the evidence proved that defendant planned and carried out the killing, clearly satisfying statutory elements of first degree murder, and that the evidence was therefore sufficient to sustain the conviction. Further, the court concluded that the trial court exercised its discretion properly when it dismissed certain potential jurors for cause after they answered positively to certain questions. The failure of defendant's counsel's to cross-examine witnesses concerning bias stemming from an outstanding warrant, criminal charges, probations, or paroles did not so prejudice defendant that the result of the trial would have been different if counsel had pursued this line of questioning. Thus, defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was meritless. The record revealed that defendant's death sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and that there was sufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstances found by the jury.</SPAN></P>

I, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, the Press Clause, U.S. Const. amend. I, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tax exemption of appellant commonwealth exempted from sales tax the sale at retail or use of religious publications sold by religious groups and Bibles and religious articles. Petitioners successfully challenged the constitutionality of this exemption as violative of the Establishment Clause, U.S. Const. amend. I. This exemption showed a preference for communication of religious messages as had been held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in a previous case based upon a lack of breadth of coverage. The exemption did not cover a broad secular purpose, such as the publication of philosophical literature distributed by nonreligious organizations devoted to similar subject matters; nr did the exemption allow for the exemption based upon the type of organization that produced it, as opposed to its content. Therefore, summary judgment for petitioners was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment for petitioners was affirmed, where a tax exemption was unconstitutional because it protected the communication of religious messages and lacked a broader secular purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that prevented appellant chiropractors from advertising that they performed physical therapy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him to death upon his conviction for first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found that consolidation of the informations against appellant inmate was proper where the similarities between the crimes were sufficient to establish a sufficient logical connection in the form of a common plan, scheme, or design. The appellate court further found that there was no prosecutorial misconduct where appellant failed to show that the unavoidable effect of the remarks during closing argument was to arouse the jurors' emotions or to prejudice them that so they could not fairly weigh the evidence and return a true verdict. Although the appellate court found that the trial court improperly refused to allow defense counsel to ascertain whether the venireperson would automatically impose a sentence of death if the jury returned a first-degree murder conviction, it then held that a new penalty hearing was unwarranted where the error did not deprive appellant of an impartial trial. The appellate court affirmed, finding that, upon an independent review of the death sentence, the sentence was properly based on the evidence presented at trial and was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the first-degree murder conviction and the death sentence where sufficient evidence existed to show that appellant inmate caused the victim's death during a rape; although trial court erred in refusing to allow the questioning of a venireperson's inability to assess life imprisonment following a first-degree murder conviction, new hearing was unwarranted without a showing that appellant was deprived of an impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a petition for post conviction relief, alleging claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and trial court error. The court denied relieve, holding defendants' claims were either waived, previously litigated or were without merit. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief. The court disagreed with defendant that the Attorney General's office had any actual conflict in the matter. The court also found defendant's claim attacking the effectiveness of his trial counsel was without merit. Defendant did not show that a claimed error in a jury instruction prejudiced him. Trial counsel also articulated a reasonable trial strategy.

Appellant's petition for postconviction relief was denied.

Appellant further argued that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective in failing to pursue the issue of the trial judge's recusal on grounds of federal law. The court ruled that appellant was ineligible for postconviction relief based on his claim that the jury instructions and verdict sheet were unconstitutional pursuant to Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9543 (a)(3) because the court previously addressed the issue on direct appeal. The court affirmed the denial of appellant's petition for postconviction relief and affirmed appellant's conviction and death sentence concluding that his argument for recusal relied entirely on federal statutes and caselaw, which had no application in a case prosecuted in state court.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the record did not support appellant's position that jurors may have been excused for cause after having expressed only generalized opposition to the death penalty. Any request for transcription of the stenographic notes of voir dire would be frivolous where no specific claim of error was made. Life-qualification of jurors was barred by appellant's exhaustion of direct appeals before the rule was announced. Appellant failed to demonstrate the lower court's requirements for the exercise of peremptory challenges undermined reliable adjudication. Claims previously litigated on direct appeal warranted no relief and appellant failed to show he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel.

The petition was not timely; it was not filed within a year of the final judgment, nor could appellant avail himself of the provision allowing for the filing of a first petition within one year of the PCRA's effective date, January 16, 1996, because the instant petition was his second.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the superior court's judgment that defendant's trial counsel had been ineffective. The supreme court declined to impose a more stringent prejudice requirement than that applicable to direct appeals, but, nevertheless, found that defendant failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel was ineffective at trial. The court found that although defense counsel was aware of the agreement the state had with defendant's cellmate, defense counsel did not cross-examine defendant's cellmate concerning the deal he made with the state. However, defense counsel did elicit from the witness other information used to impeach his credibility. The court additionally found that eliciting purportedly damaging testimony from defendant's adoptive father did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. The admission of the testimony had not so prejudiced defendant as to render the verdict unreliable. Defendant failed to establish his counsel's ineffectiveness pursuant to the standard set forth in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9543(a)(2)(ii), therefore, the court reversed the order of the superior court and reinstated the order of the post conviction relief court, and denied relief.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to establish his counsel's ineffectiveness pursuant to the standard set forth in the applicable statute, although the statutory language did not create a higher burden on defendant in his post conviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, executrix of her husband's estate, sought review of an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which dismissed appellant's claim that the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 9101-9196, was unconstitutional in allowing appellee revenue agency to apply a higher tax rate to wrongful death proceeds she received after her husband's 1993 death than the rate applied after the 1995 amendments became effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, executrix of her husband's estate, argued trial court error in dismissing her claim challenging the constitutionality of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 9101-9196, under the uniformity clause of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, simply because appellant did not exhaust her administrative remedies in contesting a lower tax rate applied to wrongful death proceeds attributable to decedents dying after -- but not before -- the 1995 amendments, a rate unavailable to appellant due to her husband's 1993 death. The court agreed, ruling that an administrative appeal would be futile in view of appellant's direct attack on the statutory scheme of taxation, as opposed to an attack on an administrative interpretation. Courts need not adhere to the prescribed administrative process when the claim could only be resolved in a judicial forum. In addressing the uniformity issue, the court upheld the Act as being rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. Use of a decedent's date of death was a legitimate benchmark for inheritance taxation, the court concluded, as it promoted timely, orderly, and efficient revenue collection and estate administration.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the plain language of the statute was not directed at the content of speech, but simply sought to regulate conduct intended to harass another, and that the government had a legitimate interest in preventing the harassment of individuals. The statute was sufficiently specific in stating what was prohibited and thus was not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

The police did not inform defendant that an attorney called him. Defendant confessed that he caused the death of his son. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the conviction, and he was convicted of first-degree murder. The intermediate appellate court affirmed. The court affirmed because the right to counsel under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, was identical to the right to counsel provided by U.S. Const. amend. V and that right did not attach until formal initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings occurred. Because defendant consented to the interview and waived his Miranda rights, his right to counsel was not violated. The court found the expert witness had a reasonable pretension to knowledge in the specialized areas on which he testified, thus, there was no abuse of discretion when the trial court admitted the expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, landlords and landlord associations, sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) holding that the requirements for supersedeas under Pa. R. Civ. P. Dist. J. 1008B violated the appellee low-income tenants' right to a jury trial under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, in a consolidated appeal of nine landlord-tenant cases raising the identical issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, landlords, and landlord associations, challenged an order of the trial court striking down as unconstitutional certain provisions of Pa. R. Civ. P. Dist. J. 1008B, as applied to low-income persons in a landlord-tenant action. Rule 1008B stated that a tenant's appeal from a judgment of a district justice granting possession of the property to the landlord operated as a supersedeas only if the tenant deposited a sum of money with the court. The trial court held that this provision effectively denied a jury trial to those who could not pay arrears and would likely be evicted, thereby violating Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. In reversing, the court held that in balancing the rights of tenants and landlords, the landlord's right to possess and control his property had greater constitutional weight than the tenant's right to a jury trial, and that Rule 1008B did not, therefore, unconstitutionally burden tenants' right to a jury trial or violate their due process rights. The court further held that because the protection of the landlord's property was a rational basis for the requirements of the rule, the provisions did not violate the equal protection rights of low-income tenants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment finding that certain provisions of the rules of court regarding appeals from landlord-tenant cases were unconstitutional and remanded the nine consolidated cases for proceedings, holding that the rights of the landlord to his property outweighed the rights of a tenant to a jury trial, and that therefore the rules of court did not violate a tenant's rights to jury trial, due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee department entered into a consent decree whereby it was required to permit prisoners to wear civilian clothing when housed in the general population.

On review, the court found that the bulletins were business-type decisions, which were not amenable to the normal public participation process, and not subject to the Documents Law. Further, the court found that appellants had not stated a cause of action under the Due Process Clause because the issuance of the bulletins was not an adjudication. Finally, the court concluded that the bulletins did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Accordingly, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant killed his victim by burning her, beating her with an iron, and drowning her, pursuing her through her apartment as he continued to attack her.

The jury found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances and returned a sentence of death. The court affirmed. This evidence was sufficient to sustain his convictions, including that for possession of an instrument of crime because the murder weapon was a clothes iron which had been specially adapted under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 907(d). The court also rejected appellant's allegations that the trial court erred in the guilt and penalty phases of his trial, including his challenges regarding the admission of crime scene pictures and other testimony, the jury charge, and the effectiveness of his counsel. The court also upheld the instruction regarding the aggravating circumstance at the penalty phase of appellant's trial, holding that although the trial court did not use the preferred instruction, the instruction given was adequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's death sentence, finding that the evidence amply demonstrated that he committed the murder with the requisite intent and deliberation to sustain his first degree murder conviction. Appellant had beaten, scalded, and drowned his victim. The court also rejected appellant's allegations of trial court error, as well as his challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), in which the trial court denied appellant's second petition for postconviction relief on the grounds that the petition was premature due to ongoing habeas corpus litigation in federal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a federal habeas corpus petition was pending, appellant filed a second petition for postconviction relief from his first degree murder convictions that was also captioned as a request for habeas relief. The trial court dismissed the petition as premature due to the ongoing federal litigation. The court affirmed on other grounds, holding that appellant's petition was untimely and the allegations did not fall within the statutory exceptions to the time limitation under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA). In rejecting appellant's assertion that habeas corpus relief was constitutionally guaranteed and could not be suspended by the PCRA, the court explained the writ continued to exist only where there was no remedy under the PCRA. Appellant's claims of constitutional violations and of law that undermined the truth-determining process were cognizable under the PCRA. Pennsylvania' s statutory writ of habeas corpus, therefore, was not available. Further, the PCRA's time limitation did not unconstitutionally limit appellant's right to habeas corpus relief because it struck a reasonable balance between the need for finality and the need to demonstrate error in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Appellant stabbed his victim repeatedly and set him on fire. The court rejected appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because appellant's counsel chose not to present evidence of appellant's alleged mental infirmity at the punishment phase since three of appellant's own experts reported that appellant was a sociopath. The court held that the prosecutor's comment that the jury should show appellant the same mercy appellant showed his victim was permissible during the penalty phase. The court found that other comments by the prosecutor did not have the unavoidable effect of arousing the jury's emotions or prejudice the jury so they could not fairly weigh the evidence. The court found that the word &quot;torture&quot; in the trial court's instruction on aggravating circumstances was not vague because the meaning of the word was common knowledge. The court determined that it was proper for the trial court to have allowed the prosecutor to read to the jury, during the penalty phase, the testimony of a rape victim of appellant. The court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed the verdicts and sentences of death imposed upon Bradley Martin and Carolyn King by the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendants consolidated direct appeals from death sentences imposed by judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Lebanon County (Pennsylvania), after the jury found that all of the aggravating circumstances presented with respect to each defendant had been established, found no mitigating circumstances for either defendant, and found each defendant guilty of first-degree murder and related offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of co-defendants' convictions and death sentences for first degree murder and related offenses, multiple challenges were overruled when the court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court found the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions of first-degree murder of a victim who had been bound, and suffocated during an attempted robbery. Though both defendants attempted to exculpate themselves by directing blame to other defendant, such finger pointing alone was insufficient to warrant separate trials. The trial court properly admitted evidence of an escape from prison that was part of the chain or sequence of events that resulted in the murder. Also, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted photographic evidence that depicted the manner in which the victim was bound, because it was essential to the intent element of first-degree murder. Finally, the proven aggravated circumstances found by the jury supported the sentence notwithstanding the court's error in the aggravated circumstance of torture under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(8) that could not be considered because it was presented through expert testimony, improperly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed verdicts and death sentences imposed upon co-defendants for first-degree murder and related offenses as supported by the evidence. The trial court's error during the penalty phase when it allowed expert testimony on torture, although circumstances of the killing provided sufficient evidence for the jury to have inferred an intent to torture the victim, was not fatal. Other proven aggravated circumstances supported the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that the trial court did not err in admitting photographic evidence, or character evidence. The court further stated that there was no reversible error by the trial court limiting appellant's counsel inquiry into the friend's drug history.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania) denying his motion for postconviction relief under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. The inmate's first appointed postconviction counsel filed an amended petition under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq., raising 72 claims of error. Thereafter, new counsel was appointed to represent the inmate, and this counsel waived all but three of the postconviction issues raised by previous counsel. On appeal of the denial of the petition, the inmate urged the reviewing court to reach all of the issues raised in the appeal, regardless of waiver, pursuant to the relaxed waiver doctrine. Citing the need for finality in capital cases and the ability to obtain postconviction review of errors by claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, the reviewing court found that relaxed waiver no longer applied to PCRA appeals. The inmate argued that the appropriate remedy was a remand to the PCRA court for appointment of substitute counsel to brief the issues waived in that court. The reviewing court found that such relief was inappropriate since the inmate was not denied the right to appeal. None of the inmate's claims of ineffective assistance were successful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nightclub operator challenged an order of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which reversed a lower court's injunction against the enforcement of Erie, Pa., Ordinance 75-1994 (1994), striking down in its entirety the ordinance that was enacted by appellees, mayor and city council members. Appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal with the highest state court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, mayor and city council members, enacted Erie, Pa., Ordinance 75-1994 (1994), which provided that it was a summary offense to appear in a state of nudity. In order to avoid being in a state of nudity, a female person over the age of 10 years of age had to wear, at a minimum, pasties and a G-string. Appellant nightclub operator, which had an establishment that featured nude female erotic dancing, filed a complaint against appellees, requesting a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional and seeking injunctive relief and attorney fees. The trial court determined that ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. A permanent injunction was granted, and the ordinance was struck down. However, appellant's request for attorney fees was denied. On cross-appeals, the trial court's order striking the ordinance and awarding appellant injunctive relief was reversed. Appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal with the highest state court. The appellate court's order was reversed, because the ordinance placed an unconstitutional burden on appellant's freedom of expression based on appellees' failure to pass strict scrutiny test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's order was reversed because appellees' nudity ordinance was unconstitutional unless the public nudity bar was severed since the negative secondary effects associated with appellant's nude dance club were inextricably linked to erotic message of the dance, thus, appellees' content-neutral reason for ordinance was insufficient to save full ordinance because it was linked with a content-based motivation for restriction.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing two jurors due to unexplained tardiness and due to a scheduling conflict. The court additionally did not err when it refused to sever defendant's trial from that of his alleged co-conspirators because separate trials of co-defendants should be granted only where the defenses of each are antagonistic to the point where such individual differences are irreconcilable and a joint trial would result in prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens sought equitable relief against appellee Commonwealth and alleged that the procedures of Pa. Const. art. III were violated when the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Act, 35 P.S. &sect; 7130.101-7130.905 (1993), was enacted. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellee based upon the doctrine of laches. On review, appellants claimed that laches could not be used to defeat a constitutional challenge to a statute. Appellants also argued that if laches did apply, appellee did not establish the requisite elements of the doctrine. The court disagreed, and held that a challenge to a statute based upon procedural deficiencies in its enactment could be barred by laches. The court reasoned that the processes that were available to the public when a new law was enacted prevented statutes that were constitutionally sound and relied upon by citizens from being continually revisited by courts. The court also concluded that appellants did not act diligently in pursuing their claim and that appellee established prejudice as a result of the eight-year delay between the statute's enactment and appellants' suit. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed defendant's petition. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that the cruel and unusual punishment clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. VIII did not prohibit the death penalty; that the definitive standards of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, set forth in the Pennsylvania death penalty statute, guided juror discretion to ensure that verdicts were not arbitrary or capricious; and that defendant had no evidence that the death penalty was disproportionately applied to the poor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a habeas corpus proceeding, defendant's death sentence arising from a murder conviction was reversed and remanded for resentencing. Upon a resentencing proceeding, defendant was again sentenced to death and appealed the judgment of the trial court. Addressing defendant's multiple contentions of error, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(h)(4), a new sentencing hearing had to be conducted where a sentence of death was vacated, except where it was vacated for lack of evidence of aggravating factors, and that a remand for imposition of a life sentence did not follow the reversal. The court held that the record supported the aggravating circumstances found by the jury and that there was no basis to find that the death sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor. Finding evidence relating to character as being at the core of the sentencing decision, the court held that the commonwealth's comments at the sentencing hearing did not invite retaliatory sentencing, but invited the jury to consider all the relevant facts including defendant's unmerciful character.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver was cited for speeding in West Virginia and notified that if he failed to appear or pay the fine, action would be taken to suspend his driver's license.

Appellee's license was then indefinitely suspended by appellant pursuant to the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6146(1), but this suspension was overturned on appeal because the lower court found that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Appellant sought review. The court held that while the lower court was incorrect as to the statute's constitutionality, the vacating of the suspension had been proper because under the Sullivan rule the suspension had been imposed prior to the effective date of the Driver License Compact of 1961. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers owned a large amount of stock issued by foreign corporations, and sued respondents, a state, its attorney general, and a county board of commissioners, in the appellate court under Pa.

The appellate court declined jurisdiction, and petitioners sought the court's plenary jurisdiction over the matter under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 726. The court held that because &sect; 4281 imposed a personal property tax on the stock of foreign corporations that did no business in or have a taxable nexus with Pennsylvania, and because foreign corporations included all corporations that were not incorporated in Pennsylvania, &sect; 4821 facially discriminated against interstate commerce. However, if the &sect; 4821 tax was substantially similar to, and the amount of the tax did not exceed, an identifiable intrastate tax, then &sect; 4821 was a compensatory tax and valid under the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. 8, cl. 3.

On appeal, the court reversed the order of the commonwealth court, holding that the tax was invalid because it distinguished between lessees of public and nonpublic property without a reasonable and just basis for the difference in treatment. Therefore, the tax violated the Uniformity Clause, Pa. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1.

On appeal, defendant argued that his confession was not admissible as to both crimes, that he was entitled to a mercy instruction, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction of first-degree murder. The court affirmed and held that the circumstantial evidence introduced by the commonwealth supported the conclusion that the child was murdered. Further, under the closely related crime exception to the corpus delicti rule, defendant's confession was admissible as to both crimes because the relationship between the two crimes was close and the policy underlying the corpus delicti rule was not violated. The court also found that defendant was not entitled to a mercy instruction and that the jury was properly instructed that if the aggravating circumstances did not outweigh the mitigating circumstances, it was required to impose a life sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing sought review of a judgment of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order of the trial court sustaining appellee driver's statutory appeal of a one-year license suspension imposed pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1532(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver, a resident and licensed driver of Pennsylvania, was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in Nebraska, which was a party to the Driver License Compact of 1961 (Compact). Nebraska reported appellee's conviction to appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, which informed appellee that his license was being suspended for one year pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1532(b)(3), based on his DUI conviction. The notice made no reference to the Compact. The trial court sustained appellee's challenge, and the appellate court concluded that the state had not enacted the Compact into law as required by Driver License Compact of 1961, art. VIII, &sect; 1; thus, appellant lacked the authority to suspend appellee's license based on his conviction in Nebraska. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court because appellant suspended appellee's license more than a year before the legislature enacted the Compact into law pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581. Consequently, appellant lacked the authority to suspend appellee's license based on his out-of-state DUI conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate court was affirmed because at the time of appellee driver's license suspension, appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing did not have the authority to suspend a driver's license based on an out-of-state conviction pursuant to the applicable statute. At the relevant time, the state had not enacted the statute into law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of first degree murder for killing his mother and sentenced to death. He was also convicted of arson and aggravated assault. The court affirmed the convictions and judgments of sentence on direct appeal and thereafter affirmed the trial court's dismissal of appellant's first post conviction relief act (PCRA) petition. Appellant then filed a motion to stay execution. The motion was denied as well as the appeal on the denial with the court concluding that the evidence in the record supported the finding that appellant was competent to be executed. A governor's warrant for the execution was issued. Appellant then filed a second petition for PCRA and an application for extraordinary relief to stay the warrant of execution. The stay was granted pending the trial court's determination as to whether appellant suffered from a mental illness which would prevent him from comprehending the reasons for the death penalty. The trial court found appellant competent and again denied his request for PCRA relief. Upon review, the court held that the claims asserted had been previously litigated on direct appeal and affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that denied appellant's petition for post conviction relief because the claims had previously been litigated on direct appeal and were therefore not appropriate for post conviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, contingent beneficiaries of a life insurance policy, sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, the primary beneficiary, enforced the life insurance contract without its modification by 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6111.2, and entered judgment awarding the proceeds of the policy to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent's life insurance policy named his ex-wife, appellee, as primary beneficiary and his children from previous marriages, appellants, as contingent beneficiaries. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and awarded her the proceeds. The trial court declined to apply 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6111.2 and enforced the contract without modification by the statute because it found that retroactive application of &sect; 6111.2 would violate the contract clauses, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court affirmed, holding that although the contracts clauses protected contracts from subsequent legislative impairment, they did not prohibit a state from exercising its police power, even if it altered contracts. The court found that because &sect; 6111.2 severely impaired the insurance contract by eliminating the decedent's designation, the statute required careful scrutiny. The court then applied a five-factor test and found that &sect; 6111.2, as applied to this case, would be unconstitutional, in violation of the contract clause. The court also held that that the remedy was to refuse to apply the statute retroactively to avoid the constitutional conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of the life insurance proceeds to appellee, primary beneficiary, and against appellants, contingent beneficiaries, because the retroactive application of the statute unconstitutionally violated the contracts clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions because it severely impaired the beneficiary designation in the contract and was not necessary to safeguard any vital interest of the people.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the privacy interests of the student were limited and gave the student no greater protection under the Pennsylvania Constitution than under the United States Constitution. The court held that the search of the student's locker under both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions required only reasonable suspicion and given all the circumstances present at the inception of the search, it was reasonable because it was minimally intrusive and affected a limited privacy interest of the student. The search was compatible with the Pennsylvania Constitution because it was carried out based upon neutral, clearly articulated guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of, inter alia, first degree murder, criminal conspiracy, and robbery, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2502(a), 903, and 3701, and imposed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of, inter alia, first degree murder, criminal conspiracy, and robbery, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2502(a), 903, and 3701, and from the imposition of the death sentence. The court affirmed. Defendant's smashing the victim's head with a hammer supported a finding of specific intent to kill, and circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant and co-defendant killed the victim in the course of a robbery. Defendant waived his claim that the trial court failed to suppress evidence as he withdrew his pre-trial motion to suppress under Pa. R. Crim. P. 323. Regardless, his arrest and the search were legal as the dwelling owner consented to the search. The Commonwealth did not violate the disclosure requirements of Pa. R. Crim. P. 305(B)(1)(b), as it did not possess the crossed-out portion of defendant's confession, even though such was in police custody. The automatic proportionality review of mitigating and aggravating circumstances in death penalty cases under Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(h) was properly conducted, as the data upon which the court relied afforded defendant protection from arbitrariness and anomalies.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the death sentence after conducting the statutory proportionality review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which upheld a municipal court's determination that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4117(b)(1), was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine by infringing on the sole authority of the judiciary to regulate the conduct of members of the legal profession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower courts agreed with defendant attorneys that the statute they were charged with violating, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4117(b)(1), was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. On appeal, the state argued that the doctrine was not offended by a statute that criminalizes conduct of an attorney for compensating a non-lawyer for client referrals because the legislature has the power to classify crimes. The court pointed out that Rule 7.2(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct prohibited an attorney from giving anything of value to a person for recommending the attorney's services, except for payments of advertising or charges imposed by referral services or legal service organizations, and that &sect; 4117(b)(1) was essentially a restatement of Rule 7.2(c). The court found that the effect of &sect; 4117(b)(1) was to criminalize the conduct of attorneys and noted that the law did not establish a duty imposed uniformly upon citizens to forego payments to individuals for business or client referrals. The court held that the statute specifically acted to regulate attorneys, which infringed on the judiciary's sole authority to regulate attorney conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower courts' judgment that the statute that defendants were accused of violating was unconstitutional. The court noted that prohibiting attorneys from paying for referrals was part of the exclusive authority granted by the state constitution to the judiciary to supervise the conduct of attorneys. The court held, therefore, that the challenged statute was unconstitutional because it infringed upon that authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial of respondent police officers for involuntary manslaughter, a witness commented on their privilege under U.S. Const. amend. V, and the trial court declared a mistrial. The trial court ordered that double jeopardy did not bar reprosecution, that selective prosecution did bar retrial, that venue or venire could not be relitigated, and that the district attorney was to be removed from prosecution and replaced by the attorney general. On appeal, the court affirmed the order on the issue of double jeopardy, holding that none of the examples of prosecutorial misconduct, individually or in combination, established a prosecutorial intent to deprive respondents of a fair trial to the extent that would bar retrial. The court held that the trial court erred in its decision that selective prosecution was a bar to reprosecution since there was no evidence of impermissible reasons to select respondents for prosecution. Since the question of venire was not one determinative of the law of the case, it could be relitigated in the trial court in which the complaint was originally filed. The trial court erred in removing the district attorney from prosecution sua sponte.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order holding that double jeopardy did not bar reprosecution despite prosecutorial misconduct but reversed those portions holding that retrial was barred due to selective prosecution, that venire could not be relitigated, and that removed the district attorney from prosecution and substituted the attorney general. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of first degree murder, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. Following a penalty proceeding, the jury sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed the trial court's order denying his second petition for post conviction relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-9551. On appeal, the court reversed the order and remanded for a new sentence hearing, holding that remarks during the prosecutor's closing argument to the jury at defendant's penalty hearing constituted reversible error. The court held that generally comments by a prosecutor do not constitute reversible error unless the unavoidable effect of such comments would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant so that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict. The court further held that, in this case, the prosecutor's remarks exceeded his authority because they implied that defendant should get the death penalty because otherwise he would be joining the ranks of defendants who have been wrongly released from jail by liberal judges.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a motion for adjudication of paternity. The lower court denied her motion, holding that she had not presented clear and convincing evidence that her husband had no access to her during the period of conception. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded, finding that the presumption of the husband's paternity had no application to the case because the purpose of the presumption, to protect the institution of marriage, could not be fulfilled. At the time of appellant's complaint for support, there was no marriage. Appellant and her husband separated before the birth of the child and were divorced at the time of the complaint.

Appellee notified appellant that he was in violation of provisions of the local code that required non-residents to pay tax on profits earned from doing business in the city. The code also required persons that did business in the city to obtain a business privilege license. Appellant did not obtain a license or pay taxes. Upon receipt of notice from appellee, appellant filed a declaratory judgment action, alleging that the local code provisions were unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint because appellant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court found that the city code provided a process for appeal of determinations of tax liability. The court held that because appellee only sent a notice, there had been no determination of tax due. Appellant had not exhausted his administrative remedies. The court held that the local code provisions did not infringe on the court's ability to regulate the practice of law because the provisions imposed interest, fines, and criminal penalties but did not prevent appellant from practicing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence of death in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), for his convictions of first degree murder, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2502(a); robbery, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3701; theft of movable property, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3921(a); possession of an instrument of crime, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 907; and criminal conspiracy to commit murder, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 903.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his death sentence. On appeal, the court held that there was ample evidence to sustain defendant's conviction. Defendant's statements to the police were admissible because he voluntarily waived his Miranda rights and because his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. IV had not attached to this charge. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the requested voir dire question because another question was used to elicit the same information. The commonwealth's exclusion of a prospective juror was not violative of the law because there were proper reasons for excluding that juror. The trial court did not err in allowing defendant's statement that he had killed another man for the limited purpose of establishing the identity of the murderer in this case. A witness's testimony that defendant told him he killed someone was not vague and thus, was admissible. The exclusion of testimony about another murder was not error because defendant had not established a logical connection between that murder and his alleged crimes. The trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial. The sentence imposed was based upon the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence in the trial court because the evidence was sufficient to support his convictions. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in determining the admissibility of evidence, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct, and the sentence was based on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered appellant to produce the documents, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed. Appellant challenged the order, contending that production of the documents violated the clergy-communicant privilege and its U.S. Const. amend. I right to the free exercise of religion. The court affirmed, holding that application of the clergy-communicant privilege was not based solely on the clergy's status, but whether the communication was made in confidence in the context of a penitential or spiritual matter. Since the information requested only regarded the manner in which the appellant conducted its affairs, the court held that the clergy-communicant privilege did not apply. The court further held that the appellant's U.S. Const. amend. I rights were not violated because the production of the documents furthered a compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means available and did not impermissibly intrude upon appellant's exercise of its religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that clergy-communicant privilege did not apply to documents kept in the course of appellant catholic church's business.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order from the Superior Court (Pennsylvania) that affirmed his in absentia conviction for driving under a suspended license under 75 Pa.

Appellant claimed that his failure to submit a self addressed stamped envelope with his motion for a continuance as required by the local rules did not relieve the clerk of court from its duty to notify him of his trial date under Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, acting pro se, filed a motion to continue his trial on a charge of driving under a suspended license in violation of 75 Pa.

Therefore, the clerk of courts did not send appellant a copy of the order resetting the trial date, appellant did not appear at trial, the trial court convicted appellant as charged in absentia, and the appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, the court held that because the determination of appellant's guilt occurred after the effective date of revised Pa. R. Crim. P. 9025, which imposed a mandatory duty on the clerk of courts to send copies of the trial court's orders to all parties or attorneys, and because the local rules could not void a mandatory duty, appellant was entitled to receive a copy of the court's order setting his trial date regardless of whether or not he submitted an SASE pursuant to the local rules.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's in absentia conviction for driving under a suspended license and remanded the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state liquor board fined appellee liquor licensee for advertising the prices of its liquor drinks in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 4-498. However, the trial court ruled that &sect; 4-498 violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court reversed the order, finding that &sect; 4-498 was a valid exercise of the commonwealth's right to regulate liquor under U.S. Const. amend. XXI. The U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration after the U.S. Supreme Court decided a similar case from another state. The court held that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that U.S. Const. amend. XXI did not qualify the prohibition against laws abridging free speed in U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. I set the minimum levels applicable to Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and that the court was bound to follow the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to its interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, because the U.S. Supreme court invalidated a similar statute from another state as an impermissible infringement on free speech, &sect; 4-498 violated the U.S. and Pennsylvania constitutions. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an applicable case, which stated that a defendant's right to privacy in his home was to remain inviolate under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, was to be applied retroactively.

The court of judicial discipline dismissed the charges. Appellant, judicial conduct board, sought review of the decision and that of two discovery orders. The cause arose following an investigation that lead to the discovery of marijuana at appellee's residence, and allegations of improprieties with a young girl. Prior to trial, appellee requested and received the identity of the complainant and the minutes of the meeting effectuating the investigation. Upon review, the court held that disclosure of the complainant was moot, but held that a waiver of confidentially by a judicial officer did not automatically entitle him to receive all the confidential information acquired by the board in the course of its investigation. The court of judicial discipline erred in releasing the information to appellee. Further, the court held that the marijuana discovery was a factual finding and was not subject to review by the court. Lastly, the facts revealed appellee did nothing improper with the girl. The court affirmed the court of judicial discipline and dismissed the charges.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's original death sentence was vacated and remanded due to improper prosecutorial argument during the penalty phase. A second jury imposed the death penalty, and defendant sought review. The court held that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9711(h)(2) and (4), as amended in 1988, applied to all cases or appeals pending on the effective date and that when reviewing a death sentence, the court should affirm the sentence or vacate and remand for further proceedings. The court held that the prosecutorial misconduct had not descended to a level which violated all principles of justice and fairness of double jeopardy. The court held that the trial court had broad discretion in phrasing jury instructions so long as the law was clearly and accurately presented to the jury. The court held that a change of venue was not necessary because there had been a sufficient cooling-off period between the publicity and the trial. Because defendant's witness' statements were contradictory and harmful, it was proper to allow defendant's counsel to cross-examine defendant's own witness. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing challenged the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which ruled that appellant's regulation that revoked the operating privilege upon the occurrence of a single epileptic episode was violative of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver suffered a grand mal epileptic seizure. His physician submitted a convulsive disorder form to appellant bureau in accordance with 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1518(b). Appellant recalled appellee's operating privileges on the basis that his seizure rendered him incompetent to drive for one year pursuant to 67 Pa. Code &sect; 83.4. Both the trial court and the commonwealth court ruled that the regulation at issue was violative of due process. Relying on a line of cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, the court affirmed the commonwealth court. The court held that the regulation created an irrebuttable presumption that a person who had suffered one seizure was incompetent to drive for a period of one-year following the occurrence of the seizure. The court held that the essential elements of due process were notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Though the regulation provided an opportunity for a de novo hearing on whether the operator suffered a seizure, it did not allow an opportunity to rebut the presumption of incompetence to drive. Thus, the de novo hearing was not a meaningful hearing and the regulation violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected this contention concluding that the statements were spontaneous and wholly unsolicited by the police. Appellant also asserted that he was compelled to go to trial while he was under the influence of certain medication and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue at trial. The court held that appellant's contention lacked merit because appellant was twice evaluated and twice found competent to stand trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed an interlocutory appeal of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) for a competency examination, on the ground that the amended 50 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7403(a) was unconstitutional. Petitioner argued that because the trial court expressed a doubt as to his competence by ordering a competency examination sua sponte, it was inappropriate to retain the presumption that he was competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged and held without bail for murder. The trial court sua sponte ordered a competency examination, and designated two psychiatrists to conduct the examination. Thereafter, petitioner filed an emergency appeal requesting a stay of his competency examination. Petitioner argued that because the trial court expressed a doubt as to his competence by ordering a competency examination sua sponte, it was inappropriate to retain the presumption that he was competent to stand trial. The appeals court remanded the case for further proceedings. The court ruled that the amended statute,&nbsp;50 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7403(a), only required a criminal defendant to demonstrate his incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence. The court noted that this new standard of proof was in accordance with federal and state supreme court cases that hold that requiring a criminal defendant to prove his incompetence to stand trial by a preponderance of the evidence did not violate due process. Thus, the court ruled that regardless of whether the trial court or petitioner raises the question of incompetency by requesting a competency examination, petitioner shouldered the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that under state and federal constitutional law, a state may presume that the defendant is competent and require him to shoulder the burden of proving his incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each appellant was cited for driving a motor vehicle on the public roads of Pennsylvania while their driver's licenses were suspended, and each license was suspended for a non-driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances (DUI) related offense, which subjected them to the sentencing enhancement provisions of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(b) when they were later arrested for DUI. Appellants surrendered their licenses pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1540(a). The court held that because the licenses were suspended in accordance with &sect; 1543(b), the periods of suspension became effective immediately upon receipt of the certified conviction under &sect; 1540(a). The application of &sect; 1543(b) resulting in a suspension from the date of the DUI conviction until the date on which driving privileges were restored withstood equal-protection scrutiny. The court affirmed the convictions because once a driver was notified that his license was suspended under 75 Pa. 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731, he was subject to the enhanced sentencing provisions of &sect; 1543(b) for the duration of any prior periods of suspension or revocation until the completion of the DUI-related suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed judgment against all three appellants because once a driver was notified that his license was suspended as a result of a conviction for driving under the influence, he was subject to the enhanced sentencing provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which dismissed the count of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of the driving under the influence statute&nbsp;&sect; 3731(a)(5), holding that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with one count of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(1) (incapable of safe driving); one count of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(5); and a summary offense for failing to stop at a stop sign. Appellee filed omnibus pretrial motions and the trial court issued an opinion and order that granted appellee's pretrial motion that dismissed the second count, holding that &sect; 3731(a)(5) was unconstitutional, and the Commonwealth appealed. The court held that without having required any proof that the person actually exceeded the legal limit of .10 percent at the time of driving, the statute swept unnecessarily broadly into activity which had not been declared unlawful and the statute completely failed to require any proof that the accused's blood alcohol level had exceeded the legal limit at the time of driving. The court affirmed the order of the trial court, holding that because &sect; 3731(a)(5) had clearly, palpably, and plainly violated both the constitutions of the United States and of this Commonwealth, it was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court because the statute unnecessarily encompassed both lawful and unlawful conduct; failed to provide a reasonable standard by which a person could gauge their conduct; encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement; and failed to require proof that a person's blood alcohol content actually exceeded the legal limit at the time of driving, and therefore the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The equity court granted injunctive relief and immediately issued a second order repeating the first order, but directed appellant and the board to engage in court-monitored bargaining. The intermediate appellate court reversed, concluding that Act 88, 43 P.S. &sect; 11-1101-A et seq., removed public school employees from the scope of Public Employees Relation Act (PERA), 43 P.S. &sect; 1101.1003, therefore the equity court could not order court-monitored bargaining. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that Act 88 was to be construed in pari materia with PERA as though the two sections were part of one statute. The court held that a court sitting in equity that had issued an injunction restraining a work stoppage and an order requiring rescheduling of school days also had authority to order a school board and a teachers association to enter into court-monitored negotiations.</SPAN></P>

Nine years later, petitioner county commissioners sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent to establish a state scheme of funding. The court granted the petition. The court held that the dispute was a matter of immediate public importance, and thus assumed jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 726. The court held that mandamus was appropriate because petitioners sought to compel the official performance of a ministerial act, or mandatory duty, and had no other remedy at law. The court held that the speech or debate clause, Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, did not insulate respondent from suit where respondent had been directed to remedy a constitutional defect in the scheme that funded the court system. The court held that the crucial function of the separation of powers principle was not separation per se, but the &quot;checking&quot; power each branch had over the others.</SPAN></P>

JUDGES BELOW: Hon. Samuel W. Salus, II.  <BR>Commonwealth v. Fisher, 527 Pa. 345, 591 A.2d 710, 1991 Pa. LEXIS 117 (1991)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which entered his jury conviction for capital murder and imposed a sentence of death, by virtue of the automatic direct appeal from a judgment of sentence of death. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 722(4), 9711(h)(1); Pa. R. App. P. 702(b), 1941. Appellant alleged the trial court erred in admitting victim impact evidence during the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder for the shooting death of his girlfriend. The jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and sentenced appellant to death, after which he challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant. The victim's death was witnessed by appellant's friend, who testified at appellant's trial approximately eight years after the murder. The delay in trial was the result of appellant's fleeing to another state. Further, other witnesses supplied relevant circumstantial evidence. Therefore, the court affirmed appellant's conviction. However, the court vacated appellant's sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing, finding that the trial court erred in admitting victim impact evidence, in the form of the testimony of the victim's mother. Further, the trial court gave the jurors confusing instructions in telling them that the evidence could be considered &quot;mentally&quot; without considering it an aggravating circumstance. This error interjected an arbitrary factor into the sentencing decision of the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of murder in the first degree, but vacated the judgment of sentence of death and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The court found all of appellant's arguments regarding the guilt phase of his trial meritless, but agreed that the capital sentencing scheme in effect at the time of his trial precluded the admission of victim impact testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder of the first degree, robbery, and conspiracy, and sentenced to death. He challenged both on appeal. The court found that defendant's defective affidavit issue was moot as there was a prima facie case finding at the preliminary hearing. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to establish an independent basis for in-court eyewitness identifications and thus they were properly admitted. A statement made by defendant was found to be an unsolicited and gratuitous utterance, and thus was not subject to suppression. Evidence found in a briefcase was also properly admitted, as it was properly searched under a search warrant. Because the trial court found that eyewitness identification expert testimony was not necessary for defense purposes, it properly denied its payment. Even though the state did not give timely notice of aggravating circumstances at defendant's arraignment as required by Pa. R. Crim. P. 352, the related evidence did not need to be excluded as defendant was on constructive notice of such circumstances. The court found that the jury charge and death sentence were proper. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that eyewitness testimony was properly admitted as it had an independent basis, and an unsolicited and gratuitous utterance by defendant was not subject to suppression. As defendant had constructive knowledge of aggravating circumstances, the fact that the state served the same to him late was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon his conviction and death sentence for first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime, defendant filed many appeals. He filed a relief petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546 (1988), which the lower court denied. Defendant challenged the ruling and argued that he was entitled to relief under the PCRA because his allegations had not been previously litigated, and while they were waived, it was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and thus the anti-waiver provision, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9543(a)(3)(iii) (1988), applied. The court held that defendant failed to prove any ineffectiveness. The attorney did not commit error in following defendant's directive to not present mitigation evidence, nor in failing to raise a meritless objection. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to state's closing argument, as it was not improper and was based on legitimate inferences. As defendant failed to establish pervasive pretrial publicity, counsel properly did not seek a change of venue. As defendant did not prove ineffectiveness, he was not eligible for PCRA relief, and the court affirmed the lower court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant gas commission permitted appellant utility's rate increase for fiscal year 1991-92. Appellee public advocate represented residential customers in gas rate proceedings, and challenged the decision before the trial court. That court affirmed the gas commission's decision that the utility's $ 18,000,000 payment to the City of Philadelphia did not violate the Pennsylvania Constitution or Pennsylvania law. The trial court held that the payment represented a reasonable return on the city's equity in the utility. Appellee contended the payment was an unconstitutional tax. The commonwealth court reversed, and held that the payment was not proportionate to the ratepayers' use of the gas works, the annual payment constituted a tax which was imposed without the city properly exercising its taxing powers, and thus, was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The court reversed. The overall rate approved by the gas commission for the gas works' 1991-92 fiscal year was constitutional since it was just and reasonable and since the fixed annual payment was rationally related to the city's asserted equity in the gas works.</SPAN></P>

Appellees then filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claiming that the city's demolition of their building deprived them of a right, privilege and immunity secured by U.S. Const. amends.

The trial court denied the motion and damages were awarded in appellees' favor. On appeal, this court concluded that the &sect; 1983 action was barred under the theory of res judicata because both actions by appellees involved compensation for the same property and the same exercise of power by the city.

Appellee initiated an action for injunctive relief against appellant that sought to enjoin appellant from entering into such contract. Without holding an evidentiary hearing on such issue, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction. Appellant contended that a hearing was necessary. On appeal, the court dissolved the temporary injunction and remanded for an evidentiary hearing. Without a hearing, appellant was unable to introduce evidence and explain the reasons for the proposed contract. Appellant was also unable to argue that the Code did allow for subcontracting of teachers. Appellant contended that if the Code did not allow for such subcontracting, then it conflicted with Pa.

Two of the children began attending college, so appellee filed a petition to terminate his support obligation as to those two children.

Appellant public welfare department intervened contending that such statute did not violate equal protection principles. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Section 4327(a) violated equal protection principles because it treated the children of divorced parents and married parents unequally. Under the statute, divorced parents were obligated to pay the educational costs of their children after the children reached age 18. Married parents had no such obligation. There was no legitimate state reason for treating children of divorced parents differently than children of married parents.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the jury was adequately instructed as to the mitigating circumstance presented by appellant, and the proper method of weighing that circumstance in its deliberations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the superior court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court which found him in civil contempt and sentenced him for criminal contempt after he was granted immunity for testimony in the murder trial of an alleged co-conspirator but refused to testify. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction after reviewing the text and history of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5947, caselaw from other states, and policy considerations. The court held that the privilege against self-incrimination under art. I, &sect; 9 was more expansive than that under U.S. Const. amend. V; it was not, however, so expansive that it would require transactional immunity rather than the use and derivative use immunity provided in &sect; 5947. The court held that in the prosecution of a defendant subsequent to his immunized testimony, the evidence offered by the commonwealth would have to be reviewed with the most careful scrutiny, that is, the commonwealth would have to prove, of record, by the heightened standard of clear and convincing evidence, that the evidence upon which the subsequent prosecution was brought arose wholly from independent sources.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, by direct appeal, challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him to death, 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that under its duty to review the sufficiency of the evidence in capital cases, the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, amply supported the convictions. Evidence of the rape and attempted murder of another victim was admissible to demonstrate a common scheme to establish identity and malice. The evidence of one victim's pregnancy was relevant to a physical characteristic in the common scheme and was necessary to identify the victim. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a bench trial or appellant's resulting motion for recusal. Appellant's statements were voluntarily and knowingly made. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to present a diminished capacity defense based on appellant's irrelevant impulsiveness, failing to present an unsupportable voluntary intoxication defense, or failing to object to the prosecutor's permissible sentencing arguments for deterrence and retribution. Sufficient evidence supported the aggravating circumstances found by the jury. The sentences of death were not illegal, excessive, or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under 42 Pa. Cons.

On direct appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The governor signed an execution warrant. The court ordered a stay of execution until further order.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-9551, defendant filed a petition alleging prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, denial of due process, and inability to present evidence of defendant's psychiatric history. The court denied relief and vacated the stay of execution. Defendant appealed. The reviewing court found no ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant presented no evidence that he could avail himself of the insanity defense. The court also found that state-paid psychiatric assistance in the sentencing phase was not required because the prosecution had not asserted defendant's future dangerousness to society. Also, the prosecutor's remarks at the guilt phase were not outside permissible boundaries of oratorical flair. Defendant was not entitled to a claim of self-defense because defendant was the aggressor by breaking into an establishment. The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued the verdict was erroneous because he acted under a sudden and intense passion that made it impossible for him to act with the necessary intent required to establish first-degree murder. The reviewing court found that after defendant threatened to kill his ex-girlfriend, defendant drove to her residence and waited in his car for an extended period of time. Defendant then broke into the house and shot two individuals. The evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant acted with malice aforethought and with a specific intent to kill. Even if defendant acted under the heat of passion, a sufficient amount of time for cooling had elapsed between defendant made the threatening call and the actual murder. The court also found that defendant was not acting in self-defense because defendant went uninvited and armed to the house in the middle of the night and broke through the front door.

The court found that the lower courts had not applied the same scope of review as to the arbitration awards. One lower court had used the narrow certiorari scope of review. On the other hand, the essence test, used by two of the lower courts, permitted a court to vacate an arbitrator's award if the court found that the award did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. The court held that the essence test under the Uniform Arbitration Act, Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7301-7320, should not have been applied merely because the cases included police and fire personnel. The court held that 42 Pa. Stat. 217.1-217.10 governed the cases and, thus, the essence test should not have been employed in the review. Accordingly, the court reversed the orders of the lower courts that relied on the essence test and reinstated the arbitrators' awards. The court affirmed the lower court's order in the other case, holding that the narrow certiorari scope of review was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant magazine publishers brought an action against appellees, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Department of Internal Revenue, that sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Appellants challenged the constitutionality of 72 P.S. &sect; 7204(30), an amendment to the tax code that deleted the sales and use tax exemption for magazines. The trial court denied appellants relief. Appellants contended that the amendment violated their rights to freedom of speech under U.S. Const. amend. I and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, freedom of the press, equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend XIV, &sect; 1 and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 26, and uniformity of taxation under Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court affirmed the trial court's order and held that the trial court applied the &sect; 7204(30) in a content-neutral manner. The court also held that there was no abridgment of appellants' rights under art. I, &sect; 7 because publications were exempt from generally applicable sales tax on the basis of format and frequency and not content. The court concluded that the sales tax, as applied to magazines, did not violate appellants' federal or state constitutional rights to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession and delivery of marijuana. He sought to suppress the tape recording of a transaction between himself and the confidential informant, which occurred in defendant's home. The district attorney authorized the interception, but no judicial approval was obtained. The appellate court vacated the trial court's order granting defendant a new trial. The court reversed the appellate court's order and remanded for a new trial, holding that one can reasonably expect that his right to privacy will not be violated in his home through the use of any electronic surveillance. There was no evidence to suggest that defendant did not have an expectation of privacy within his home. Because there was no determination of probable cause by a neutral judicial authority, the consensual body wire violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the tape recording of the transaction in defendant's home should have been suppressed. The court declined to consider whether the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of two counts of first degree murder under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2502, two counts of arson endangering persons under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3301(a), and one count of arson endangering property under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3301(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of murder and arson after he was seen running from a house in which two women were found bound, gagged, and burnt to death. Defendant sustained serious burns. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erroneously failed to suppress statements he gave to the police because they were involuntary due to his condition when they were made. The court affirmed, finding that the statement was voluntary because the factual findings were supported by the doctor's testimony that defendant was alert, cooperative, and unimpaired by pain drugs when interviewed by the police. Defendant's claim of error based on the trial court's failure to suppress crime scene evidence seized without a warrant lacked merit because the trial court properly applied the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. There was no error in refusing mistrial, where the trial court properly exercised its discretion to allow the commonwealth to ask a hypothetical question, defendant suffered no prejudice from the prosecutor remarks, and the jury charge on voluntary manslaughter was proper where the trial court clearly told the jury that its opinion was not binding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence for aggravated murders and arson because the sentence was not excessive and there was ample evidence of his guilt and aggravating circumstances. The trial court properly refused to suppress defendant's statements where the doctor testified he was alert and unimpaired when he spoke to police, and properly denied a mistrial where defendant was not prejudiced by the challenged actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee township's zoning officer denied appellant gas well owner's application for a variance to operate a gas well under appellee's zoning ordinance which permitted, in residential &quot;A&quot; districts, the use of municipal and public utility facilities to produce gas, but prohibited operation of gas wells by private entities. Appellant appealed to the township's zoning hearing board, the court of common pleas, and the appellate court, without obtaining relief. On review, appellant challenged the distinction between public and private operations, alleging that such a distinction was arbitrary and unreasonable and, hence, an invalid exercise of the township's police powers. The court reversed, holding the justifications advanced by appellee to support its prohibition of private operation were not supported by the record, the distinction between private and public operation was arbitrary, the means were not reasonably related to the ends sought to be attained, and the restrictions were patently beyond the necessities of the case because there was not a scintilla of evidence that a municipality or public utility could produce gas any more safely than a private operator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment upholding appellee township's zoning ordinance, holding that the ordinance was an invalid exercise of the police power because it was unreasonable, oppressive, and its prohibition of private gas production did not bear a real and substantial relation to the health, safety, and welfare of the community. The case was remanded for entry of judgment in favor of appellant gas well owner.</SPAN></P>

Where an officer had probable cause to request a blood test pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, bureau of liquor control enforcement, sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), that found Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 498, which prohibited appellee licensee from advertising the price of any malt beverage, cordial, wine, or distilled liquor offered for sale, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, bureau of liquor control enforcement, was responsible for enforcing the Pennsylvania Liquor Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 1-101 et seq. Appellant issued a citation against appellee licensee charging a violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 498, which prohibited appellee from advertising in any manner whatsoever the price of any malt beverage, cordial, wine, or distilled liquor offered for sale in the state. The trial court found that &sect; 498 violated the Pennsylvania Constitution because it violated the constitutional right to commercial speech. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 498 was reasonably related to legitimate legislative goals in the area of alcohol control and the incidental curtailment of the right of commercial speech was justified where acquisition of a liquor license was a privilege, not a right. Therefore, &sect; 498 was a valid exercise of Pennsylvania's right to regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, which found that the relevant statute, which prohibited liquor advertising by appellee licensee, was unconstitutional, holding that the statute was reasonably related to legitimate alcohol control legislative goals and the curtailment of commercial speech was justified where the acquisition of a liquor license from appellant, bureau of liquor control enforcement, was a privilege, not a right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his death sentence from the Court of Common Pleas, Trial Division, Criminal Section of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) as of right pursuant to statute allowing for automatic review of death sentences. Defendant was convicted of murder of the first degree, robbery, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime enhanced by aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 722(4), defendant sought relief from a death sentence imposed for the convictions of murder of the first degree, robbery, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. Defendant claimed that the court erred in a jury instruction at the penalty phase of the trial as to aggravating circumstances. The court affirmed the trial court's death sentence. The court held that the charge had been read in its entirety to the jury and that the trial court had repeatedly instructed the jury that it was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that an aggravating circumstance had been proven. The trial court was merely reminding the jury of what it had done in the guilt phase of the trial, finding that defendant had killed the victim in the perpetration of a felony of robbery. The instruction was that the jury could find defendant guilty of robbery only if it found that he had caused serious bodily injury in the course of committing a theft. Since the jury convicted defendant of robbery, it must have found that he committed the shooting while perpetrating the theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's convictions and death sentence of defendant because the jury instruction on aggravating circumstances was properly given and the jury had found beyond a reasonable doubt that an aggravated circumstance existed to allow for a death sentence as opposed to a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury for the crimes of murder in the first degree, robbery, and possession of an instrument of crime, and was sentenced to death. Appellant claimed several errors on appeal, including the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel for counsel's inactions at trial, the fact that he was shackled during trial, and the presentation of mitigating circumstances at sentencing. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that both were supported by substantial evidence and that counsel was not ineffective because appellant's proposed objection was meritless. Further, shackling was necessary and permitted under exceptional circumstances, and the evidence showed that the jury had considered all sentencing evidence, however the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating ones. Finally, the court found no abuse of the discretion of the trial court for denying a motion for a new trial, because the jury's verdict did not shock the conscience nor demand another opportunity for justice to prevail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought automatic review of judgments of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of two murders, possession of an instrument of crime, and abuse of a corpse, and imposed sentences of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the murder of two victims and sentenced to death for the murder of each victim. Defendant contended that his trial counsel was ineffective, that the death penalty statute,&nbsp;42 Pa. Cons.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions but reversed his sentences. The court held that the trial court's instruction, that the jury was required to consider the lack of unanimity regarding findings of mitigating circumstances when determining whether the mitigating circumstances were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances, interfered with the province of the jury. Therefore, the court held that defendant was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to object and that a new hearing as to penalty was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured challenged the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the trial court's order that it lacked jurisdiction over a claim against appellee insurer for denial of coverage after an adverse peer review under the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1701 et seq., because appellant failed to request reconsideration of the peer review under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1797(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case presented a question of first impression under the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL), 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1701 et seq. The MVFRL was amended by the Act of February 7, 1990, P.L. 11 (Act 6), which established a peer review plan for evaluating treatment and health care services provided to a person injured in an automobile accident. Appellant insured filed a claim for medical expenses resulting from an auto accident under her policy with appellee insurer. After an adverse peer review, appellee denied the claim. The trial court held and the appellate court affirmed that as 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1797(b) provided for a request for reconsideration of an initial peer review decision, appellant insured had not exhausted a mandatory administrative remedy. The court held peer review organizations under &sect; 1797(b) were not administrative agencies nor should they be afforded deference as they are not neutral. The court reversed the decision below and remanded for further proceedings as it held &sect; 1797(b) was not an alternative dispute resolution procedure and that there was no exhaustion requirement before judicial resolution of a policy dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's order and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The court held the statutory provision for reconsideration of adverse peer reviews of insurance claims based on medical treatment for injuries was not a mandatory administrative remedy that required exhaustion before a claimant could seek judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee one was convicted of possession, possession with intent to deliver marijuana, and conspiracy.

He was also sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months for the criminal conspiracy conviction. Appellee two and three were convicted of possession of 116 pounds of marijuana with intent to deliver. The court reversed the orders of the lower courts and remanded the matters for sentencing in accordance with the court's opinion because the court found that although the legislature did not expressly provide a maximum sentence in 18 Pa. Cons. &sect; 7508(1)(a)(ii) or (iii), one could be reasonably implied when that section is read together with 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(f)(2).

The facts of the case were so egregious that the court was able to conclude that there was no error in trial counsel's failure to request a definition of the term &quot;torture&quot; for the jury because the young victim was tortured to death. The evidence showed that the victim's final hours were marked by unspeakable horrors, inflicted to satiate appellant's sadistic appetite.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of murder in the first degree, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2502, and related crimes, and the trial court sentenced her to death. On appeal, appellant asserted error by the trial court in admitting a photograph of the decedent alive. The court found that the existence of the decedent as a life in being was clearly established through the testimony of various witnesses. The photograph was introduced for the purpose of engendering sympathy for the decedent with the intent of creating an atmosphere of prejudice against appellant. The admission of this photograph was error. However, the testimony surrounding the photograph was limited, thus in light of the overwhelming circumstantial evidence of appellant's guilt, the court concluded that the error was harmless. Appellant further objected to a photograph of herself in a newspaper article relating the interest of the police in speaking with her regarding the death. The court held that the introduction of the article containing the photograph was relevant to the commonwealth's position that appellant was eluding the police, thus creating an inference of guilt. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and death sentence on the grounds that although admission of the photograph of the decedent was improper and irrelevant, the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming circumstantial evidence of appellant's guilt. Introduction of the newspaper article containing appellant's photograph was relevant to the commonwealth's position that appellant was eluding the police.</SPAN></P>

The sentence of death imposed for the death of the child was vacated and the matter was remanded to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing. The jury fixed appellant's penalty at death. Post-trial motions were considered and denied, and appellant was sentenced to death by the trial court. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence of the trial court. Photographs of the crime scene were not inflammatory, and could not have prejudiced appellant, and thus were properly admitted. An officer's testimony was not inflammatory and could not have prejudiced appellant. There was nothing in the record to support appellant's claim that the trial court inserted its personal opinions into the jury's deliberations or essentially told the jury to sentence appellant to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees brought a citizens lawsuit under certain environmental statutes against appellant for allegedly polluting the environment with hazardous waste.

The court held that DER was an indispensable party defendant because justice could not be done in its absence. The concern was phrased as a balancing of the interests between appellees, appellant, the absent third-party, and the efficient administration of justice. Moreover, DER satisfied the relevant criteria for joinder as an indispensable party. Finally, the court placed the jurisdiction of the case in the commonwealth court for the sake of the public interest, and to avoid a multiplicity of lawsuits emanating from different counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city adopted a fiscal recovery plan after it was designated as financially distressed under the Financially Distressed Municipalities Act (act), 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 11701.101-11701.501. Appellant police officers brought an action claiming the plan violated provisions of its collective bargaining agreement and several sections of the act were unconstitutional. The trial court sustained several preliminary objections raised by appellee and dismissed the constitutional claims. The court held that sovereign immunity barred appellant's claims against the commonwealth, did not bar appellant's constitutional claims against appellee, but barred damages on its contract claim. The court found the act did not unconstitutionally delegate fiscal authority because appellee's governing body retained the decision-making authority under the plan. The court held that the act was rationally related to a proper commonwealth purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee licensee pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, appellee's driver's permit was suspended by appellant commonwealth pursuant to 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(m). The lower court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it failed to accomplish a legitimate state objective. The court found that the statute was to be evaluated under a rational basis analysis because a driver's license was a privilege and not a fundamental right. The court held that the statute promoted the legitimate interest of protecting against the proliferation of drug use. The court also held that it could identify potential benefits to appellant's citizens from the statute because the loss of a driver's license could deter a potential drug user from committing the offense, since the criminal penalty for the offense might only be minor. The court reversed the judgment of trial court because both prongs of the rational basis test were met.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patient underwent sterilization immediately after the birth of her son. Appellee sued appellant hospital to recover damages based on the alleged negligence of appellant in not informing her prior to the sterilization procedure that the child had Downs syndrome and in failing to test for the presence of the disorder within sufficient time for her to elect to terminate the pregnancy. The trial court struck the wrongful birth claims, holding those claims were precluded under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 8305, which by its own terms had retroactive effect to any case pending or under appeal. The appellate court reversed the order, holding the retroactive application of the statute unconstitutional, and remanded the case. The court held that the order was properly appealable because the complaint stated two separate and distinct causes of action and the trial court rendered final judgment on one of those. The court held that the retroactivity provision could not constitutionally be applied to appellee because her vested right in the cause of action accrued several years prior to the enactment of the statute. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that evidence concerning the manner in which the victim died established that defendant possessed the specific intent to kill the victim. Reviewing the record, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts. The court then held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence, as defendant voluntarily confessed and was not detained illegally. The court noted defendant had been free to leave the state troopers' barracks at any time prior to his confession.

The court found that defendant's unsupported claims of ineffective counsel possessed no arguable merit, that he was not prejudiced by alleged errors, and that he failed to provide a reasonable basis to support remand for an evidentiary hearing. The court concluded that &sect; 9711 was not unconstitutional, that it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, and that it did not create a special tribunal to consider the death penalty. The court stated that the jury's imposition of the death sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice, or arbitrarily imposed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), convicting him of murder in the first degree, and sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, and he was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to use a peremptory challenge to exclude a prospective juror who was the same race as defendant, that the testimony of witnesses establishing that defendant had a significant history of felony convictions was so irrelevant, inflammatory and prejudicial that it deprived him of a fair trial, and that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to admit a packet of letters written by defendant into evidence. The court ruled that defendant did not establish any facts and circumstances which raised an inference of purposeful discrimination. Further, the court held that a trial court did not err when it refused to limit evidence of defendant's prior convictions to a certified record and sanitized summary of the circumstances of the prior crimes. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that the trial court did not err in excluding the letters because to allow the letters into evidence would have been tantamount to granting defendant the right of allocution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant because photographs of a crime scene were admissible if they were relevant, could assist the jury in understanding the facts of the case, and did not unduly inflame the passions of the jury. The state was afforded reasonable latitude in arguing its position to the jury and could employ oratorical flare in arguing for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The next month, appellees, students and parents, filed an action against appellee district, appellant union, and the commonwealth, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that PERA was unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed teachers to strike. The trial court initially dismissed the action. On appeal, the commonwealth court held the commonwealth was not an indispensable party to the action for declaratory relief. Accordingly, the case was remanded. On remand, the trial court held PERA was unconstitutional insofar as it granted public school teachers the right to strike. Consequently, appellants sought review. On review, the court reversed because appellees, students and parents, failed to prove that the provisions of PERA, which allowed a strike, were clearly, palpably, and plainly unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The independent regulatory review commission (IRRC) disapproved appellee department of environmental resource's amended regulations, under the Regulatory Review Act, 71 P.S. &sect; 745.1-745-15. The regulations were considered under the predecessor statute's provisions. Appellee tried to get the regulations published but was told that the senate's disapproval of the governor's request for approval of the regulations barred publication. The lower court granted appellee summary judgment and ordered the regulations published. Appellants, the commonwealth officials and bodies, sought review of the decision. The court vacated the decision, holding that because the new act provided a new procedure for regulations, which in the governor's opinion addressed &quot;conditions which may threaten the public health, safety, or welfare,&quot; the permanent bar to publication could not apply to the regulations if they were authorized under the new act. The court held that the appropriate course of action was for appellee to resubmit the regulations to the IRCC under the new Act. The court held that because that was not done, the relief requested was speculative of how the new act would operate.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1547(a)(2), were unreasonable searches in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee drunk drivers' criminal convictions from the trial courts were reversed by the appellate court because the provision of the implied consent law that had provided for collection of blood or urine samples when an officer had reason to believe that the individual was involved in an accident with a fatality or needed medical treatment (Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1547(a)(2)), was unconstitutional. Appellant commonwealth sought review, and the court affirmed and held that the purpose underlying the implied consent statute was to enable the police to obtain evidence of intoxication or drug use to be utilized in criminal proceedings. No matter how compelling the commonwealth's interest in securing evidence that a driver was operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs it had not evinced a special need that would justify departure from the probable cause requirements of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Appellee's challenge under Pa. Const. art I, &sect; 8 was affirmed as well because the provision had impermissibly dispensed with the probable cause requirement and was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

XIV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and art. III, &sect;&sect; 14 and 32. The trial court denied the petition of appellants for intervention. The court quashed the appeal because the order was not appealable where appellants had another way to secure the relief sought through intervention. The court opined that the main interest of appellants was represented by the other parties to the action, Pa. R. Civ. P. 2329(2), and the outcome of the suit did not affect appellants' ability to raise the issue of disproportionate taxation in a separate action. Further, if the issue of disproportionate taxation was raised at some time later in this suit, appellants were not precluded from petitioning to intervene at that time. Finally, to the extent that appellants' views were too important to be ignored, they had the remedy of petitioning to be heard as amicus curiae.</SPAN></P>

The parties' negotiations for an agreement were initiated, but were unsuccessful. The court affirmed and stated that unless the rules of law relied upon were palpably wrong or clearly inapplicable, a grant of injunctive relief would not be reversed on appeal. The court concluded that reasonable grounds existed for such equitable relief. The Port Authority Act, 55 P.S. &sect; 563.2, made arbitration discretionary with the parties. In the absence of a legislative directive, the soundest approach was to treat port authority employees consistently with public employees governed by the Public Employee Relations Act, 43 P.S. &sect; 1101.101 et seq. As for appellant's argument that it was unfair to deprive its members of the right to strike without submitting the dispute to binding arbitration, appellant was not without a remedy; such remedy was with the courts of the Commonwealth, as was other public employees.</SPAN></P>

The issue was the constitutionality of systematic, non-discriminatory, non-arbitrary roadblocks for the purpose of insuring safety on the highways by disclosing registration, licensing and equipment violations. The court found that the balancing of interests approach was the appropriate method for determining reasonableness under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court noted that 27 violations were detected in the roadblock, which evidenced the advancement of the legitimate interests it was designed to serve. The court found that the public interest was not met by less intrusive means because stops based on a probable cause or reasonable suspicion standard were incapable of detecting status offenses as opposed to observable offenses. The public interest was the mass carnage that resulted from unlicensed drivers and unsafe vehicles occupying the road. Therefore, defendant's apprehension and the statute that authorized it, 75 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two accomplices were tried together and defendant was convicted of murder and associated crimes and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and argued that identifications and his statement should have been suppressed, that the trial court rulings restricted the trial, that his counsel was ineffective, that his juvenile record was improperly admitted and the death penalty was unconstitutional.

The court also ruled that the several evidentiary rulings of the trial court were proper and not restrictive, that the prosecutor's closing argument was not inflammatory, and that defendant's counsel was not ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania), where he was found guilty of two counts of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. Appellant asserted numerous issues starting from the trial court's denial of his motion to quash the information lodged against him to issues revolving the imposition of the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in a robbery which ended with the violent killing of two victims. Appellant was implicated by an informant and, later, by a fellow inmate. Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. Appellant sought review and asserted a multiple errors on the part of the trial court prior to, during, and subsequent to his finding of guilt. On review, the court found that the trial court's denial of a motion to quash the information was proper due to the applicable criminal rule. There was sufficient evidence to support the convictions. Reliance by the police upon the informant's information had sufficient indicia of reliability under constitutional standards. A review of the publicity in the case revealed that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for change of venue. Further, a curative instruction was sufficient to eradicate any prejudice resulting from a remark that appellant's admission was done while in jail. The court found no other reversible constitutional, evidentiary, substantive, or procedural issue. Finally, the court determined that that the death penalty was appropriate. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's first degree murder convictions and sentence of death were affirmed because the court found no error regarding the application of the criminal rules, informant information, jailhouse admission, publicity and change of venue, or any other constitutional, evidentiary, substantive, or procedural issue. The court also found that the death penalty was appropriate under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Defendant initially agreed to submit to a blood test but at the hospital he changed his mind and refused to consent to a blood test.

Defendant was convicted of DUI and driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded the statutory limit. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and granted defendant a new trial. The court held that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(a) permitted blood alcohol testing unless the subject gave an affirmative showing of his refusal to consent to the test at the time the test was administered. The court held that defendant was permitted to retract his initial consent. The court held that the results of the blood alcohol test should have been suppressed and that, because of the likely effect of the test on the DUI conviction and the statutory requirement of the other charge, the court vacated the judgment of sentence on both counts and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review and asserted several pre-trial, trial, and sentencing errors. On appeal, the court found that a motion to sever appellant's trial from that of his codefendants was properly denied. As to the trial, the court determined that juror &quot;pranks&quot; and horseplay did not mean that the involved or other jurors were incompetent to render a fair and impartial determination of his guilt or innocence. Appellant's assertion that he had no specific intent to kill was dismissed due to the doctrine of transferred intent. The court also rejected the contention that prosecutor comments or case presentation denied appellant a fair trial after a review of the record. Nor did the court agree that appellant's trial counsel was ineffective. The court also rejected appellant's issues pertaining to the constitutionality of the death penalty statute and his sentence. The judgment was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant district attorney sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas, Chester County (Pennsylvania) that granted appellee councilman's motion for judgment on the pleadings and determining that appellee could simultaneously hold office as both a councilman and a constable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellee councilman was elected to office, he already held the elected position of constable. After refusing to relinquish the office of constable, appellant district attorney filed a quo warranto action challenging appellee's authority to hold the office of councilman. Appellant sought review after the lower court found that appellee could hold both positions pursuant to 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 410, 412. The court found that &sect; 410 permitted a constable to be an officer in a political party, hold the office of county or state or national committee member in a political party, run for and hold elective office, and participate in any election day activities. Relying on the statutory construction rule that a general expression used in a statute was limited to things similar to items specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expression, the court concluded that &quot;run for and hold elective office&quot; in &sect; 410 meant elective offices in political parties. The court found that 65 P.S. &sect; 14, 53 P.S. &sect; 36001, and Coatesville, Pa., Home Rule Charter &sect; 203 specifically prohibited a council member from holding any other elected public office.

The statute relied upon by the lower court only allowed an elected official to simultaneously hold an elected office in a political party, and other statutes expressly prohibited appellee from simultaneously holding office.</SPAN></P>

Each case was affirmed on appeal by the commonwealth court. Appellants challenged the judgments, and the cases were consolidated. The court reversed the denial of appellants' benefits, holding that neither the history nor the language of the state constitution supported the conclusion that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(b) was meant to create broad pension forfeiture. Mere removal from the bench did automatically result in the loss of retirement benefits. The court held that the Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act of 1978, 43 P.S. &sect; 1311 et seq., established a specific method for the forfeiture of pensions by public officials, where certain crimes had been committed. The statute was applicable to judges and appellee could not deny benefits unless the appellants' misconduct was enumerated explicitly therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizens challenged the 1991 Final Plan devised by respondent Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission and adopted on November 15, 1991.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizens challenged a reapportionment plan written by respondent commission, which altered the legislative and voting districts within the state. The court approved the plan, noting that it was restricted in its review to determining whether the plan was in conformance with the state and federal constitutions and the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1971, et seq. The court denied petitioners' request to declare an effective date of the plan after the November 1992 election. Pa. Const. art. II &sect; 17 clearly established the effective date of a reapportionment plan. The court held that there was no requirement that districts be redrawn in such a manner that incumbent senators remained residents of their redrawn districts. Legislators, whose offices were eliminated by the plan, did not have a constitutionally protected interest in their political seats, which were not the private domain of the officeholder. Any vacancies occurring as a result of the plan were to be filled by a special election. The court found that petitioners' allegations of gerrymandering were without merit and that the plan was consistent with the intent of the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the final plan of respondent commission complied with all constitutional and statutory requirements and that it was to be used for elections to the General Assembly until the next reapportionment was constitutionally required. The court noted that legislators did not have a private nor constitutionally protected interest in their offices. The court held that there was no evidence of gerrymandering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of two counts of murder in the first degree and numerous related offenses. He was sentenced to death on both counts of murder. The court affirmed the conviction. Appellant was not prejudiced by the introduction of his codefendant's confession in the joint trial. The trial court properly instructed the jury as to the use of the confession by the co-defendant. The trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for mistrial following testimony by a witness for the state because the jury was given a curative instruction and because the remark was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Photographs of the victims and their child were admissible to demonstrate malice, an essential element of murder of the first and third degrees, and to show the history and natural development of the facts. The court held that the evidence supported two aggravating circumstances found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but found that the absence of any instruction on the aggravating circumstance pertaining to torture was prejudicially deficient. The court sustained the convictions but vacated the sentences of death and remanded for a new sentence hearing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that the issue was the constitutionality of the ordinance, i.e., whether the ordinance was a proper exercise of the police power, and not whether appellant deserved to be able to make a particular use of his property. The court held that the purpose of a severability provision in the zoning ordinance was to salvage the ordinance if any part of it was declared invalid. The ordinance could be saved from unconstitutionality by severance of the setback provision. It was then economically and geographically feasible to locate a quarry in the industrial district. The only limitation on appellant's use derived from state regulations. Because the ordinance in that form was not exclusionary, there was no basis for ordering the site-specific relief sought by appellant. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state senators brought issue regarding the redistricting of Pennsylvania's seats in the United States House of Representatives. Appellants filed an action against appellee state election officials regarding the existing congressional apportionment law and sought to declare the existing congressional apportionment law unconstitutional, to enjoin the implementation of the official congressional election schedule until a valid plan could be adopted, and to adopt a valid reapportionment plan if the Legislature was unable to do so. After the parties were unable to come to an understanding, appellants applied and were granted plenary jurisdiction to the high court. On review, the court noted that federal law required, primarily, that districts be equal in population to the greatest practical extent. The court examined constitutional principles and precedent and ultimately approved one of appellees' plans. The approved plan had a low maximum deviation, was consistent with minimal splitting of precincts, achieved an enlarged number of congressional districts with a majority African-American population, and came closest to implementing community-of-interest factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant telephone company challenged the order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which reversed the order of the state's public utility commission and ruled that a Caller ID service could not be offered in Pennsylvania, except for use by emergency service providers. The court found the service violated the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 P. S. &sect;&sect; 5701-5781. Petitions for allowance of appeal were filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant telephone company proposed to offer Caller ID. The trial court found, and the court agreed, that such service violated the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 P. S. &sect;&sect; 5701-5781, and could not be offered. The Caller ID terminal attached to the subscriber's telephone line and captured the incoming impulses which identified the originating number. Caller ID, therefore, fell within the general prohibition of 18 P. S. &sect; 5771(a) and could not have been used by anyone without first obtaining a court order. At issue was whether it fell within one of the exceptions to the general prohibition. It was argued that Caller ID was allowed under the exception which permitted the use of a trap and trace device by a provider of electronic or wire communication service with the consent of the user of the service. However, the Caller ID subscriber was not an electronic or communicating service provider. The exception was only applicable to appellant, not to the subscriber. The consent provision must had to be read in light of the overall requirement of the controlling law and consent was required from all parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision to prohibit Caller ID service was affirmed, where the court found that it fell within a general prohibition of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, and no exception applied. The court did not need to reach the constitutional issues, because the case could properly be decided on non-constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) following a jury verdict finding appellant guilty of murder in the first-degree, and a sentencing proceeding pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711, resulting in a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant joined forces with two others to rob a bar. Appellant killed two patrons during the robbery. He alleged that the others had previously committed a string of robberies together. One of the others entered into a plea agreement with the commonwealth. Appellant and a co-defendant were tried together. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a severance of trials. The court held that appellant and his co-defendant were appropriately tried together because they were charged with the same crimes and with the same evidence, both of which stemmed from the same criminal transaction. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in defining preponderance of the evidence for the jury in the sentencing stage by stating that it was less of a margin than beyond a reasonable doubt, and that such error resulted in jury confusion and prejudice. The court held that he failed to offer specific argument as to how the jury was confused by the definition on any common-sense basis, and that in spite of his failure to offer evidence of any mitigating circumstances, the jury did find that he had no significant history of prior convictions. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's judgment of sentence of the death penalty was affirmed because there was no error in trying appellant with his codefendant. Appellant's claimed error by the trial court in limiting testimony amounted to mere fingerpointing at his codefendant, which was not admissible. Appellant failed to establish that the jury was in any way confused about the definition of preponderance of the evidence in the sentencing stage of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed from the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania) modifying the judgment of sentence of the common pleas court. The question on appeal was whether the double jeopardy clause was violated when, after sentencing the appellee to a term of incarceration, the sentencing court recalled appellee and resentenced him for the same criminal offense to a different term of incarceration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the trial court. After sentencing appellee to a term of incarceration, the sentencing court recalled appellee and resentenced him for the same criminal offense to a different term of incarceration. Review was sought. The reviewing court left appellee with a reduced sentence even though the sentencing judge admitted error because it found double jeopardy applied to the receipt of sentences. The commonwealth sought further review. The primary question on appeal was whether the double jeopardy clause was violated when appellee was resentenced for the same criminal offense multiple times. The court noted the double jeopardy clause preserved the finality of judgments and prevented the state from making repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense. However, it also afforded criminal defendants an expectation of finality in their sentencing. The court also adopted principles from United States Supreme Court precedents that showed sentencing changes and resentencings were allowable and not violative of double jeopardy rights. The court reversed the lower court order and reinstated the trial court's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court order and reinstated the trial court sentence appellee initially received for his conviction for voluntary manslaughter. The court stated the lower court's modification of appellee's sentence was based upon a decision that had been overruled. The court also concluded that though defendants had a right to finality in sentencing, it did not mean resentencing violated double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his closing statement of the penalty stage of appellant's trial, the prosecutors argued that the Bible said, &quot;the murderer shall be put to death.&quot; The court noted that in the past courts have narrowly tolerated references to the Bible and have characterized such references as on the limits of &quot;oratorical flair&quot; and have cautioned that such references are a dangerous practice to be strongly discouraged. The court found that the argument advocated to the jury that an independent source of law existed for the conclusion that the death penalty was the appropriate punishment for appellant and that because the courts were not ecclesiastical courts there was no reason to refer to religious rules or commandments to support the imposition of a death penalty. Because the prosecutor's argument in favor of the death penalty reached outside of the evidence of the case and the law of the commonwealth, the court held that the death penalty may have been the product of passion, prejudice, or an arbitrary factor and vacated the sentence of death and remanded the matter for a new sentencing hearing under 42 Pa.

The court granted allocatur limited to the question of what notice was required to be given to the payor of a support obligation prior to entry of judgment on arrears under 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4352. In this case, appellee was not notified as to a change in his support obligation. The court agreed with the lower courts that to permit a judgment by operation of law with regard to alleged arrearages existing as of the modified child support law without notice and a reasonable opportunity to act would be an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law. By promulgating the notice provisions of &sect;4352(g), the court concluded the legislature evinced its concern and intent to give notice to existing obligors under current orders prior to the implementation of the new provisions regarding modification of arrearages.</SPAN></P>

The court also noted the trial court retained jurisdiction over the matter and stated that the injunction might have been dissolved upon a showing by the appellant city that enforcement of the injunction would be more harmful than beneficial. Appellant made no such showing. The court affirmed the preliminary injunction stating that its existence did not harm the public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, automobile dealerships and a trade association, filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment and refunds of taxes paid, asserting that a mercantile license tax was unconstitutional for failure to meet the uniformity requirement of Pa. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1. When the tax was repealed, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee city on the claim for declaratory relief on grounds of mootness and on the claim for refunds. When the decision was affirmed on appeal, appellants were granted allocatur by the supreme court. The court found that the lower courts failed to undertake a proper analysis of the question whether a decision regarding the constitutionality of the tax statute would be applied retroactively and relied instead on a conclusory assertion that requiring refunds would impose a substantial hardship on appellee as the basis for denying retroactive application. The court held that appellants were not given an opportunity to present their evidence regarding the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed the summary judgment on the claim for declaratory relief but reversed the summary judgment on the claims for refunds and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his sentence of death imposed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) following his conviction of murder in the first-degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant murdered a police officer who was a member of a drug enforcement squad in the officer's home. Appellant was convicted and received the death penalty. Among his many claims of error, appellant claimed that his speedy trial rights were violated under Pa. R. Crim. P. 1100 because he was not brought to trial until 695 days after his arrest. The court held that the evidence established that the commonwealth was prepared to proceed at all times and that appellant caused virtually all of the trial delay through numerous continuances, unavailability of counsel, and changes in counsel. The court found that the trial delay actually caused by the trial court was minimal, and the commonwealth was clearly diligent in its efforts to bring appellant to trial. The court also noted that appellant did not request dismissal based upon an alleged speedy trial violation until nearly a year after the original run date. Under these facts, the court found that appellant suffered no prejudice. The court affirmed, holding held that the evidence supported the jury's finding of the aggravating circumstance and that the sentence was proportionate in comparison to sentences imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's death sentence was affirmed because the evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant murdered his victim while perpetrating a robbery and a burglary, and supported the jury's finding of the aggravating circumstance. Appellant's speedy trial rights were not infringed because he was responsible for 19 of the 22 months of delay between his arrest and his trial, and the commonwealth was ready to proceed at all times.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among appellant's multiple claims of error in his capital murder trial were his claims that the trial court erred in refusing to let him introduce expert psychiatric testimony during the guilt phase of the trial. The court affirmed, holding that testimony from psychiatric experts was relevant only if it could establish that the defendant was insane under the &quot;M'Naghten&quot; standard, or to negate specific intent to commit first-degree murder. Both experts' reports indicated that appellant was probably psychotic and may have been delusional at the time of the murders, but that he knew the nature and quality of his acts and he understood that what he was doing was wrong. The reports also indicated that appellant had the ability to form specific intent at the time of the murder, so there was no indication that he would have a diminished capacity to from the specific intent to murder. Thus, the court held that the testimony was not relevant and was properly excluded. The court also held that testimony tending to show that appellant was &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; could only be properly admitted at the penalty phase, not the guilt phase, and was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions and judgment of sentence of death were affirmed because appellant's claims of insanity and diminished capacity were negated by appellant's experts' reports, which established that he could form specific intent and that he knew what he was doing was wrong. Evidence that appellant was &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; was not admissible in the penalty stage of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Condemnees filed preliminary objections to a declaration of taking filed by the urban redevelopment authority. The trial court overruled the objections, and the commonwealth court affirmed. Condemnees contended that they had been unconstitutionally denied a hearing to challenge the certification of blight, and that the taking was invalid for failure of the certification of blight process to comply with the requirements of the local agency law. The court affirmed. The planning commission was not required to notify property owners and hold hearings before determining that an area was appropriate for redevelopment under the Urban Redevelopment Law, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1701 et seq. The decision of the commission to designate an area for redevelopment was one that did not itself affect property rights. It was an internal decision made by a government body presumed to perform its duties in good faith and according to law. The court held that planning commissions are not required to conduct their decision-making process according to an adversarial model, bearing a burden of &quot;proving&quot; that their proposed actions conform to the power delegated to them by their enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner of a building housing a theater, sought review of an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the dismissal of appellant's action challenging the authority of appellee historical commission to designate appellant's theatre as an historic building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner of a building housing an art deco-designed theater, argued that reviewing courts erred in upholding appellee historical commission's decision designating appellant's theater as historic. The court agreed, noting first that appellee, in invoking a city code provision to declare the building as historic over appellant's objection, placed the total financial responsibility for preserving the theater upon appellant. Explaining, the court cited due process problems with the process used by appellee to make its decision. Pointing to the lack of a neutral and detached arbiter, the court observed that appellee members not only argued the case in favor of historic designation, but also made the ultimate decision on whether the property would be so designated. Moreover, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 27, encouraging the preservation of historic resources for the benefit of the people, was circumvented by the city code provision that gave absolute control over the property to appellee, but imposed all preservation costs on appellant. Thus, appellant's property was taken for public use without satisfying the constitution's just compensation requirement, the court concluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order dismissing appellant theater owner's suit challenging the authority of appellee historical commission to designate appellant's art deco-designed theater as historic reversed, as the &quot;taking&quot; of the building for public use without making just compensation was constitutionally deficient when all preservation costs of the taking were imposed on appellant, while absolute control over the property was given to appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to serious fiscal and administrative problems in the courts of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the state supreme court appointed two justices to oversee the budgetary restructuring and administrative reformation of the courts.

On appellant's motion for reargument, the court consolidated several other actions wherein the question of retroactivity was also at issue. The court found that the threshold test in deciding whether a new decision might be given prospective application only was whether the decision established a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. The court found that its earlier decision did not meet that test, and held that its ruling in the earlier decision would apply to the instant appeal, the instant consolidated appeals, and to all proceedings pending at the time of its earlier, wherein the issue of the constitutionality of the Leadership Committee postponement provision in Section 4(4) of the Sunset Act was timely raised and properly preserved.</SPAN></P>

In imposing the death sentence, the jury determined that the evidence supported two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. Appellant raised several issues on review. Among them was a challenge to the trial court's jury instruction with regard to mitigating circumstances. Specifically, appellant asserted that the trial court improperly instructed that a finding of mitigating circumstances had to be unanimous. The court found that the instruction to the verdict and death sentence was proper. However, the court was troubled by the court's response to a question from the jury. The jury asked whether they all had to agree whether a circumstance was true or not true, and the judge answered in the affirmative. Based on this, the court concluded that the jury could have been misled into believing that a unanimous verdict was required in order to conclude a mitigating circumstance existed. It also found that such a perception could have tainted the weighing process and the ultimate outcome. Accordingly, the judgment of sentence was vacated and remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teachers association sought review of a lower court order, upon the request for declaratory relief by appellees, parents and students, declaring appellant's limited right to strike as violative of Pa.

In support of its ruling, the court held that a declaratory judgment may not be employed to determine rights in anticipation of events that may never occur or for consideration of moot cases or as a medium for the rendition of an advisory opinion that may prove to be purely academic. With respect to the instant case, the court found that once the lower court held that, while appellant's strike was unconstitutional, appellees had no standing to seek relief against them, it became moot whether the teachers had a theoretical right to strike under the state Constitution. Accordingly, the court noted that it was unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue, and by doing so the lower court rendered an impermissible advisory opinion.</SPAN></P>

The police discovered marijuana and arrested defendant for criminal conspiracy, simple possession, possession with intent to deliver, possession with intent to manufacture, and manufacture of a controlled substance.

Defendant sought further review, and the supreme court held that the warrant was defective because it was not based upon probable cause. The supreme court also determined that even though the police exercised good faith in obtaining the warrant, there was no good faith exception to the warrant requirement under Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Commonwealth Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed dismissal of appeal from a zoning board decision upholding the validity of an amortization provision in an ordinance affecting appellant's business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant opened an adult bookstore in appellee township. Thereafter, appellee township enacted an ordinance making appellant's bookstore a nonconforming land use in its then location; the ordinance contained an amortization provision that would have required appellant to cease its business within 90 days. The state supreme court reversed appellee zoning board's determination that the amortization provision was valid. The court held that the amortization and discontinuance of a lawful pre-existing nonconforming land use was per se confiscatory and violative of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Here, there was no evidence that appellant's bookstore violated obscenity laws or was in any other way unlawful, constituted a nuisance, or was abandoned. Thus, appellee township's ordinance was unconstitutional on its face, as it allowed an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; of appellant's property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order reversed, as amortization provision in appellee township's zoning ordinance was facially unconstitutional where it required the discontinuance of appellant's lawful pre-existing nonconforming land use without providing just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was before the court on joint application for a stay of remand to review petitioner's claims of error by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his petition for writ of habeas corpus relative to his criminal contempt sentence. The commonwealth sought review of the order finding 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5947(e) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While petitioner was imprisoned on drug-related charges, he was granted immunity under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5947(e) to testify before a grand jury. He invoked his privilege against self-incrimination and the trial court found him in civil contempt and sentenced him to prison. When the grand jury went out of existence, the trial court terminated petitioner's confinement and ruled &sect; 5947(e)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it permitted a civil contemnor's imprisonment beyond the existence of the grand jury. Petitioner filed an application for writ of habeas corpus. The trial court dismissed the petition. Acting on a joint application to stay a remand from the appellate court, the court accepted direct review. It ruled that &sect; 5947 was constitutional because petitioner always had the power to purge himself of the contempt, even after the grand jury disbanded. There was no double jeopardy violation when the contempt sentence interrupted petitioner's drug-related sentence because the trial court had inherent authority to suspend the prior sentence for the purpose of enforcing its civil contempt orders. Thus, the court affirmed the order dismissing petitioner's application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing petitioner's application for habeas corpus because the imposition of a civil contempt sentence that suspended his drug-related sentence was not a double jeopardy violation. The court concluded that the statute, which permitted a civil contemnor to be imprisoned beyond the existence of the grand jury, was constitutional because petitioner retained the power to purge himself of the contempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a death sentence imposed pursuant to Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;. 9711, for a murder conviction, based on numerous urged errors in the sentencing proceeding below. The court affirmed the death penalty in favor of appellee state, concluding the sentence was not a product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor while findings plainly supported aggravating circumstances of killing while in the perpetration of a felony. The court first rejected the argument that the refusal to grant a continuance denied appellant a fair trial. The court reasoned no abuse of discretion existed in the denial when such continuance to obtain new counsel was requested although defense counsel indicated his investigation was complete and it was an obvious ruse to delay the inevitable. The court determined it was not error to remove appellant from the courtroom when his right to be present was lost through his own intentional disruption and outbursts. The court found prosecutorial argument in favor of death penalty properly included statements about belief of appellant's guilt, quality of mitigating factors, and a reference to lack of sympathy shown the victim.</SPAN></P>

He maintained that voices instructed him to murder the victims because they were having homosexual relations.

The commonwealth's experts testified that defendant was not insane at the time of the murders. Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder, one count of attempted murder, burglary, criminal trespass, and aggravated assault. The trial court imposed the death penalty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which reversed a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board that had denied appellee employer's petition for termination of appellant's widow's benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was awarded widow's benefits based upon her husband's work-related death. Shortly thereafter, appellee employer learned that appellant was living with another man, and filed a petition to terminate compensation benefits under the Worker's Compensation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 562. The Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Board) determined that such a finding did not mandate termination of benefits. The lower court reversed the Board, holding that the language of the Act was mandatory and not discretionary and, therefore, once the Board determined that appellant was participating in a meretricious relationship, termination of benefits was required. Appellant challenged the order on appeal. The court concluded that the use of the word &quot;may&quot; granted discretion to the Board. Because the Board was granted discretion, the issue became under what guidelines the discretion could be exercised. The use of economic circumstances as a basis upon which to determine whether benefits should have been continued or terminated was not an arbitrary exercise of the Board's discretion. As such, the Board's exercise of discretion was not arbitrary, and its order was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (Pennsylvania), convicting appellant of first degree murder, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, burglary, theft, robbery, and aggravated assault. In connection with the murder conviction, appellant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant burglarized the dormitory room of a college student. The victim was present at the time of the burglary and appellant viciously assaulted her. He slashed victim's neck repeatedly with broken glass, bit her face, raped her, sodomized her, strangled her, and beat her all over her face and body. He murdered victim to prevent her from identifying him. The trial court found appellant guilty of first degree murder, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, burglary, theft, robbery, and aggravated assault. Appellant was sentenced to death. Appellant challenged the evidentiary rulings permitting or prohibiting proof of facts relating to issues of insanity and the denial of his attempts to introduce evidence related to his defense of alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication. The judgment was affirmed because appellant could not use evidence of his voluntary drinking to establish a mental infirmity regarding an insanity defense. Also, evidence suggested that appellant was fully conscious of his criminal actions because he carried out a detailed burglary plan and was able to formulate an intent to kill to prevent identification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment related to appellant's convictions for first degree murder, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, burglary, theft, robbery, aggravated assault and his death sentence for the murder conviction because appellant's defense of insanity based upon having an inherent pathologic illness triggered by the voluntary ingestion of alcohol was not recognized as a proper defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of first degree murder, criminal conspiracy, and robbery, and imposed the sentence of death after a finding of two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder, criminal conspiracy, and robbery, and was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and the sentence. The court held there was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to have determined that all elements of the crimes for which appellant was convicted were established beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no answer adduced with respect to whether appellant was a suspect in an unrelated murder, and the issue itself was raised first by appellant. Counsel was not ineffective with respect to the impact of an accomplice's deal on his credibility. The jurors were made aware of appellant's age and whether they did not consider it to be a mitigating circumstance was a decision wholly within their province. Unanimity was not required in establishing mitigating circumstances. The revelation of misdemeanor convictions paled in comparison to the impact upon the jury of the more serious felony convictions. Their revelation did not prejudice appellant's case and counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to them. The sentence of death was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was denied relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541, et seq. Appellant alleged that the PCRA's 1995 amendments were null and void because they allegedly comprised legislation which exceeded the scope of the governor's proclamation of designated subjects to be addressed during special session in violation of Pa. Const. art. 3, &sect; 12. The PCRA, which provided a vehicle for a wrongfully convicted person to collaterally challenge his criminal conviction, was certainly not outside the scope of the designated subject matter of the special session on crime, but fell squarely within the subject matter designated by the governor for consideration by the legislature. The lack of a specific request for particular legislation in a governor's call did not render unconstitutional the subsequent enactment of specific legislation where that legislation falls within the ambit of the general subject matter of the call.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the trial court erred when it ruled that the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), 23 Pa.

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Oregon's application of the provisions of the UIFSA, which permitted Oregon to exercise personal jurisdiction over him in order to establish a child support order. There was no evidence to suggest that appellant was denied the ability to seek review of Oregon's Circuit Court decision that it had personal jurisdiction over him. Appellant filed subsequent motions regarding the order and there was no evidence he preserved a personal jurisdiction challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), granting appellees' preliminary objections and dismissing appellant's wrongful termination complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sued appellees, her former employer and its successor corporation, for wrongful discharge and age discrimination. Appellant claimed she was fired for reporting suspected Medicare fraud by appellee employer, based on her review of old and discarded files. The trial court granted appellees' preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and dismissed the complaint. Appellant challenged only the dismissal of her wrongful discharge claim, and the court affirmed. Since appellant did not demonstrate that she was under a statutory duty to search the files for evidence of Medicare fraud and report the alleged fraud to federal investigators, she was not entitled to relief on public policy considerations from the at-will employment doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the complaint was affirmed. Because appellant was under no statutorily imposed duty to report suspected past Medicare fraud by appellee employer, appellees were within their rights to discharge her as an at-will employee for making such reports.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, with a blood alcohol content of 0.145 percent 71 minutes after his automobile accident, filed an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of driving under the influence in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3731(a)(1) and (a)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in an accident and arrested after failing three field sobriety tests. Seventy-one minutes after the accident, he was given a test, which revealed a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.145 percent. He was charged with DUI pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3731(a)(1) and (a)(4) and a jury found him guilty. The court affirmed conviction, rejecting appellant's argument that the trial court should not have permitted evidence of his BAC to support the charge under Section 3731(a)(4) because the commonwealth did not present expert relation-back testimony. Once the commonwealth established that appellant's BAC reflected an amount above 0.10 percent, the commonwealth made a prima facie case and it was not required to present expert testimony relating the BAC test result back to the time appellant was driving. Because appellant did not present any evidence that might have rebutted the commonwealth's prima facie case, his conviction under Section 3731(a)(4) was proper. The evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction under Section 3731(a)(1), including a trooper's observations of appellant, the results of three field sobriety tests, and appellant's BAC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that once the commonwealth established that appellant's BAC was above 0.10 percent, it made a prima facie case and was not required to present expert testimony relating the test result back to the time that appellant was driving. The evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction.</SPAN></P>
