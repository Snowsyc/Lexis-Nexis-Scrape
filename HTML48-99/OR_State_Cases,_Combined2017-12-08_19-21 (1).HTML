</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff vendors brought a declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that they owned the vendors' interest under a land sale contract. The Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), entered a judgment in favor of defendant sureties. The vendors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the vendors owned a vendors' interest in a land contract, which they assigned to a creditor as security for a guarantee on a corporate loan. Later a third party loaned the creditor and the corporation a sum, which the creditor secured by assigning his assignee's interest in the land contract. The sureties guaranteed that second loan. When the creditor and the corporation defaulted on the second loan, the creditor, the corporation, and the sureties were all sued. The sureties settled the lawsuit and obtained an assignment of the note on the second loan and of the third party's right, title, and interest in the land contract. The court concluded that the sureties were not the owners of the vendors' interest in the land contract because the third party had obtained nothing by the creditor's assignment of his interest in the land contract. The court noted that the creditor had only a security interest in the land contract and did not assign the underlying debt to the third party. However, the court was unable to determine who the true owner of the interest was as between the vendors and the creditor because the creditor was not a party to the lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the sureties and remanded the matter with instructions to dismiss unless the creditor was joined as a party within a time limit to be set by the trial court. The court said that if the creditor was joined and asserted that he owned the vendors' interest, the rights as between the creditor and the vendors had to be litigated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action against the cities to challenge the constitutionality of 1987 Or.

The trial court held that the statute was constitutional, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed because &sect; 3 provided that the annexations to which it related were effective by operation of the 1987 Act, and it also stated that its provisions applied notwithstanding any other provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 199. Thus, the legislature made it clear that 1987 Or. Laws. Ch. 818, &sect; 3 was an independent source of validity for the annexations that it covered. In addition, statutory provisions affecting city boundaries were consistent with Or. Const. Art. XI, M 2 with regard to the cities because their charters did not describe their boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the revocation of his probation by the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which had imposed conditions on defendant's probation, including a requirement that he post the notice &quot;Dangerous Sex Offender&quot; on his residence and any car he drove. An earlier appeal of the conditions themselves had been dismissed as moot when the probation was revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State first argued that the revocation of probation was not a judgment of conviction or any other appealable event under any statute granting appeals to criminal defendants. The court disagreed, noting that although Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.550(4), which authorized revocation of a probation previously granted, did not describe such an action as either an order or a judgment, it &quot;smelled, looked, and quacked&quot; like a judgment and therefore was subject to appellate review. But the court refused to review the conditions of probation to which defendant objected, holding that its scope of review was limited by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050, because defendant pleaded guilty, to whether the sentence imposed was cruel or unusual. Defendant did not challenge the length of the incarceration, contend that it exceeded the term specified for the crimes, or contend that it was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. The court concluded that it was obligated to affirm the judgment. It rejected, as contrary to the import of &sect; 138.050, defendant's argument that because revocation for violation of an unlawful condition of probation was invalid, any sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the revocation of the probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to rape in the second degree. The Circuit Court, Coos County (Oregon), suspended sentence and placed him on probation for five years, subject to conditions. On appeal, defendant claimed that a condition prohibiting him from being in a private home where children under the age of 18 were present was overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the court could only consider whether the sentence exceeded the maximum allowed by law or was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual and that, because defendant made neither of those contentions, there was nothing for the court to consider. The court found that a more fundamental issue was whether it could consider any part of the judgment or whether it could consider defendant's contention, unrestricted by the limitations imposed by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050. The court held: (1) where defendant pled guilty, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.050 controlled; (2) a judgment of probation was not a sentence, let alone one that was contended to exceed the maximum allowable by law or to be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual; and (3) where defendant pled guilty and was granted probation, he could not appeal from the judgment of conviction where the trial court suspended his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Oregon sought review of a decision of the District Court, Douglas County (Oregon), which sustained the demurrer of defendant. Defendant had been charged with the failure to perform the duties of a driver pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 811.700(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court allowed the demurrer on the ground that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 811.700(1)(c) was unconstitutionally vague. The State appealed from the judgment on the demurrer pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.660. The court disagreed with the decision of the trial court and determined that defendant's demurrer should have been overruled. The requirement under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 811.700(1)(c) that a person take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to notify the person in charge of damaged property of the fact that it had been damaged articulated what was required sufficiently. It was left to the finder of fact to determine only whether the steps taken to provide the information to the owner or person in charge met that standard. Thus, the court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 811.700(1)(c) was a constitutionally valid statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the contention that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.905 violated the privileges and immunities provisions of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. According to the court, the minor and his parents did not show unequal treatment to them as individuals or as a class. The court further rejected the contention that the negligence claim asserted by the minor and his parents was timely because it was governed by either Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.110, the two-year statute of limitation, or Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12.115, the general statute of repose, both of which ran from the date of injury.

The lower court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument. The court affirmed the conviction.

The court found the municipal code permitted resistance to an arrest made with excessive force. None of defendant's examples of how the municipal code prohibited free speech fit the definition of &quot;resist&quot; as used in the section so both of his constitutional challenges failed.</SPAN></P>

The City appealed from the pretrial judgments dismissing the complaints, and the appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that City of Portland, Or., Code &sect; 14.32.100 was in conflict with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240, which prohibited the carrying of concealed weapons, and was thereby preempted. In affirming, the court held that &sect; 166.240 only prohibited carrying certain types of concealed knives. Excluded from that list were pocketknives, regardless of the length of the blade. The statutory policy was to broadly preserve the right to bear arms, while narrowly limiting the right to carry knives. City of Portland, Or., Code &sect; 14.32.100 made it unlawful for any legally unauthorized person to carry a pocketknife with a blade longer than three and one-half inches. Thus City of Portland, Or., Code &sect; 14.32.100 prohibited an act that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240 permitted: the carrying of any concealed knife that had a blade longer than three and one-half inches. City of Portland, Or., Code &sect; 14.32.100 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240 were not compatible. Thus, City of Portland, Or., Code &sect; 14.32.100 was preempted, as a city ordinance could not prohibit an act permitted by a state statute or permit an act that was prohibited by a state statute.</SPAN></P>

The borrowers had sought a determination of their rights under their farm and home loan agreements with DVA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrowers alleged six claims. Three were based on contracts with DVA which provided for an award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in litigation. The borrowers contended that, because DVA denied that their claims arose from the contracts and then &quot;straddled&quot; the issue by conditional language in the prayer, it failed to meet the requirement that it set out the facts or statute upon which it was relying for the award. The court disagreed and affirmed the award. DVA's pleading adequately asserted the contractual basis of its right to recover attorney fees and gave the borrowers notice that it was prepared to assert a claim on that ground. The pleadings met the requirements of Or. R. Civ. P. 68C. The court held that the trial court considered the appropriate factors in determining the fee. It considered the hourly fee billed as relevant but not determinative. The evidence supported the conclusion that the hours spent in defending the action were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a judgment for the union and awarded attorney fees to the union under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The government argued that the complaint had not presented a justiciable controversy because no there were no complaints of specific activities being restricted. The court held that the complaint had little if anything to do with the potential discipline or risk of discipline. The court concluded that &sect; 181.400(2) facially violated Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, wife of decedent and insurer, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court, Douglas County (Oregon), which granted defendant State's motion to dismiss the wife's wrongful death claim on the ground that it was immune from liability under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a). The decedent's employer's workers' compensation carrier paid benefits to the wife and the insurer sought reimbursement of those benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed when the tractor he was driving overturned on a state highway. Plaintiffs argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a), which stated that every public body was immune from liability for any claim for injury to or death of any person covered by any workers' compensation law, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the State. The court stated that the opportunity to sue the State was a privilege which &sect; 30.265(3)(a) denied to persons who had recovered workers' compensation benefits. It discriminated against a true class and, therefore, was subject to constitutional scrutiny. The distinction drawn between persons receiving workers' compensation benefits and those not receiving benefits was established by workers' compensation laws and existed independently of &sect; 30.265(3)(a). That distinction was not based on immutable personal characteristics. Accordingly, plaintiffs had to show that &sect; 30.265(3)(a) was not rationally related to a legitimate state purpose, which they could not do. The court concluded that there was a rational basis for retaining governmental immunity as to those persons receiving workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>

Further, under &sect; 163.405(1)(b), defendant's conduct was deemed &quot;deviate sexual intercourse,&quot; and the plain language of the statutes demonstrated that sexual penetration was not an element of sodomy. As to the admission of polygraph evidence, defendant mistakenly relied on a case that was decided several months after he was convicted, and the case did not have a retroactive effect. Moreover, the evidence was received without objection pursuant to a stipulation of the parties; thus, the question was not preserved for appeal.

Defendant assigned error to the overruling of his demurrer to the complaint, through which he asserted that the code provision violated the speech provisions of the state and federal constitutions, Or.

Because defendant did not attempt to use certain exception procedures, he could not complain on equal protection or equal privileges and immunities grounds regarding those procedures.

Approximately six months after the strike had ended, the parents caused a final judgment to be entered and then filed their notice of appeal. On appeal, the court found that because the strike about which the parents complained had ended before the final judgment was entered, it was clear that the requests for injunctive relief were moot and that the request for an order mandating binding arbitration of the underlying labor dispute was also moot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The receiver filed an action for the judicial foreclosure of a trust deed and a deficiency judgment against the homeowners. The receiver subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the circuit court. On appeal, the homeowner contended that the receiver was not entitled to a deficiency judgment, because the trust deed was given to secure the purchase price of the property. The court appealed the judgment, holding that the homeowners' trust deed was a commercial trust deed at the time of foreclosure, as defined in former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.770(4), and former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.770(3) permitted it to obtain a deficiency judgment, regardless of the anti-deficiency provisions for purchase money mortgages. Further, the court held that although a trust deed was deemed to be a mortgage on real property, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.715, conflict when the beneficiary judicially foreclosed a purchase money commercial trust deed. Thus, the court concluded that the application of Or. Rev.

They contended that the notice of the emergency suspension did not comply with ORS 183.430(2) and that there was not a sufficient showing of disorderly premises under OAR 845-06-045.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The license holders were notified by mail of an emergency suspension and a proposed cancellation of their license. They requested a hearing and the hearing examiner recommend a suspension, but not a cancellation. They alleged that the notice was fatally deficient because it did not comply with the statutory requirements and their due process rights were therefore violated. The hearing examiner had found that the notice may not have been adequate for the suspension because it did not include the violation of Oregon Liquor Control Commission rules that formed the substantive basis for suspension. However, the basis was the same as that for the cancellation notice, which had been received by the license holders, thereby curing any defect. On appeal, the court held that ORS 183.430(2) provided a basis for the Commission to suspend their license in order to protect the public health and safety. Because various types of ongoing disorderly conduct had been cited in the cancellation notice, and the licensees had been represented by counsel who vigorously cross examined witnesses, they had not been prejudiced by any deficiency in the suspension notice.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, &sect; 167.222(1) was not impermissibly vague under the Oregon Constitution. Defendant also contended that &sect; 167.222(1) was overbroad because it reached conduct protected by Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior case, the tax court held that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 294.080(3), interest earned on unsegregated county tax accounts belonged to the several taxing districts within the counties for whom the funds had been designated. As a result of the decision of the tax court, the county entered a stipulation with the districts for payment of the interest. The legislature subsequently passed 1985 Or. Laws ch. 162, &sect;&sect; 12, 13, which limited the liability of the counties to interest that accrued after a certain date. The county brought this action to recover the interest paid to the districts that had accrued before that date. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the county because the trial court properly determined that &sect;&sect; 12, 13 were constitutional. The districts did not have a vested right to the funds, and the legislature had the authority to enact the laws. Furthermore, the trial court and not the tax court had jurisdiction to consider the validity of &sect;&sect; 12, 13. The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in denying the districts' motion to file a second amended answer because the districts' proposed allegations did not constitute colorable claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) and a corporation, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which entered a judgment declaring Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.030(7) (repealed 1988) unconstitutional and dismissed a claim. After the legislature repealed &sect; 473.030(7), OLCC requested that the court remand the case with instructions to dismiss it. Plaintiff opposed the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had also sought to have the OLCC enjoined from allowing tax credits pursuant to &sect; 473.030(7) and required to collect amounts equal to past credits from the taxpayers that had received them. After the trial court granted partial summary judgment in plaintiff's favor on the constitutionality of &sect; 473.030(7), plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the other claim and moved for the entry of final judgment. In remanding the cause with instructions to dismiss the complaint as moot, the court found that neither &sect; 473.030(7) nor the issue of whether it was constitutional existed. The constitutionality of &sect; 473.030(7) was the only controversy which remained in the case, after plaintiff withdrew its claim for other relief, and the constitutional issue was the only issue on which the trial court made a substantive ruling. Plaintiff's argument that the trial court's declaration that &sect; 473.030(7) was unconstitutional implicitly carried with it some or all of the other relief that plaintiff sought explicitly in its complaint and explicitly decided to forego later in the proceedings was unavailing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court allowed OLCC's motion. The cause was remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to kidnapping in the first degree, a Class A felony. The trial court found that defendant suffered from a severe personality disorder. It further found that on the basis of past criminal activity, he had a propensity toward criminal conduct and that he was a dangerous offender. Based on such finding, the trial court sentenced him to 30 years imprisonment, with a minimum of 15 years pursuant to the dangerous offender statute,&nbsp;ORS 161.725. On appeal, defendant argued that the imposition of an enhanced sentence punished the &quot;status&quot; of suffering from a severe personality disorder and thereby violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment contained in Article I, section 16, and the Eighth Amendment. In affirming, the court noted that ORS 161.725 did not punish a person for having a severe personality disorder; rather, it merely reflected the legislative recognition that a person who had a severe personality disorder that caused him to commit dangerous crimes was less amenable to rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were the parents of three children. The family lived in a room constructed of plastic and wood inside a barn that was cold, wet, and had an overwhelming stench. The family used a coffee can as a toilet, which was full of urine and easily accessible to the children. In addition, the home contained a gasoline container with matches within easy reach of the children. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly convicted defendants of failing to provide adequate &quot;physical care&quot; for their children. As a result, the court rejected defendants' contention that, without actual physical harm, they could not have been held liable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.200(1). Instead, the court held that no physical injury was required because the statute was intended to protect dependent persons from mistreatment other than physical violence and that such a construction did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, or the Fourteenth Amendment, as defendants had alleged. Furthermore, the court held that the statute was not impermissible vague and that the statute provided fair notice.

Appellant was in a bowling alley after the hour of curfew according to an ordinance of Multnomah County, Oregon. A police officer approached appellant and arrested him for a curfew violation. In a search incident to the arrest, the officer found a cloth pouch, some baggies, and cash. Appellant gave the officer permission to look in the pouch, which contained methamphetamine. Affirming, the court found no error. Under ORS 419.760, the police could take a minor into custody for violation of a curfew ordinance. The minor had to be taken into custody according to the procedures in ORS 419.569. The court concluded that the only way to interpret the statutes meaningfully was to construe ORS 419.760 to be read to grant authority to take a child into custody for a curfew violation, as long as it was done within the procedures set out in ORS 419.569.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party appealed a certification of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County, (Oregon), which dismissed his claim alleging punitive damages, compensatory damages in excess of the limits of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.270, and attorney fees in connection with his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against defendants, Multnomah County, City of Gresham and individual police officers, for the police officers' alleged physical and verbal assault on him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party asserted a &sect; 1983 violation against defendants for an alleged physical attack on him by the police officers and sought punitive damages, compensatory damages of $ 110,000, and attorney fees. Defendants made a motion to strike the injured party's allegations of damages which the trial court granted on the ground that the injured party's remedy was subject to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.270, which limited the liability of public bodies and their employees acting within the scope of their employment to $ 100,000 per claimant, prohibited the award of punitive damages, and was silent with respect to attorney fees. The injured party appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the injured party could not recover punitive damages or compensatory damages in excess of the limits of &sect; 30.270 because 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not provide a basis for concluding that Congress intended &sect; 1983 to preempt the Oregon statutory direction. The court held that &sect; 1988 expressly provided for attorney fee awards in &sect; 1983 actions and, although there was no basis for an award of fees under Oregon law, the express language of &sect; 1988 was preemptive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's certification of the dismissal of the injured party's claim for punitive damages and for compensatory damages in excess of statutory limits. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's certification of the dismissal of the injured party's claim for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed as a high school girls' basketball coach. While traveling by bus to a game, he allegedly touched a team member on &quot;the thigh area and between her breasts.&quot; Defendant's motion for an acquittal at the close of the State's case was denied. The court considered whether the indictment sufficiently alleged the crime of sexual abuse in the second degree. If the indictment was insufficient to charge the offense that it purported to state, then it was insufficient to support a trial. Subjecting another person to nonconsensual sexual contact constituted the crime of sexual abuse in the second degree, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.415. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.305(6) prohibited any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person. The court interpreted the meaning of &quot;sexual or other intimate parts&quot; and held that there was no basis in the language of the statute or in the legislative history on which to conclude that a human &quot;thigh area&quot; or the area &quot;between female breasts&quot; were &quot;intimate parts.&quot; The court could not permit the legislative intent to be determined by the trier of fact. Thus, the indictment failed to allege a crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Around 2:40 a.m., the driver approached a DUII roadblock and made a legal U-turn before reaching it. An officer, assigned to stop vehicles that appeared to be avoiding the roadblock, stopped the driver, noticed an odor of alcohol, and asked him to perform field sobriety tests. The driver was arrested after he took a breath test which disclosed a blood alcohol content of 0.15 percent. The trial court reversed his subsequent license suspension by the MVD on the ground that there was not a valid stop and that the exclusionary rule barred all evidence admitted as a result of the illegal stop. The court held that when the legislature used the term &quot;arrest&quot; in former ORS 482.541 and former ORS 487.805, it meant a valid arrest. Accordingly, the police could not administer a breath test, and the MVD could not suspend driving privileges based on a breath test result, unless the driver was first validly arrested. The fact that the driver made a legal U-turn and was slow to stop in response to the officer's flashing lights did not constitute a reasonable suspicion that the driver had committed a crime or a traffic violation. Thus, the stop and subsequent arrest were not valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents appealed a decision from the Circuit Court, Coos County (Oregon), which found that defendants, the administrators of state agencies involved in the care of children committed to secure custody by the juvenile court, could charge them for the support of their children under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.010 while they were in custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' children were found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.476(1)(a) for acts, which if committed by an adult, would be crimes, and committed to a secure training school or temporary work and training camp. The parents sued the administrators, challenging the state's policy of charging them for the care of their children while in state custody. The trial court entered summary judgment for the administrators and dismissed the case. On appeal, the court found that the parents stated a valid claim under Or. Const. art I, &sect; 20 when they claimed that the state's interest in enforcing the statutory obligation of parents to support their minor children was applied inconsistently as between the parents and the parents of children convicted of crimes as adults and then placed in secure custody until they turned 18, who were not charged with the support of their children. The court held that the parents should have an opportunity to prove their claim before the trial court, and that if they succeeded, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 416.400-416.470 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Part of the district's undeveloped property was included in a Local Improvement District (LID) formed for the improvement of a road over its objection. The city adopted the recommendations of a Board of Viewers for apportionment of the assessment and adopted an ordinance authorizing the city recorder to establish a lien docket. The trial court reversed the city's decision, holding that it had excluded property from the LID that was specifically benefitted by the improvement. On appeal, the court held that where the school district did not directly challenge its assessment, but argued that the cost of the improvement was not distributed widely enough, the court had to determine whether the trial court had jurisdiction. The court held that it did because the process was quasi-judicial. The court held that the decision to excluded the properties in question from the LID was not arbitrary because the city's decision was supported by substantial evidence. Benefit was a question of fact to be decided on a case by case basis. The trial court also misapplied Wilsonville, Oregon Ordinance 70, &sect; 6.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 746. 515.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An agency asked the broker to locate insurance companies that would provide insurance for the agency's clients. When the policies were issued, the broker asked the company to finance the premiums on some of the policies, which the company agreed to do. When the agency lost its license, the broker paid an amount equal to the unearned premiums to the company because the broker believed that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 746.515 required the broker to take such action. The broker then brought the instant action, and the circuit court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. The broker appealed, and the court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court held that the amended complaint alleged facts which, if true, showed that the company, as promisor, could satisfy an actual or asserted duty of the insureds, as promisee, to the broker, as beneficiary, by performance of the promise.  Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 746.515 did not require an insurer to &quot;return&quot; unearned premiums if no premiums had been paid to it or its agent. The return of money necessarily implied that it had been received. Nothing in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 746.515 created an obligation that the broker collect premiums for the company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesaler brought the declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of statutes regulating the sale of fireworks. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statutes. On review, the court affirmed and held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 480.156 did not violate the Commerce Clause. A wholesaler's reasonable belief that a permit was valid would provide a defense to a prosecution for violation of the statute and, thus, the application of the statute could have only incidental effects on interstate commence. Further, the statute advanced a legitimate local public interest in the safety of the citizens of the State. Oregon's interest in the safety of its citizens clearly outweighed any incidental impact on interstate commerce. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 480.156 was not unconstitutionally vague because the wording was sufficiently specific to inform a person of what conduct was prohibited. It was clear that a wholesale sale of fireworks could not be made to a non-Oregon resident unless the purchaser had a permit, if a permit was required by the laws of the non-resident's state.</SPAN></P>

The prejudice contemplated by &sect; 33.020(1) had to be directly related to the proceeding for which the defendant had been held in contempt. The court held that it could not say that the loss of defendant's testimony actually prejudiced the state. The statute required a finding of actual prejudice. Further, the court held that the legislature had the authority to limit the court's power to punish for contempt where the court was a creature of the legislature and not constitutionally established.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a minor political party and related individuals, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), which was entered in favor of defendants, the Oregon Secretary of State and the Oregon Director of Elections and Public Records Division. Plaintiffs had filed a declaratory judgment action, contending that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 248.008, 249.732 violated the First Amendment and portions of the Oregon Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 248.008 and 249.732 violated the First Amendment, various provisions of the Oregon Constitution pertaining to political, expression, and association rights, and the right to equal privileges and immunities assured by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Their principal argument was that the five percent requirement for petitions under both of the challenged statutes set an unduly high threshold for placement on the ballot. Therefore, according to plaintiffs, the requirement ran afoul of the criteria that the United States Supreme Court and other courts had established for ballot qualification. Affirming, the court held that the United States Supreme Court had already upheld a Georgia statute that set a five percent petition requirement for independent or minor party candidates to qualify for the general election ballot, and Oregon statutes pertaining to ballot access were no more restrictive than the Georgia statutes previously considered by the United States Supreme Court. The court also found nothing that suggested that the analysis in the First Amendment cases was not equally appropriate in connection with the Oregon Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that a police officer observed defendant drive a dump truck, on a public highway, loaded with gravel and pulling a trailer with an asphalt spreader. The officer noted that the truck had expired tags and did not have a proper permit, as required by ORS &sect; 767.105. After he was stopped, defendant unsuccessfully searched the truck for a permit and explained that the truck belonged to his father, for whom he worked. The officer testified that defendant did not dispute that he needed a proper permit. Defendant contended that he was entitled to an acquittal because the State failed to present evidence that he had intended to drive the truck without the proper permit. On appeal, the court reasoned that pursuant to ORS &sect; 161.105 if a criminal offense constituted a violation rather than a crime, no culpable mental state was required, unless stated in ORS &sect; 767.105. The court held that in designating the offense a violation rather than a crime, ORS &sect; 767.105 clearly indicated a legislative intent to dispense with any culpable mental state requirement. Accordingly, a culpable mental state was not an element of the offense, and defendant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city without stating its reasons on the record. On appeal the court reversed, holding that: (1) the trial court erred in awarding the city summary judgment on the OTCA claim because Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, petitioners appealed judgments from the Circuit Court, Deschutes County (Oregon) that denied their petitions for post-conviction relief from convictions for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), in violation of a city ordinance, which, pursuant to former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.015, proscribed exactly the same conduct and provided the same penalties as the state DUII statute, former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.540.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners claimed that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510(1) was unconstitutional under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, and the federal constitution, because it allowed post-conviction remedies to persons convicted of violating the state DUII statute but denied those remedies to persons who, like petitioners, although guilty of the same conduct, were convicted under a municipal ordinance. The court agreed with petitioners that, when the legislature granted a &quot;privilege&quot; to some, Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 required that the privilege be available &quot;upon the same terms&quot; to any citizen or class of citizens. The interest in the availability of a procedure by which to vindicate constitutional violations outweighed any state justification for the deprivation of that interest. The court ruled that the language in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510(1), &quot;the laws of this state,&quot; included convictions for violations of municipal ordinances when an ordinance was required by statute to be essentially the same as a state statute that prohibited the same conduct and provided the same penalties. To the extent that that they held to the contrary, the court overruled three prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgments that denied the petitions for post-conviction relief that were filed by petitioners.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court construed the &sect; 163.275(1)(a) narrowly to eliminate possible applications that would render it unconstitutionally overbroad. The court concluded that the fear instilled in the other person had to be objectively reasonable, the physical injury that was feared had to be objectively reasonable, and the person to whom the injury was threatened had to be a specific person.

The term commercial paper in the securities law included only unsecured short term negotiable debt instruments issued by commercial entities. Whether the security fell within the class of exempt securities was a fact peculiarly within the personal knowledge of defendant. It was not unreasonable to require defendant to present proof of the exemption. The security in this case was not exempt.

It had to be either a Class A felony or any lesser felony that seriously endangered the life or safety of another under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.725(2). The lower court could determine as a matter of law whether the crime for which defendant was convicted was a felony and whether it was a Class A or a lesser felony.

The court held that, in light of an analogous civil case, the distinction was not unconstitutional, particularly because a defendant could chose whether to put himself in the less advantageous appellate category.

Arguing that a condition of probation that he not enter Coos County except for court appearances upon written court authorization was unconstitutionally cruel or excessive, defendant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Coos County (Oregon), which modified a condition of his probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was under an order restraining him from having any contact with his wife, he drove two and one-half hours to her home with a weapon and assaulted her and struggled with her boyfriend. For this incident, defendant was charged with three counts of burglary in the first degree, one count of assault in the fourth degree, and one count of harassment, from which his appeal stemmed. The court reversed the judgment. The court noted that an excessive or unusual punishment was one that was unrelated to the offense or that went beyond that necessary to accomplish the purpose of the punishment. The court found that, although precluding defendant from entering Coos County without permission promoted the purpose of protecting the victims in this case, it was broader than necessary to accomplish that purpose. The geographical restriction was unnecessarily broad, as defendant was not shown to pose a threat to anyone outside of his wife's area. The trial court could draw a more limited geographical area. If the area was sufficiently limited, the court could properly require defendant to obtain permission, on a showing of justification, to enter that area.</SPAN></P>

At issue was whether the police had authority to take defendant's blood without a warrant, and whether they had authority to test it for its alcohol content without a warrant. Defendant was the driver in a one-car accident, in which his passenger was killed. The court was satisfied that the officers had probable cause to believe that defendant had been drinking alcohol and that alcohol was a factor in causing the accident. When the police directed that blood be taken at the hospital, defendant was under &quot;actual or constructive restraint&quot; so as to be under arrest for purposes of ORS 133.005(1). Because defendant was under arrest when his blood was drawn, the taking of blood samples while he was unconscious did not violate either the federal or state constitution. The vials of blood did not belong to defendant; thus, no search was involved in opening the vials and there was no additional seizure of the blood in testing its blood alcohol content.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1972, a circuit court, sitting as a juvenile court pursuant to former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.533(3), ordered all cases involving traffic offenses to be remanded to municipal court. In 1985, a 15-year-old was cited for traffic offenses. Pursuant to the &quot;blanket&quot; remand order, he was cited into municipal court. A circuit court denied the child's motion that the citations be remanded to juvenile court. The motion was denied and the court, on appeal, affirmed, ruling first that the case was not moot because it turned on whether the blanket remand order was valid as to a child who was then 15. While the child argued that statutory language limited blanket remand orders to traffic cases involving children 16 and over, the court disagreed. Given the statute's legislative history, the court found no legislative intention that the blanket remand language was subject to an age limit. Finally, the statute did not unconstitutionally discriminate against children under 16, because allowing prosecution of juveniles in adult courts for traffic offenses was a rational alternative to glutting juvenile courts with offenders who would not profit from rehabilitative efforts of the juvenile system.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 482.593(1), because she was 17 years old and violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 471.430, which prohibited persons under 21 from possessing alcohol. Thereafter, she was convicted for driving while suspended. She appealed, arguing that the statute under which her driver's license was suspended violated the Oregon Constitution. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the group to whom the privilege of driving was denied was not a suspect class because it was not based upon an immutable personal characteristic that could be suspected of reflecting prejudice or stereotyped prejudgment. Further, the law bore a rational relationship to the State's legitimate interest in deterring drug and alcohol possession and use among young people and the promotion of highway safety. The court also found that the interest in possessing a driver's license was outweighed by the State's goals of promoting highway safety and deterring drug and alcohol use. Finally, the court found that the loss of driving privileges was not a disproportionate penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Douglas County (Oregon) set aside an indictment charging defendant with aggravated murder. The offense was committed after defendant had escaped from a state penal and correctional facility. The indictment was set aside on the ground that the statute under which defendant was charged, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(2)(f), was unconstitutional because it imposed an unconstitutional sentence. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that &sect; 163.095(2)(f) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, the privileges and immunities provision, because there was no rational basis for imposing a more severe penalty for a murder committed by an individual on escape status than the penalty imposed on an individual who was in the process of escaping. The trial court also held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(2)(f) violated U.S. Const. amend VIII because being an escapee was not an aggravating circumstance which genuinely narrowed the class of persons eligible for the death penalty or reasonably justified the imposition of a more severe sentence on defendant compared to others found guilty of murder. The court stated that &sect; 163.095(2)(f) did not impose any penalty but merely defined a crime. The court also stated that (1) the sentencing statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.105(1), provided for the arguably unconstitutional sentence only after a conviction of aggravated murder, and defendant had not yet been convicted of any crime, much less aggravated murder; and (2) defendant could be sentenced for the lesser-included offense of murder. Thus, it was error to set aside the indictment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also raised the issue of double jeopardy after his first trial ended abruptly in a mistrial. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury hearing on whether double jeopardy barred his second trial. The court found that the witness' highly prejudicial answer which caused the mistrial was not expected by the prosecution, and thus, the State neither intended nor was indifferent to the mistrial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with one count of aggravated murder in violation of Or. Rev.

Both defendants moved for dismissal of the aggravated murder counts, and in substantially identical pretrial orders the trial court granted the motions, holding that Or. Rev.

I, &sect; 20 and &sect; 21, The statute elevated murder to aggravated murder when it is committed in the course of torture. The legislature had not provided a statutory definition of torture, and the trial court reasoned that, in the absence of a definition, courts and juries were powerless to define and apply the term to the facts of a given case. The State appealed. The court affirmed because an allegation of murder by torture under the statute could not have been submitted constitutionally to a jury because a jury would have been allowed impermissibly to determine a defendant's guilt in an ad hoc manner, unregulated by legislative standards.</SPAN></P>

Code (SRC) 100.330, which was enacted on June 14, 1982, prohibiting DUII. Defendant appealed his conviction to the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon) and moved to dismiss the charge, contending that SRC 100.330 was invalid. The motion was denied, and defendant was convicted again of the offense after a trial de novo in the circuit court. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">SRC 100.330, the local ordinance under which defendant was tried and convicted, adopted by reference several State statutes prohibiting DUII and other vehicle-related crimes, one of those being former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.540 which prohibited driving with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .10 percent or higher. In October 1983, the State legislature repealed &sect; 487.540 and immediately reenacted the same law with a prohibition against driving with a BAC of .08 percent or higher. In January 1984, defendant was arrested and cited for DUII in violation of the local ordinance. Defendant's BAC was .20 percent. In July 1984, the local ordinance was amended to conform to the .08 percent limit of amended &sect; 487.540. Defendant contended that the amendment of &sect; 487.540 rendered the local ordinance pursuant to which he was convicted invalid because the ordinance no longer incorporated existing State law. The court, limiting the appeal to issues concerning the constitutionality of the local ordinance, dismissed the appeal. The court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional because the city which adopted it had not attempted to adopt future amendments to &sect; 487.540.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Oregon appealed the judgment of the District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which sustained defendant's demurrer and dismissed the charge against him for the unlawful possession of steelhead trout. The charge was dismissed on the ground that the unlawful possession of steelhead did not constitute an offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that defendant violated Or. Admin. R. 635-06-230. Defendant argued that the mere possession of steelhead was not prohibited by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 509.031. The State claimed that &sect; 509.031 authorized the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission to promulgate the regulation. Defendant argued that the Commission exceeded the scope of its delegated rulemaking authority. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer. Because the violation of any regulation promulgated by the Commission in carrying out &sect; 509.031(1) was a Class A misdemeanor under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 506.991(1), the Commission did not exceed the scope of its delegated authority when it declared that violating the prohibition set forth in Or. Admin. R. 635-06-230 constituted an unlawful act. If the State did not prove that defendant possessed the steelhead for purposes other than to deliver it to the State, it would not prove a violation. Additionally, the court found no unlawful delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

Although it was not a sworn statement, it was certified as true. The statement required by &sect; 251.085 was one of fact, and defendant's educational background was a verifiable fact that was not open to dispute or debate.

The court determined that nudity alone did not take dancing out of the realm of expression protected by Or. Const. art.

The court held that the portions of the ordinance, which prohibited nude dancing, were overbroad and invalid, but could be severed from the remainder of the ordinance. The court stated that the lower court erroneously found the other portions of the ordinance invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the District Court, Lane County (Oregon), which sustained defendant's demurrer to an indictment against him under ORS 166.470 (Oregon). Defendant was charged with the sale or transfer of a concealable firearm between nonlicensed persons when the purchaser was not personally known to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the &quot;not personally known&quot; component of the statute was unconstitutionally vague, in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Reversing, the court determined that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague in describing the prohibited conduct. The court noted that a vague statute failed to adequately apprise the public of what conduct was proscribed. A judicial interpretation could save a statute that was attacked as vague, but only if the construction maintained a reasonable fidelity to the legislature's words and apparent intent. The court concluded that, in the context of the statute, the words &quot;not personally known to the vendor&quot; could be interpreted to uphold the statute and give it meaning. The requirement had two aspects for a nonlicensed vendor. The vendor had to know the purchaser's identity and the vendor had to know the purchaser to the extent that he could reasonably believe that the purchaser was not within a class of persons prohibited from owning or possessing a concealable firearm. The words of the statute, in context, were not vague but conveyed a clear meaning that something that which judges and juries were capable of applying.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment entered against them in an action filed by the retailer to recover damages resulting from the arrest of defendants' daughter for shoplifting. The jury returned a verdict for the retailer, and defendants filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that the shoplifting statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.875(2), was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion, and on appeal the court refused to review the denial. On further appeal, the case was remanded for consideration on the assignment of error. Affirming the trial court's denial, the court held that the statute did not deny parents the right to choose how to teach their children or bar them from making decisions concerning them, but encouraged parents to teach lawful behavior. The court further held that the standard of review was not strict scrutiny, but whether the statute advanced a legitimate state purpose and whether the means chosen were rationally related to achieving that purpose. The court concluded that the deterrence of juvenile shoplifting was a legitimate state purpose and that the imposition of vicarious liability on parents was rationally related to that purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which declared that the Court Reorganization Act, 1981 Or. Laws 3, preempted a Multmomah County Home Rule charter provision for election of a district court clerk and that defendant was not entitled to a salary for the position. Plaintiffs cross-appealed from the award of attorney fees to defendant for trial and for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was elected by the county as district court clerk and a salary for the position was approved. As assistant to the district court administrator, defendant was paid a salary by the state as well. The lower court found that the Court Reorganization Act abolished the county office of district court clerk and defendant was not entitled to a salary for that office. Defendant asserted that the Act did not preempt the charter amendment, which created the office of district court clerk. Defendant conceded that under the Act the state took over the duties that had been assigned to him as district court clerk, but argued that the county should have assigned to him other duties that the state did not take over. The court found that the state's preemption of the duties of district court clerk did preempt the office and nullified it. Also, the state's preemption of all of the functions of the office of district court clerk did not impinge on the county's freedom to choose its own political form. Defendant was not entitled to a salary for holding a non-existent office. The court agreed that the lower court erred when it awarded attorney fees to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that defendant was not entitled to a salary for the position in question. The court reversed the award of attorney fees to defendant for trial and for appeal.</SPAN></P>

The school board adopted a resolution directing the superintendent and principal to include the prayer at the graduation. The objecting students filed suit, and the trial court issued an injunction prohibiting the school district from sponsoring, permitting or encouraging the inclusion of formal prayer at the graduation. The court affirmed, holding that the effect of the prayer was to create the impression that government was sponsoring or endorsing religion. The Oregon constitution forbade the majority of a population from compelling a graduation ceremony to be opened with a vocal, public prayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.103 was unconstitutional because it allowed the State to present evidence of a prior homicide conviction, unless defendant stipulated to it. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer to an indictment for aggravated murder. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for trial. The court held that the legislature could include a prior conviction for homicide as an element of aggravated murder. Permitting the introduction of a prior homicide conviction in the guilt determination phase of an aggravated murder trial did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 or &sect; 12. There was no merit in defendant's argument that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.103 compelled an accused to incriminate himself through a stipulation. Proof of the prior conviction was usually a mere formality. A defendant was not required to stipulate it, and if he chose not to, the State was required to prove the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed the conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, but reversed the conviction for burglary in the first degree and remanded for entry of conviction for burglary in the second degree and resentencing. The court determined that the trial court properly overruled the demurrer because the indictment at least charged burglary in the second degree, pursuant to Or. Rev.

Section 135.455 did not bar a defendant from denying his participation in a crime charged for failure to give a notice of alibi. However, there was substantial and convincing evidence of guilt.

Stat. &sect; 20.080, which, at the time when the an action was brought, provided for reasonable attorney fees in an action for damages for injury or wrong to the person or property, or both, of another where the amount pleaded was $ 3,000 or less. The carrier sought review of a judgment of the of only the attorney fees award, contending that liability for lost goods was governed by the Interstate Commerce Act. The carrier claimed that the Interstate Commerce Act preempted Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20.080 and that, therefore, attorney fees were not recoverable. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which awarded attorney fees to the shipper. The court held that the Interstate Commerce Act did not prohibit the recovery of attorney fees under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20.080. The state law was within the state's inherent powers and did not conflict with the Interstate Commerce Act or infringe its policy. In addition, there was no clear evidence of a congressional intent to preempt state law.</SPAN></P>

The boy was upset and described occurrences which were the basis for sodomy charges against defendant. Defendant admitted the facts, but he claimed that he believed the boy to be 15 years old. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and the denial of defendant's mistake of fact defense. The court examined the various sodomy statutes and the defense as to age provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.325 and found that it was not available to defendant. The court held that it had erroneously interpreted the defense to apply in another case, but upon examining legislative history it was clear that there was to be no defense of mistake of fact to the crime of sodomy or rape against a child under the age of 14 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of dissemination of obscene material. He demurred to the indictment on the ground that the facts stated did not constitute an offense because &sect; 167.087 was unconstitutional. He stipulated that he sold the magazines in question. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that because &sect; 167.087 was used by judges, juries, and potential defendants to assess the criminality of particular conduct, its definitions were not sufficiently precise to determine whether particular sexually explicit material was legally obscene. It was not acceptable, as a matter of state constitutional law, that the precise course of the line dividing obscene expression from protected expression be uncertain and that a person who chose to disseminate sexually explicit materials had to bear the risk of that uncertainty. The constitutional right to communicate freely on &quot;any subject whatever&quot; guaranteed by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, required more than the statute provided by way of guidance. A person who traded in sexually explicit materials could not discern that his wares were legally obscene under the statute, and a trial judge was left with no legal standard to apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Circuit Court, Josephine County (Oregon) with feloniously driving while suspended under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.560, repealed by 1983 Or. Laws ch. 338, &sect; 978. The trial court dismissed the indictment on the ground that defendant's guilty plea to driving under the influence of intoxicants, based on the same criminal episode, barred prosecution of the driving while suspended charge. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that prosecution of defendant on the charge of driving while suspended was not barred by his guilty plea to driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUI). The two charges were &quot;based on the same criminal episode&quot; as that term was used in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.515(2). However, the indictment on the driving while suspended charge was filed before he pleaded guilty to the DUI charge. Therefore, the indictment was not later than 30 days after the entry of the guilty plea. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.525(2) provided that defendant's guilty plea did not bar this prosecution. The statute allowed defendant to move to vacate the previous plea and judgment within 30 days of his arraignment on the driving while suspended charge. He did not do so. The omission of no contest pleas from Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.525(2) may have been due to legislative oversight; however, defendant could not base a privileges and immunities attack on the putative different double jeopardy effect of two pleas when it was his choice and not the government's that determined which results followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's dismissal of defendant's indictment on a charge of driving while suspended and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The landowners sought to enjoin the defendants from expanding or using a way of necessity established pursuant to former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 376.105 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Years before this litigation commenced, the state declared a statutory way of necessity over three adjoining farms pursuant to former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 376.105 et seq. One farm was landlocked and could only be reached by the way of necessity, a gateway. The owner of one of the farms filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against his two neighbors. He sought to enjoin the landlocked neighbor from expanding its use of the gateway and to enjoin the other neighbor from using the gateway at all. The circuit court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court explained why the landowner was not entitled to relief as a matter of law. A statutory way of necessity was open to the public for anyone who wanted to use it. This included public roads or gateways used as access to residences and farms. The landlocked neighbor was clearly entitled to expand its use to serve additional residences on his property. The other neighbor was entitled to use the gateway not only as a member of the public but as an abutting property owner. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The action concerned an initiative petition and challenged official actions under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.484, and the Secretary's actions under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 246.910.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action sought to prohibit the processing and circulation of an initiative petition in favor of submitting a constitutional amendment to voters at a general election. The initiative petition concerned pay levels and pensions of public employees. Plaintiffs argued that the initiative petition violated the requirement under Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d), that such petitions could only concern one subject. The trial court held that pre-election review by courts to determine if the requirement was met was impermissible. The court affirmed the judgment. The legislature's use of &quot;proposed&quot; in &sect; 1(2)(d), and its failure to change &quot;act&quot; into &quot;bill&quot; in Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20, upon amendment, showed its intent regarding when judicial intervention was permissible. Given courts' holdings before the amendment of Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d), (4)(b), that single subject review was not available before elections, it was unlikely that &quot;proposed&quot; in Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d), was intended to change the prior holdings in a non-overt manner. The court found a preference against courts intervening in legislative processes or interfering with voters' abilities on referendum proposals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagee appealed from the order of the Circuit Court, Umatilla County (Oregon), which dismissed its complaint to challenge the validity of a tax foreclosure conducted by defendant county for failure to state a claim for relief pursuant to Or. R. Civ. P. 21A(8). The trial court held that newspaper publication of a foreclosure action under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 312.040(1) satisfied Fourteenth Amendment due process requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee did not have actual notice of the foreclosure until after the one-year redemption period expired. The statute formerly provided that newspaper publication of notice of foreclosure four times was sufficient to put all persons claiming an interest in the property on notice. A recent amendment, not applicable to the case, required mailed notice to record lienholders. On appeal, the court held that the Fourteenth Amendment required the state to provide notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of an action that affected a property interest, and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. The court held that the statute was constitutional as applied to a landowner because it supplemented at least three years of written notices of delinquency as well as a notice of the right of redemption. The court reversed and held that newspaper publication alone, without mailed or served notice, violated due process as to the holder of a recorded mortgage, notwithstanding the right of the mortgagee to make a request for mailed notice, because the state had an affirmative duty to provide sufficient notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court that had held that the mortgagee did not state a claim for relief. The court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor performed a vasectomy on one of his patients. The Board of Chiropractic Examiners learned of the surgery and notified the chiropractor that it intended to revoke his license on the ground that chiropractors were not authorized to perform vasectomies under Oregon law. At the hearing, the chiropractor did not deny performing the vasectomy, but argued that a vasectomy was &quot;minor surgery&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 684.010(4). The Board disagreed. It found that a vasectomy was not &quot;minor surgery&quot; and that, therefore, it was prohibited &quot;major surgery.&quot; The chiropractor's first assignment raised the issue of whether the Board was required to promulgate rules defining &quot;major surgery&quot; and further defining &quot;minor surgery&quot; before applying those statutory terms. On appeal, the court affirmed the finding of the Board holding that while the question of what was &quot;minor surgery&quot; was a question of law for the courts, they Board had not erred in determining that the vasectomy was &quot;major surgery.&quot; The court held further that the appearance of impropriety concerning extra record discussions required a redetermination of the appropriate sanction to impose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural father's personal representative sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.381 could not be applied to validate an adoption decree void for lack of consent or notice and which entered a judgment for respondents, a natural mother's personal representative and a daughter, in an action to vacate a decree of adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave birth to an illegitimate daughter. The mother's father adopted the child. The mother neither consented to the adoption nor received notice of the adoption proceedings. In 1947, the child's adopted mother told the mother about the adoption. The mother filed an action to vacate the adoption decree in 1984. The mother died after filing the action. The trial court entered a judgment for the mother's personal representative and the child. On appeal, the court held that the adoption decree was void when it was entered because the adoption court had no jurisdiction to enter it without consent from or notice to the mother. However, if the legislature had power to bar challenges to tax foreclosure decrees void for want of jurisdiction, it could perceive no reason why it could not do so with respect to adoption decrees. Section 109.381 reflected a legislative purpose to lend finality to adoption decrees, even those arising out of proceedings suffering from jurisdiction defects. The mother had one year from the 1959 enactment of &sect; 109.381 to challenge the decree. That was a reasonable time period. Thus, her attack on the adoption decree was barred by &sect; 109.381.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision. The case was remanded with instructions to reinstate the adoption decree.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged dismissal of the charge of indecent exposure against defendant, arguing that the trial court erred in granting defendant's demurrer and in holding the city's indecent exposure ordinance was overbroad. Defendant had argued that the ordinance was overbroad because some of the conduct it proscribed was protected speech. The trial court agreed. The trial court held that Portland, Or., City Code &sect; 14.24.060 unconstitutionally outlawed the act of exposure itself, that is the nudity. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment, holding that a statute that reached constitutionally protected behavior only rarely when compared with legitimate applications of the law need not succumb to an overbreadth attack. The court held that such a statute could be interpreted as impliedly excluding the protected activity from coverage. The court held that Portland, Or., City Code &sect; 14.24.060 was focused on the goal of regulating conduct determined to be injurious to the public health, safety, and morals by prohibiting public nudity or indecent exposure not intended as a protected symbolic or communicative act. The court remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

The teacher sought judicial review of the order of the superintendent, as provided for by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.480(1).

The court noted that sanctions for behavior far more serious than wearing religious dress were not so severe.

Defendant contended that the statute was therefore unconstitutionally overbroad. The court addressed the appeal to the Oregon Constitution and did not address defendant's U.S. Const. amends.

The statute prohibited furnishing minors with any printed matter containing &quot;dirty words&quot; no matter how incidental the objectionable language was in the context of the work as a whole, and while constitutional protections were more limited in respect to minors than to adults, such a prohibition was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in granting the directed verdict. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action for trial. The court held that the testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness and other evidence was sufficient to present a jury question as to whether the four elements of a legal malpractice claim were proven. The court noted that plaintiffs' expert witness testified that the other lawyer did not exercise the ordinary care and diligence used by lawyers in the community because he failed to prepare an agreement that would not have subjected plaintiffs to future liability, and because he failed to inform plaintiffs of their potential liability to the corporation's creditors.</SPAN></P>

Defendant demurred on the ground that ORS 163.555(1) (Or.) was unconstitutionally vague. The Circuit Court, Douglas County (Oregon), overruled his demurrer. Defendant was found guilty of one count, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction of violating ORS 163.555(1), contending that the phrase &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; in ORS 163.555(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed. The phrase &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; did not confuse or mislead defendants to the slightest degree as to their duty to support their minor children. It was commonly understood that a &quot;lawful excuse&quot; referred to some condition, not of defendant's own making, which prevented defendant from being able to provide support. The state satisfied its burden by showing (1) there was a court mandate that defendant pay child support, (2) he had an ability to generate an income, and in fact had earned wages during the time period in question, and (3) he had made no payment in any amount towards his child support obligation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned for reconsideration of an affirmance of a judgment from the Lane County Circuit Court (Oregon), which convicted defendant for solicitation to possess a controlled substance, cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.435 forbade only solicitation of Oregon crimes and his substantive crime was a California offense, the charging instrument failed to allege that delivery of cocaine was a crime in California, and &sect; 161.435, if applicable to foreign crimes, was unconstitutional. The court granted the reconsideration but affirmed the conviction. One could be criminally liable in Oregon for soliciting the commission of a crime in another state, so long as that other state's offense had a counterpoint under Oregon law. Possession of cocaine was illegal in both Oregon and California. It was therefore permissible to charge defendant with the crime of soliciting possession of cocaine in California. This was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to another state because it expressed legitimate policy and contained sufficient procedural protections to guard against arbitrary application. Section 161.435 was not vague as to defendant because defendant did not need to speculate whether his conduct would be an offense in another jurisdiction. Matters of judicial notice, including the law of another state, need not be alleged in a charging instrument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee last worked for defendant employer on May 5th, but defendant agreed to pay plaintiff additional salary in lieu of notice of termination. Defendant made salary payments May 13th and May 27th, and paid vacation pay in July. The trial court found that plaintiff's termination date was May 5th, that defendant had violated Or. Rev.

Stat. 652.200(2). The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that defendant was not relieved of its obligation for immediate payment of wages as of the date of termination simply because the additional wages were voluntarily offered by defendant. The penalty was appropriate when defendant's actions were wilful when it knew that it was not making payments on plaintiff's termination date. The statutory provision for attorney's fees only to successful plaintiffs under Or. Rev.

In reversing the order that excluded the blood test results as to the assault charge, affirming in all other matters, and remanding for trial, the court held that probable cause and exigent circumstances justified taking the blood sample without defendant's consent. The Implied Consent law did not govern the admissibility of otherwise competent, relevant evidence in prosecutions for offenses other than DUII. The taking of the blood sample was not an unconstitutional search and seizure. The assault charge and the DUII charge were not so intertwined that evidence inadmissible as to one had to necessarily be excluded as to the other. Defendant could have the two charges severed, with separate trials being held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order excluding blood test results as to the assault charge. Otherwise, the court affirmed and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The actuary was employed by the state accident insurance fund. The fund decided to buy a fleet of cars. The actuary purchased a car as an &quot;add-on&quot; to the fleet purchase. The car was ordered in the fund's name and the title was later transferred to the actuary, who saved approximately $ 1,300 in comparison to what the car would have cost to an average consumer. The commission found the actuary used his official position to obtain financial gain for himself. The actuary argued the statute applied to more narrow situations where a public official used the power or influence of his office to obtain financial gain and that the term &quot;use&quot; in &sect; 244.040(1) meant only influence peddling. The court affirmed the commission's order and held that three other statutes effectively dealt with influence peddling and the term &quot;use&quot; in the statute at issue was intended to be a broad catch-all provision to cover many types of unethical behavior. The court gave the term its ordinary meaning and determined that the actuary used his position to purchase the car.</SPAN></P>

From a subsequent judgment order overruling his objections and admitting the will to probate in solemn form, the contestant appealed.

Stat. &sect; 113.055(4), which provided that in the event of a will contest, proof of any facts should be made in the same manner as in an action tried without a jury, violated Or. Const. art.

Affirming, the court held that the changes were procedural and not substantive. They were not intended to alter, and did not alter, substantive rights such as the right to trial by jury or the lack thereof.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent unions sought judicial review of the decision of the Employment Relations Board (ERB) (Oregon), which found that the unions had committed an unfair labor practice by spending a portion of complainant employees' fair share dues for unauthorized purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were non-union employees who benefited from the unions' collective bargaining. The unions charged the employees fair share dues to pay support the unions' collective bargaining activities. The employees filed a complaint under the Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.650 et seq., challenging the imposition of fair share dues. The court affirmed the ERB's decision holding that the unions had committed an unfair labor practice by spending a portion of the employees' fair share dues for unauthorized purposes. Unions could use fair share dues to support some legitimate political involvement and had some latitude in determining the best means of promoting the legitimate negotiations and contract administration objectives of the bargaining unit. If a union knew in advance that a portion of fair share dues would be used for purposes not germane to or supportive of collective bargaining negotiations and contract administration, it had to reduce the fair share dues pro-rata In advance. The employees were entitled to interest at the statutory rate for any amount of fair share dues that the ERB concluded on remand was used unlawfully.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no constitutional privilege fraudulently to misrepresent facts in order to obtain another's property, signature to a written instrument or execution of a written instrument affecting a pecuniary interest. All of defendant's hypotheticals involved such misrepresentations. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.042 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.102 were not overbroad and were constitutional under Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A general contractor subcontracted with the lessee to construct a new roof on a stadium.

One of the lessee's employes was killed, and his personal representative brought an action against the lessor for negligence. The lessor asserted a claim against the lessee based on the indemnity provisions of the lease agreements. The trial court held that the indemnity agreements in the lease were void under Or. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 656.018(1)(c), the lessee's duty to provide workers' compensation coverage was its exclusive liability for injuries to its workers, and thus the indemnity agreement was void. The court further held that the statute did not unreasonably interfere with the right to contract guaranteed by Or. Const. art.

The court affirmed the judgment. The court observed that whether or not the daughter had shoplifted, there was no evidence from which the jury could find that there had been a &quot;consumer transaction&quot; between her and the store owner. The court determined that the trial court's comments to the jury were harmless. The court pointed out that while the trial court erred when it admitted the guard's testimony and report, the jury's conclusion from other testimony was inescapable that the daughter intended to and did shoplift and the admission of the report and testimony was therefore harmless. The court commented that evidence of the store owner's actual damages from the daughter's acts was clearly relevant and that if there was any error in admitting the other evidence, it was cured by an instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted an ordinance that regulated outdoor advertising through billboards. The corporation made constitutional and other challenges to the ordinance on the basis that the county regulated only advertising that had &quot;commercial&quot; content and &quot;noncommercial&quot; outdoor advertising was completely exempt from regulation. The board rejected the challenges. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the content-based distinction in the way that different kinds of constitutionally equal speech were regulated could not be salvaged by the fact that the regulation restricted only the time, place, and manner of engaging in the expression that had been selected for regulation. The court held that the ordinance violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it regulated one kind of speech and not another, based on the difference in their content. The court held that the county could have no constitutionally acceptable interest in regulating commercial and noncommercial expression differently because of the content. The court held that the ordinance also violated the equal privileges and immunities requirement of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured employer argued that 1979 Or. Laws ch. 829 was a special law prohibited by Or. Const. art.

The court found that the SAIF Corporation was not a corporation in the ordinary sense of the word, even though it had some attributes generally considered necessary for corporate existence. The SAIF Corporation was neither a private corporation nor a corporation created for a municipal purpose. The court held that Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2 did not prohibit the legislature from clothing a state instrumentality that it created with some corporate attributes when that entity was created for a statewide, not municipal, public purpose and was subject to public management and control. The SAIF Corporation was such an entity. It was given limited corporate attributes to enable it to carry out its function of transacting the workers' compensation insurance business formerly transacted by another entity.</SPAN></P>

Each of the charges were brought in separate indictments but were consolidated for trial. He contended that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges stemmed from defendant's relationship with a 15-year old girl who lived with his family and his alleged attempts to start her in business as a prostitute. He challenged the admission of evidence of a similar relationship with another girl. The trial court allowed the evidence as relevant to a related charge for which he was not convicted and he had not requested a limiting charge. The court therefore held that there was no error. Defendant also claimed that ORS 163.355 was unconstitutional because he was not allowed to assert that he thought she was over age 16. He contended that there was no rational basis for not requiring him to have knowledge of the fact that she was under age 16, thereby subjecting defendant to strict liability. The court held that the legislature had reduced the penalties for intercourse with girls under age 14 by requiring knowledge of the victim's age, but retained at least some penalty by not requiring suck knowledge for intercourse with a girl under age 16. Therefore ORS 163.355 was not an equal protection violation, and the attachment of responsibility for a crime of which he ignorant of the facts was not a due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed one of defendant's convictions for rape in the third degree, but affirmed his other convictions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 472.180(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence presented before the Commission showed that male dancers had contact with female patrons in a sexually suggestive manner, including the touching of genitalia.

The court rejected the licensee's contention that the word &quot;lewd&quot; in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 472.180(5) was unconstitutionally vague. The Commission's interpretation of &quot;lewd&quot; as &quot;lustful, indecent, lascivious, or lecherous&quot; was consistent with the court's interpretation of the term in prior cases, and with the generally expressed legislative policy. The term indicated with sufficient specificity the proscribed conduct so that men of ordinary understanding could govern their activities, and, consequently it was not unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected the licensee's contention that the Commission erred in failing to consider adequately their defenses to the charges of allowing minors to enter and consume alcoholic beverages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the trial court had erred in failing to suppress certain tape-recorded statements because the application on which the order authorizing the interception had been based had failed to demonstrate the inadequacy of alternative investigative procedures as required by the wiretap statutes,&nbsp;ORS 133.724(1)(h), 133.724(3)(c) (Oregon). The court concluded that the application and supporting affidavits provided sufficient factual information from which the trial court could find that normal investigative procedures had been tried and had failed or reasonably appeared to be unlikely to succeed if tried. The court also determined that there was evidence, independent of defendant's admissions, that the murder had been for hire. It was enough if there was some proof, circumstantial or otherwise, from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that defendant had received money for the murder. As to the severity of defendant's sentence, Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's son and daughter filed a will contest to their father's will based on grounds that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity; the will was the product of undue influence by his former wife, and the will was the product of an insane delusion. The contestants withdrew the first two grounds and submitted the case only on the grounds of the will being the product of an insane delusion. The trial court ruled against them and the contestants appealed. The court affirmed the judgment holding that the contestants failed to sustain their burden of proving that decedent's will was the product of insane delusions because the record included sufficient evidence to support decedent's belief that neither of his children liked him, and that they were primarily interested in his money. The court noted testimony from the attorney who prepared decedent's will that he discussed decedent's proposed will before it was executed and the decedent was very clear that he desired to disinherit his children because he did not like them and they did not like him, and also because they had already received part of his estate indirectly when their mother died.</SPAN></P>

During this probationary period, the probation officer searched defendant's residence and found a knife, a broken pool cue, drug paraphernalia, and some marijuana seeds. Defendant had also withdrawn from a course at school, without informing the officer. At his revocation hearing, the court ordered that defendant not reside in Troutdale, Oregon, and that he serve one year in county jail with school release privileges. Defense counsel objected to the provision restricting defendant from residing in Troutdale as unconstitutional. The court ordered counsel to present a more refined definition, but counsel did not submit one. Defendant appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the provision that he not reside in Troutdale was excessive, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;138.050, in light of the offense. The court held that the restriction should have been more narrowly drawn, and could be modified to reasonably restrict his residency within Troutdale. The court affirmed the remainder of the order, finding that the imposition of jail time was supported by the various violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of conviction of the crime of driving under the influence of intoxicants entered against him in the District Court, Coos County (Oregon). Defendant challenged the trial judge's denial of his pretrial motion for change of judge and the refusal to grant a hearing on his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was improper for the trial judge to rule on the motion. The trial judge's refusal to recuse himself was based on defendant's failure timely to file the motion, as required by ORS 14.260 (Oregon). Accordingly, if the motion was untimely the trial judge did not act improperly by ruling on defendant's motion. Defendant argued, in support of his first assignment, that his motion was in fact timely. The court on appeal did not find that defendant's motion was untimely filed. It was obvious that a defendant in a multi-judge district would have no reason to object to a particular judge until he knew which judge has been assigned to his case. ORS 14.260 specifically provided that the proper way to establish prejudice was to file a motion supported by affidavit that the judge before whom the cause, matter or proceeding was pending was prejudiced. In order to comply with that provision, a party must first know before whom the case was pending. The trial notice received by defendant did not indicate which judge would hear the case. The statutory time limits had not begun to run when the trial notice was sent and the denial of defendant's motion was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court on appeal reversed the judgment. The court on appeal also remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants became the target of a police undercover investigation of purchases and sales of salmon caught out of season. An undercover police officer sold defendants illegally caught fish. Defendants contended that the trial court erred in denying to dismiss the indictments and admitting at trial rebuttable evidence that one of the defendants had bought illegal sturgeon roe on other occasions. The salmon sold to defendants were illegally caught. The court determined that defendants knew that the salmon were illegally caught when they bought them. The court found that the fact that the state may sell illegal fish to prevent loss or spoilage did not alter the character of the fish to make them &quot;legally caught.&quot; The court concluded that defendants could not have benefited from the fact that the state had authority to sell fish under the circumstances described by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 506.690(2), 635-02-030. The court further found that defendants failed to explain how the probative value of the rebuttal testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion.

The court held that ORS 249.732 clearly contemplated that minor political party status required a candidate to achieve at least five percent of the votes cast in an electoral district in which the party previously offered a candidate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed and held that defendant was precluded from challenging the constitutionality of the charging statute on vagueness grounds because his behavior was unquestionably within the prohibited conduct of the statute. Defendant was charged with intentionally failing to appear at a sentencing hearing after the trial court had ordered him to appear. Defendant, a person of ordinary intelligence, would have had no difficulty knowing that his conduct, if performed with the requisite intent, fell within the ambit of the statutory prohibition. The record was clear that defendant left the state voluntarily. Through correspondence, he indicated to the district attorney that he never intended to return. The court could not see how defendant had been victimized by any uncertainty in the statute. He did not contend that the trial court lacked authority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City of Roseburg, Or., Municipal Code &sect; 10.04.060 prohibited the practice of occult arts for hire or profit within the city. The practitioners, who intended to open a palmistry business inside the city limits, had to find a business location beyond the city limits. They argued that the ordinance violated the free speech guarantees of the U.S. Const. amend. I and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court dismissed the city's cross-appeal after determining that the practitioners had standing. Their rights were affected by the ordinance and they had a direct and substantial interest in the controversy. Reversing the judgment, the court held that the ordinance was overbroad and therefore unconstitutional. The ordinance sought to restrict the practitioners' ability to speak about palmistry. Such a restriction fell squarely within the prohibitions of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court did not reach the practitioners' First Amendment argument. The case was remanded so that a judgment could be entered for the practitioners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter with instructions that the trial court enter a judgment for the practitioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's car was stopped, the officer turned on a tape recorder, asked defendant several questions, and conducted several field sobriety tests. Although she performed several tests adequately, she was unable to recite the alphabet accurately. Upon further questioning, defendant stated that she had been drinking, that she had always had difficulty reciting the alphabet rhyme, and that the alcohol she had consumed affected her ability to recite the alphabet. Defendant was then arrested and a subsequent breath test indicated a blood-alcohol level above the limit prescribed by &sect; 487.540(1)(a). On appeal, the court ruled that defendant's pre-Miranda, tape recorded statements properly were not suppressed because they were not the product of a custodial interrogation. Even if, under a then pending case on remand from the United States Supreme Court, she was subject to a custodial interrogation, the only suppressible statement was her admission that alcohol affected her recitation of the alphabet. Given the other evidence of guilt, the admission of that statement was harmless error, if any. Also, &sect; 487.540(1)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague, the court ruled.</SPAN></P>

He argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.665, applicable only to convicted defendants, was unconstitutional because it incorporated a reference to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.055(5). On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's determination. It held that the only portion of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.055 held unconstitutional was subsection (6). Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.665 referred only to subsection (5), which simply set out the procedure by which appointed counsel should support a request for attorney fees. It had nothing to do with recoupment of those fees or other costs. The court found that when the pre-and post-1981 versions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.665 were compared, the only substantive change was the inclusion of costs include the compensation of counsel appointed pursuant to Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ERB ordered the county to desist from refusing to bargain over the union's proposals. The county argued that the subjects of the proposals, layoff, recall, discipline, discharge, and grievance procedures, were covered by the County Civil Service Act (CCS), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 241.020 et seq., and so it was not required to bargain about them under the Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.650 et seq. The court affirmed. There was an apparent conflict between PECBA and the CCS. PECBA required the county to bargain as to employment relations. The CCS authorized amendment of the system by methods including submission to the electorate. The county's authority regarding conditions of employment was subject to PECBA. To harmonize the laws as suggested by the county would defeat the purposes of PECBA. Moreover, the county failed to show how requiring bargaining about employment relations would thwart the purposes of the CCS. If a county civil service system adopted pursuant to the CCS covered employment relations under PECBA and about which a representative desired to bargain, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 241.002(1) was inapplicable and the county had to bargain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a preliminary hearing, in admitting evidence of his previous conviction for first degree murder, and in sentencing him to a minimum of 30 years imprisonment. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a preliminary hearing because the charging process was applied the same as it was in other counties. The court further found that defendant's prior conviction for first degree murder was properly admitted because the prior conviction was an element of the crime of aggravated murder under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(1)(c), the statute under which defendant was charged. The evidence of the prior crime was not only relevant, it was material to proof of the crime. Although the prejudicial impact on defendant of having the jurors know that he had previously committed first degree murder was strong, defendant could have avoided that problem by stipulating to the prior conviction pursuant to Or.

Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to receive public assistance, the mother named the putative father as the father of her child. In the State's paternity action, the putative father denied paternity. He was represented by a legal aid attorney and, in deposition testimony, expressed his willingness to submit to blood group tests, but stated that he was unable to pay for the tests because he was indigent and unemployed.Thereafter, the parties signed a stipulation, which was signed by the trial court and which stated that the putative father agreed to submit to blood testing and that he recognized an obligation to pay for such testing. Trial was delayed so that the putative father was able to save money for the testing. About three months later, the State moved for determination of paternity without the blood tests and claimed that the putative father's inability to pay for the tests was equivalent to a refusal under &sect; 109.252. The court held that summary determination of paternity against the putative father denied him due process of law. The court further noted that although he initially agreed to pay for the tests, he failed to comply with the agreement because he was indigent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that evidence was illegally seized through his coerced consent, that incriminating statements he made after his arrest were the fruit of the illegal search and made under the influence of narcotics, and that &sect; 161.610 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant while a fugitive from the State of California robbed a tavern at gunpoint. The police obtained a warrant for defendant's arrest based upon his fugitive status. While serving the warrant at defendant's residence, police officers gave defendant Miranda warnings and sought his consent to search the residence for the gun and money. After the officers informed defendant that they would obtain a warrant and tear the house apart to find the gun and the money, defendant showed the police where the money and the gun were hidden. Defendant then admitted to the robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant was not coerced and that no search occurred because defendant showed the officers where the evidence was hidden. Defendant's statements were admissible where they were voluntary despite his narcotic use. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610, which established mandatory minimum sentences, did not violate the separation of powers provisions of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and did not deprive defendant of his right to a jury trial where he waived a jury and stipulated that he used a gun in the robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant refused to answer questions as a witness in his father's trial for murder, claiming his right against self-incrimination, despite an order under ORS 136.617 that he testify and a grant of use and derivative use immunity under ORS 136.619. The trial court found him in contempt and sentenced him to jail. Defendant argued on appeal, inter alia, that the immunity he received was inadequate under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that because the legislature intended to provide immunity sufficiently extensive to overcome the Fifth Amendment right not to be a witness against oneself, it construed ORS 136.619 to prohibit the use of the immunized testimony or its fruits against the witness in any criminal proceeding or prosecution. The corut held, therefore, that the grant of immunity was sufficient to overcome the privilege not to answer. The court further held that the order directing defendant to testify was sufficiently specific to inform him of what was required. The court finally held that it was proper for an adult court to find defendant, a juvenile, in contempt for refusing to testify in an adult proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had reported that his property had been stolen, he filed an insurance claim thereon, and he then collected $ 1,000 from the insurance company. Subsequently, the company learned that defendant had disposed of the property himself. The State indicted defendant for theft. Defendant executed a civil compromise agreement with the company and a promissory note agreeing to re-pay the company in monthly installments. The costs of prosecution and court-appointed counsel in the theft case were $ 432. The trial court ordered defendant to pay attorney fees and costs totaling $ 200 in monthly installments and thereupon dismissed the indictment. The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should not have dismissed the indictment unless defendant had first paid the full sum of $ 432. In affirming the dismissal, the court noted that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.705(1) recited that a court was to require the payment of costs and expenses incurred before it dismissed an indictment. If the trial court could not dismiss the indictment until defendant paid in full, dismissal could be substantially delayed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for running a stop sign. Before stopping him, the officer who was following him called for a cover unit because he saw defendant's head bobbing up and down in the car. The officer testified that defendant was very nervous during the stop and looked like he was trying to hide something in a plastic baggie. After defendant exited the car, the officer seized a plastic baggie containing marijuana from defendant's hand and a flowered cigarette purse and a leather change purse that he found in a brown paper bag on the front passenger seat of defendant's car. Another officer, who arrived as back-up, found a gun in a lidless container under some clothing on the back seat. The court held that the warrantless search required probable cause separate from the stop and that the trial court correctly refused to suppress the items found during the warrantless search. Specifically, the court held that, after finding the powder in the plastic bag in defendant's hand, the officers had probable cause to believe that there was more contraband in the car. The court further held that defendant's arrest for drug possession was a sufficient basis for the further search of the car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's voters authorized a bond issue to build a water system for the city designed to meet the growth needs of the community and to remove it from dependence on another city for treated water. After the switchover to the new water system, the city council approved the ordinance, which established new rates and charges for water service. Multi-family units were charged the same base capacity charge as single family structures. Plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance discriminated against multi-family units because multi-family units used less water than single family units. The city claimed that the base capacity charge was designed to treat all residential users equally with regard to the fixed costs for the availability of the system. Upon review, the court found that its review of the city's ordinance was limited to the minimum security test because it related to local economics. The court observed that the ordinance accomplished equality among residential users for the fixed costs of the new water system. Treating the residential users equally with respect to fixed charges had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant demurred to the indictment, asserting that the definition of a &quot;dependent person&quot; contained in the statute was so broad that a person could be indicted under &sect; 163.205 for the assault of a clergyman or of a person receiving social security benefits. Consequently, defendant argued, the statute was unconstitutionally vague under both the state and the federal constitutions. On appeal, the court held that the right to challenge a criminal statute on vagueness grounds, however, was limited. Defendant did not argue that he was unable to determine from reading &sect; 163.205 that his conduct of beating and choking a 10-month old child was prohibited. The court determined that defendant's conduct was unquestionably within &sect; 163.205's prohibition, thus he could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied to him on the ground of vagueness. The court also held that assuming that admission of testimony describing defendant's out-of-court admission to a police officer that he had committed a previous sexual assault on the child was error, it did not require reversal. Furthermore, the record indicated that the judge did not consider it.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138.510 to 138.680.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed habeas corpus petitions alleging that certain irregularities in the selection of members and officers of the grand juries that indicted them rendered the indictments defective so that their convictions must be vacated. The trial court appointed the same attorney to represent all petitioners and then, on its own motion, consolidated the petitions into three cases. On the state's motion, it then dismissed all the petitions. On appeal, petitioners attacked the consolidation of the separate petitions into three cases. The court found consolidation was governed by Or. R. Civ. P. 53A, which permitted consolidation only on the motion of a party. Thus, the trial court did not have the authority to consolidate the cases. However, the court held that the trial court's error was harmless. The court also determined that a challenge to the lawfulness of the composition of the grand jury was a challenge to the proceedings on which the conviction was based; it was thus appropriately brought under post-conviction relief, which superseded habeas corpus. The court held that post-conviction relief was not an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court, Harney County (Oregon), which convicted defendant of first degree theft. Defendant specifically challenged that part of his sentence that ordered him to pay interest on the unpaid balance of the restitution ordered by the trial court, which was to commence on execution of the restitution order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a court's sentencing authority existed solely by statutory grants of power and that there was no statutory authority to impose interest as part of an order to pay restitution. The court held that the order to pay interest was proper only if interest would be recoverable as special damages in a civil action in conversion based on the same facts that gave rise to the case. Such interest represented the loss of the use of the money, and was proper from the time of the offense until judgment was entered. Interest after the entry of a final judgment or decree was an appendage to a judgment, not special damages authorized under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82.010(3); however, a restitution order was not a final judgment or decree subject to &sect; 82.010(3). The court held that the interest on defendant's restitution order was not special damage but was to commence on execution of the order. In the absence of an agreement to pay, interest was required to be expressly authorized by statute; there was neither an agreement nor a statute authorizing the imposition of interest. Therefore, the interest ordered to commence on the execution of the restitution order was not authorized.</SPAN></P>

The court allowed the petition. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(c) was severable, that caselaw had not invalidated the entire disorderly conduct statute, and that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(a) was valid. The court noted that although a statute could have been overbroad and on its face violative of Or. Const. art.

That claim was raised for the first time on appeal, and the court declined to consider it. Defendant next claimed that the facts stated did not constitute an offense, under Or. Rev.

Defendant next claimed that the complaint failed to state an offense because no culpable mental state was alleged. Under Or. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.155(1). Defendant challenged the complaint under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, which guaranteed privileges and immunities, and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with racial intimidation in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.155(1). Defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that it violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it denied equal protection of the laws by granting greater protection to a victim who was assaulted because of his race, color, or national origin than to another person who was assaulted for some other reason. The trial court sustained the demurrer, and the state appealed. The court reversed and remanded the case for trial.  Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.155 did not offer more protection to any class of victims. The enhancement of the penalty in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.155 bore a rational relationship to the legitimate legislative purpose of preventing assaults on people based on their color or race, and thus it was constitutionally permissible to punish otherwise criminal conduct more severely when it was motivated by racial or ethnic hatred than by individual animosity. The court rejected defendant's argument that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.155 violated his free speech rights under Or. Const. art.

The prosecution prevailed. The four year old victim's statements were properly admitted against defendant, but not as excited utterances under Or. Evid.

Code 803(24). Defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal was rightly denied because the evidence, viewed most favorably to the prosecution, was sufficient to permit any rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty of the several offenses charged. The trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to a mandatory minimum of seven years imprisonment. To do so was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to the gravity of defendant's offenses.</SPAN></P>

Legislation directed against obscene or abusive speech was not enacted until sometime after the adoption of the Oregon Constitution in 1859. The court therefore determined that obscene or abusive language spoken with intent to annoy or alarm was not an historical exception that was well established when the first American guarantees of freedom of expression were adopted and that the guarantees then or in 1859 demonstrably were not intended to reach.</SPAN></P>

The former judge had voluntarily resigned to become a United States District Court judge. She made the contributions to the Judges' Retirement Fund, as was then required by ORS 1.310 to 1.390 (Oregon).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under ORS 1.330 (Oregon), a judge who served for not less than six years or one full judicial term could be eligible for benefits equivalent to retirement pay in the event of physical or mental incapacity. The former judge was a state judge for less than 12 years or two full terms and was not incapacitated. The statutes specified no other circumstances under which payments could be made from the fund to a judge. However, ORS 1.340(4) (Oregon) provided that under specified circumstances pensions were payable from the fund to the surviving spouse of a judge who was not eligible for retirement pay at the time of death. The former judge contended that, because she was not entitled to retirement pay or other benefits from the fund, she was entitled to recover the contributions she made to it. She argued that the statutes should be construed to allow her recovery of the contributions and that, if they could not be so construed, they were unconstitutional. The court on appeal held that she had no statutory right to recover her contributions to the fund. Furthermore, the holding of the money was not an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court, Polk County (Oregon) on two counts of manslaughter in the second degree and one count of third degree assault. On appeal, the issues included whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of the alcohol content of his blood derived from blood samples taken on the night of an auto accident in which two people died and a third was injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On request of a deputy sheriff from the county where the accident occurred, the samples were taken by a medical technician at a hospital located in another county. On appeal, the court held that the deputy had probable cause to believe that defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicants and probable cause to believe that the blood samples would reveal evidence of alcohol consumption. The warrantless seizure of the samples was dictated by the practical necessity to seize the evidence before it dissipated. There was no merit to defendant's argument that a law enforcement officer from one county had no jurisdiction to make a warrantless seizure in another county. Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 133.525(2), 133.545(2), 133.575(1) any police officer could apply for and execute a search warrant in any jurisdiction within the state. It logically followed that any officer could conduct a search without a warrant in any jurisdiction within the state. Defendant's sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a three-year minimum term did not violate either Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 or U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the OLCC's regulatory scheme, Class B licensees were allowed to serve alcohol to members and their guests, but not to members of the general public. As an exception to that rule, the OLCC promulgated Rule 845-08-045, which allowed the Class B licensees to host and to sell alcohol to nonmembers in connection with a function that no Class A licensee in the area was willing or able to accommodate. Under said rule, the Class B licensees were required to contact all Class A licensees within a 10 mile radius of its location and obtain their consent. The Class B licensees challenged the rule. The court held that the rule was invalid. The rule constituted an invalid delegation of governmental authority to private individuals because it failed to provide procedural safeguards to protect against the unaccountable exercise of government power. Given the competitive postures of the two classes, there was a substantial risk that the Class A licensees' decisions would have been colored by self-interest. Moreover, a Class B licensee was forced to confront potentially arbitrary and unresponsive exercise of governmental authority.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners sought review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), specifically Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.482, claiming that the action was inconsistent with Oregon's Statewide Planning Goals (Goals) listed under Or. Admin. R. ch. 660.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, the Division found that granting a permit to remove gravel from the river bank to the applicant was not inconsistent with the Goals and was not inconsistent with the protection, conservation, and best use of the water and gravel resources and of the fishery and other biological resources. The Division claimed that the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the appeal under 1979 Or. Laws 772, &sect;&sect; 4-6, as amended by 1981 Or. Laws 748, &sect; 4(1). The court held that petitioners were entitled to appeal the decision under the APA, specifically Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 183.480 and 183.482, even though the action was a land use decision. However, the court held that the aspects of the decision in which the Division was required to apply the Goals under Or. Rev.

Additionally, the court held that petitioners did not demonstrate why the record did not support the finding that the removal of gravel from the river was not inconsistent with any use of the river and that the Division did not have to articulate what was the &quot;best use&quot; of the resource under Or.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged that defendant engaged in sexual conduct in a live public show in a bar, wearing only a &quot;G-string,&quot; by touching his genitals, pubic area, and buttocks against female spectators and letting them touch him, in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification. The court reversed his conviction, finding that the trial court should have sustained defendant's demurrer to the indictment because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062 was overbroad and therefore violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062 prohibited expression that was protected by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, which prohibited the passage of any law restraining the free expression of opinion or restricting the right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever. It was acceptable in stage performances for one performer to touch the buttocks, breasts, or genitals of another performer. The person touched might respond so that a reasonable person in the audience would perceive that the performer touched was sexually stimulated or gratified. Because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062 made such touching criminal, it was overbroad.</SPAN></P>

In reversing and remanding, the court held that denying defendant the opportunity of a rehabilitation program because of his indigency violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with disorderly conduct under &sect; 166.025(1)(a). The lower court sustained defendants' demurrers to the complaints charging them with disorderly conduct. The state challenged the lower court judgment as it held that &sect; 166.025(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court reversed the lower court judgment and remanded for trial because it found that the words &quot;fighting&quot; and &quot;violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior&quot; as used in &sect; 166.025(1)(a) did not encompass constitutionally protected speech but rather physical acts of aggression. In prohibiting specific physical acts, &sect; 166.025(1)(a) did not run afoul of Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. The court concluded that &sect; 166.025(1)(a) made it unlawful only to use physical force or physical conduct that was immediately likely to produce the use of force and was intended to create a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm and was not void for vagueness on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal of two cases, defendant appealed his convictions on three counts of possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992(4), and one count of delivery of a controlled substance, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In respect to two of the possession counts, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence discovered when police officers were executing a warrant for his arrest at his residence. Officers had arrived at defendant's residence to execute the warrant. Two officers walked up to the front door. The officers saw a small boy and a man. The man, defendant, answered the door and acknowledged his identity. An officer handed defendant a copy of the warrant of arrest. The officers entered the house without requesting defendant's consent. The officers asked if there was anyone else in the house to care for the boy. Defendant told the officers that no one else was in the house. The boy, however, led the officer to his father who was in the house. The officers then searched the rest of the house and found drugs and paraphernalia in an upstairs room. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court stated that once the boy's father was located, there was no &quot;practical necessity&quot; to search the rest of the house. Thus, the evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was an employer, who suffered injuries due to a defective condition in an overhead bridge crane. The victim sued the crane's manufacture, and the trial court dismissed the suit as being time barred under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.905(1) because the suit was not brought within eight years from the date the crane was purchased. The victim appealed, arguing that the statute denied him access to the courts. The court held that &sect; 30.905(1) served legitimate public purposes by preventing claims where evidence could be unreliable and unavailable due to lapse of time, by allowing persons to plan their affairs free from the burden of protracted and unknown potential liability, and to stabilize product liability insurance rates. The court stated that given these purposes, the statute did not unconstitutionally deny the victim access to the courts. The court also ruled that the statute did not deny the victim equal protection because it satisfied the rational basis test, since a statute of ultimate repose would have a stabilizing effect on the insurance situation. Finally, the court concluded that &sect; 30.905(1) did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which convicted defendant of attempted murder, first degree assault, and first degree robbery. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying defendant's pretrial motion requesting access to the county courthouse law library and in denying defendant's motion to suppress items seized during a search of a hotel room that defendant shared with his girlfriend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in classifying defendant as a dangerous offender. On appeal, the court found no reversible error. First, defendant was not denied access to the law library because defendant's legal advisor, an attorney, was expressly authorized to supply defendant with materials from that library. Second, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because defendant's girlfriend, who rented the hotel room herself, gave oral and written consent sufficient to authorize the warrantless search. Third, defendant was properly classified as a dangerous offender under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.725, and the psychiatric report required in making that determination under &sect; 161.735(3) was not unconstitutional, because defendant perpetrated a violent attack on his victim, had a history of violent criminal behavior, and because precedent established that the fact that a penal statute was based on a prediction of future dangerousness did not render the statute violative of the Due Process Clause. Finally, the trial court erred in imposing a minimum mandatory sentence pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610; thus, the judgment was modified by deleting that sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the trial court by deleting the minimum mandatory sentence, and, as modified, affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builders' entered agreements for the sale of individual condominium units that contained express warranties concerning the general and limited common elements of the condominium complex. The association, as the representative of the condominium unit owners, brought an action against the builders alleging breach of warranty and seeking damages based upon the express warranties, and also alleging negligence in the construction of the common elements of the complex. The trial court granted the builders' motion to dismiss the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that: 1) the association, organized as a non-profit corporation, had the capacity to sue pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 61.061(2), and was the real party in interest; 2) the association had the authority to incur an obligation for defendants' legal fees if the builders prevailed in the litigation; 3) although the builders' contract might be indirectly impaired in an action by the association by modifying the remedy available to the builder, such modification would not impair the value of the contracts by destroying any meaningful remedy; therefore 4) federal or state constitutions were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One school district filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and a petition for alternative writ of mandamus, seeking a declaration that it was entitled to a pro-rata share of interest earned on the mineral revenues for fiscal year 1980-81 and subsequent years. Th school district amended its complaint to include a petition for a writ of review. All other taxing districts in the county were named as opposite parties in the petition. The court concluded that the acts of the county commissioners were ministerial acts. Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that declaratory relief was the proper remedy. A writ of review was not available to plaintiffs. The trial court correctly concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.030, which pertained to writs of review, did not apply. The court determined that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 275.275 provided that the county should receive a minimum of 10 percent of the &quot;total&quot; proceeds as administrative costs. The interest earned on the principal received from the mineral leases was a component of the &quot;total proceeds.&quot; Accordingly, the county was entitled to 10 percent of the principal and interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born to an unwed mother who stated in an affidavit that she met and had sexual relations with the father only once, that she had no further contact with him since, and that his whereabouts were unknown.

CSD consented to the adoption and recommended to the trial court that the adoption be allowed. The adoptive parent's petition to adopt was dismissed following the trial court's denial of CSD's motion to dispense with notice of the adoption to the father pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.096(2). The court reversed the dismissal of the petition and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.096(2), which did not require notice of the adoption proceedings be given to the father under the circumstances, satisfied the father's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The court stated that because the father had not come forward to initiate a parent-child relationship, his liberty interest was insufficient to justify the procedures necessary to apprise him of the adoption proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that &sect; 163.115 contravened the due process provisions of both the United States and Oregon Constitutions by placing the burden on defendant of proving the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant arrived at his ex-wife's house armed with a rifle and a pistol.

Defendant fired back and killed the victim. Defendant was transported to the hospital. He was visited several times by police while hospitalized, but was not charged until a week after his release. The indictment charged defendant with aggravated murder, murder, and burglary. At trial, he was convicted only of murder and he appealed. The court held that the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance did not serve to negate any of the facts the State was required to prove in order to convict. The court held that the evidence supported the trial judge's findings that defendant was not in custody or deprived of his freedom of action in a significant way for purposes of mandating Miranda warnings. The court concluded that the challenged statements were given to the police in an investigatory and not a custodial setting. Miranda warnings were not required.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's arguments. It was bound by the trial court's finding that the prosecutor's actions did not affect the witnesses' testimony. Without showing some effect on the testimony, the court concluded that defendant could not establish a violation of the Compulsory Process or Due Process Clauses. It also concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a witness's testimony regarding a discussion with defendant in which defendant told him to &quot;get rid of&quot; the state's witness in the municipal court trial.

The court held Or. Admin. R. 436-69-201(2), which dealt with the frequency and extent of medical treatment was valid where the rule did not limit treatment but merely required that if the treatment exceeded the prescribed number of visits, the physician needed to submit a report justifying further treatment.

R. 436-69-301(3), which allowed persons of well-recognized religions the right to refuse rehabilitative treatments was unconstitutional as violative of freedom of religion where the department failed to show the necessity for drawing the suspect distinction between beliefs. The court determined Admin. R. 436-69-501 was invalid because it in effect punished a claimant by refusing to pay duly incurred medical bills. The court concluded Or. Admin R. 436-69-801 invalidly provided an additional penalty when one had already been authorized by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Reversing defendant's conviction on the concealed weapon count, the court held that because a switchblade was a type of pocket knife and it was not illegal under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240 to carry a concealed pocket knife, it was not illegal under that statute to carry a concealed switchblade. The court found that because defendant framed his appeal in the alternative, the effect of arguing in the alternative was to admit that a challenge to the conviction on the possession count could only succeed if the appeal of the concealed weapon count failed. The court ruled that the appeal on the concealed weapon count did not fail, and thus affirmed defendant's conviction for possessing a stabbing weapon under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.510.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found that because the longshoreman's injury took place on the port's dock instead of on navigable waters of the United States, the port was immune from tort liability under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a) left the port immune from the longshoreman's claim because he had received worker's compensation benefits under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq. The circuit court reasoned that state law, rather than federal maritime law, applied to the claim because the longshoreman was on a ladder that was permanently affixed to the port's dock when he was injured. The court agreed, holding that: (1) because the ladder was not an appurtenance to the ship like a gangplank, the fact that the longshoreman was on the ladder instead of on the dock itself did not trigger maritime jurisdiction; (2) the fact that the injury was covered by the LHWCA did not mean that federal maritime law applied; (3) the longshoreman's claim that the port waived its immunity by procuring liability insurance failed because he provided no evidence of such insurance in his opposition to the port's summary judgment motion; and (4) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a) did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 or the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was admitted to a state hospital at age nine. He was later accused of murdering a fellow patient. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to the state hospital for life or until he became sane or was otherwise released. Under 1977 Or. Laws ch. 380, &sect; 22 (Act), jurisdiction for such commitments of patients was transferred from the circuit court to the Psychiatric Security Review Board (PSRB). The patient challenged the PSRB's order that continued its jurisdiction over him and continued his commitment. The court affirmed, determining that the Act was not ex post facto as applied to the patient where he failed to show that the transfer of jurisdiction to the PSRB increased his penalty, imposed upon him a greater burden of proof, or otherwise deprived him of any due process rights. The Act did not violate the principal of separation of powers under Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 because delegation of adjudicatory powers to administrative agencies was valid if judicial review was provided at some stage of the proceeding.

Dist., Or., Ordinance No. 92 (ordinance), which imposed an excise tax on an individual's net earnings from self-employment, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was self-employed. He filed an action for declaratory relief, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it imposed a tax on his net earnings from self-employment and on no other class of individuals or businesses. The district, a municipal corporation, was authorized to levy an income tax on the earnings of all individuals and business in the district, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. 267.370. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to that authority. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional and granted the district's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that Or. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, which provided that all taxes were to be levied uniformly, did not apply to the taxes imposed by the district, as it was a municipal corporation, and &sect; 1 applied only to taxes that operated throughout the State. The court further held that a governmental authority was permitted to single out a subterritory for separate treatment so long as the classification rested on &quot;genuine differences.&quot; The court concluded that the district's decision to tax only income derived from self-employment was based on genuine difference, thus, the ordinance was valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment for the newspaper and its reporters, finding that the bank and its president, as private individuals, could not recover because they failed to allege gross negligence. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the bank and its president should have been allowed to amend their complaint to allege negligence, which was the proper level of culpability that a private individual had to prove against a &quot;media defendant&quot; to recover for libel. Thus, in order to recover, the bank and its president merely had to prove the common law elements of libel and that the newspaper and its reporters were at least negligent in failing to ascertain whether the defamatory publication was true or false.

An extension service agent assessed the farmer's damages. The operator's insurance adjuster inspected the damage, assured the farmer that the claim was legitimate, that he would take care of it and not to worry about it, and confirmed in writing that the claim was being processed. In the farmer's action for loss of profits, the trial court granted summary judgment to the operator because the farmer failed to report the loss to the state under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 634.172(1). On appeal, the court reversed, finding questions of fact as to whether the operator was estopped from relying on failure to file the report in denying the farmer's claim. The court ruled that the farmer had not substantially complied with the statute because he made no report to the state or the operator and that informing the operator and extension agent was insufficient. The court concluded the adjuster's assurances, while not telling the farmer that recovery required a state report, raised questions as to whether the statements could have been interpreted as a promise to settle the claim and pay the damage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judgment debtor challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Linn County (Oregon), in favor of appellee county. The judgment debtor was plaintiff in a contracts case which was resolved in favor of the judgment creditor. The judgment debtor alleged that the county clerk had negligently failed to mail notice of entry of judgment until after expiration of the appeals period, thereby precluding the judgment debtor from appealing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment debtor contended that notice of entry had not been mailed as required by former ORS 18.030, now ORCP 70B(1). The debtor presented its attorney's affidavit stating that had the clerk mailed notice, an appeal would have been filed, judgment would have been reversed, and the debtor had sustained damages as a result. The trial court concluded that the clerk was negligent, was not immune, that the debtor was not contributorily negligent, but that the debtor was collaterally estopped from contending that the issues in the prior litigation would have been resolved differently. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had improperly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The court compared the case to one of legal malpractice, where as an element of recovery, the debtor was required to prove that had the clerk complied with the statute, the outcome would have been favorable. The first issue for the trial court was to determine from the record, as though a direct appeal, whether the debtor would have prevailed on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Accident Prevention Division (Oregon) sought review of an order of the Workers' Compensation Board (Oregon), which held that it was improper to issue a citation to an employer for a &quot;repeat violation&quot; of an occupational safety standard while the citation for the prior violation was being contested by the employer and had not yet been upheld by a final order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Accident Prevention Division issued a citation to an employer after inspecting its worksite. The employer contested the citation and, after another inspection of the same worksite, the employer received another citation. Following a hearing, a referee concluded that the repeat violation citation was improper. On appeal, the court noted that referee's decision effectively invalidated Or. Admin. R. 436-46-160(3), which authorized the issuance of repeat violation citations. The court determined that the basic policy of providing employers with incentives to comply with the safety requirements of the Oregon Safe Employment Act, ORS 654.001 to 654.295 (Oregon), was intrinsic to the statutory scheme of enforcement of the Act, that the rule promoted that policy by discouraging employers from avoiding the incentive provided by the enhanced penalties for repeat violations by contesting the prior citation, and that the rule was consistent with both the language and the policy of the Act. The court further determined that the employer was given an adequate opportunity for a hearing and, thus, there was no violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The AFSD's decision to terminate or reduce the special diet allowances received by the recipients was based upon a temporary rule that amended Admin.

The court held that the retroactive application of the permanent rule was unreasonable in its prejudice to the recipients. Therefore, the court reversed that part of the AFSD's final order that terminated or reduced the allowances as of the effect date of the temporary rule. However, the court affirmed the termination of the allowances as of the effective date of the permanent rule. The court also remanded for recalculation of the amount of the special diet allowance to one recipient, finding that the permanent rule was invalid to the extent that it permitted utilization of food stamp allotments in determining the benefit level. The court concluded that the utilization of food stamp allotments was contrary to the purposes of 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2017(b) of the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2011 et seq., and Or. Rev.

Laws ch. 772, &sect; 4(7) (1979), as amended by Or. Laws ch. 748, &sect; 35 (1981), but the Board did not hold an evidentiary hearing as provided for therein, and the citizens did not assign such failure as error before the court; and (5) the Board's order of dismissal was proper because the notice of intent to appeal was, on its face, untimely, and no proper evidence was in the record even to create a question as to the citizens' right to appeal later than the statutes authorized.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was tried for unlawful possession on a dangerous weapon in violation of ORS 166.220, and for first-degree sodomy in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.405.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before defendant's trial, he moved to disqualify the trial judge. Although defendant testified that he had heard from other attorneys and from written sources that this judge was prejudiced against a certain class of criminal defendants of which he was a member. His motion for change of judge was nonetheless denied, and he was convicted of the weapons charge. The conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial. The court held that defendant's showing satisfied the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.260 for a change of judge. While defendant's good faith could be challenged, the burden of good faith was satisfied by a showing that he received information that, if true, would reasonably lead him to fear the judge's prejudice. The court noted that, as a matter of public policy, it was better to substitute judges than make defendants prove the judge's prejudice. The court also held that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that the carrying of a dangerous weapon was sufficient evidence of guilt, instead of that it was presumptive evidence of guilt. The instruction violated Or. Evid. Code 309 as regarded presumptions in jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers bought a complex to use for recreational activities. The county's planning commission determined that the intended use was permitted under the then-existing zoning ordinance. The purchaser began development.

The county's commission determined that the purchasers had a vested right to continue their nonconforming use. The neighbors appealed the county's resolution to LUBA, which dismissed the appeal because the circuit court had jurisdiction. The neighbors did not appeal LUBA's decision but filed a complaint in the circuit court, which dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that, under 1979 Or. Laws 772, &sect; 4(1), LUBA was the only forum in which the neighbors could have contested the county's determination. Furthermore, there was no question that the decision was final and was made by a local government within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.015. Therefore, the neighbors failed to pursue their remedy, which was to appeal to the Court of Appeals of Oregon from the LUBA decision. That they failed to do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chief Justice argued that his labor relations with employes of the Judicial Department were not subject to the PECBA because his authority under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a former saleswomen in a department store, filed suit against her employer for outrageous conduct, defamation, and breach of contract, all stemming from an interview in which she was questioned by store security personnel about a suspected theft. On appeal from a verdict for the employee, the court affirmed in part, noting that the employer's assignments of error on the defamation and wage claims were without merit. Further, the court noted that the jury could find that the employee was threatened with criminal prosecution if she did not sign a confession and could infer that the security officers did not reasonably believe that sufficient evidence existed to charge her with theft. If so, the jury could determine that such conduct, combined with other aspects of the interrogation, exceeded the bounds of socially tolerable employer practices. There was, thus, sufficient evidence to submit the outrageous conduct claim to the jury. However, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the outrageous conduct claim when the jury instruction encompassed both actionable and non-actionable conduct and authorized a verdict for conduct that was socially acceptable.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect;&sect; 1, 3, 9, 33, and the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The challenge was to the failure to fund any surgical procedure that a physician determined to be medically necessary, but not life-threatening, if it involved an abortion. The court held that the rule was invalid under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court concluded that there was a class of women who were denied a privilege available to other class members on equal terms. The court applied a balancing test which weighed the detriment to the affected class members against the state's justification for the disparate treatment. The rule denied benefits for pregnancy-related medically necessary services that involved abortion solely on that ground. The court concluded that the state's fiscal interest in limiting funding for abortions and it interest in protecting potential life did not outweigh the woman's interest in her health.</SPAN></P>

The trial court later granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The delay in the case was neither unreasonable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.747 nor unconstitutional. The delay before defendant's motion to dismiss was just over two and one half years. Slightly over a year of this period was due to the State's appeal when the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence. Defendant alleged no bad faith on the part of the State in seeking the appeal. Defendant had to assume some responsibility for the delay attributable to the trial court's failure to reconsider the motion to suppress in time for the new trial date. Defendant made her first motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial two weeks before her trial date, over two years after the indictment. Defendant could have asserted her right much earlier than that. Further, defendant alleged no specific prejudice but relied on the length of the delay.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a minimum term imposed under Or. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110(1) for conviction of a Class A felony. The court noted that the length of the minimum term was limited by the sentence imposed and not by the maximum indeterminate term provided for the underlying felony. As defendant was convicted of three Class A felonies, the trial court was authorized to impose a maximum 30-year sentence on each conviction. The 15-year minimum terms were expressly authorized by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110(1). The court also denied the claim that the 15-year minimum terms were unconstitutional because they were disproportionate to the 10-year minimum term allowable for the completed act of murder. A sentence of up to 15 years for murder was permissible under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 110.

Defendant alleged that a 1978 amendment to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(5), which required a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence for murder, repealed, by implication, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110(1) as applied to murder, and that &sect; 144.110(1) was not revived by the repeal of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(5).</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 163.115(5) to provide for a 25 year minimum sentence for a murder conviction. The statute was held unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's sentence and held as follows: (1) there is not such repugnance between the statutes that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110(1) was repealed by implication because &sect; 144.110(1) applied to all felony cases and allowed, but did not require, a judge to impose a minimum term of up to one-half of the sentence imposed; (2) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(5), as amended, applied only to murder and on its face purported neither to be a substitute for Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110(1) nor to preclude the simultaneous validity of both statutes; (3) when Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(5), the more specific statute, was found unconstitutional,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110(1) was no longer controlled by it and applied by its terms to &quot;any felony,&quot; including murder; and (4) the 1981 legislature did not intend that there be no minimum term for murder following the repeal of the 1978 measure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Deschutes County (Oregon), which dismissed their appeal from an order of respondent county board of commissioners, establishing a way of necessity across the owners' land and fixing the amount of compensation therefor. The circuit court dismissed the appeal on the ground the owners should have petitioned the circuit court for a writ of review under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.010 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners appealed to the circuit court pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 376.175(4), which provided that any party to the action for a way of necessity could contest the order of the county governing body in an appeal filed with the circuit court. The board claimed that review of its order was exclusively by writ of review. It relied on Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 203.113, which provided that the decisions of a county court made in the transaction of county business could be reviewed only as provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 34.010 to 34.100, and on Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.020, which provided that any party to any proceeding before any inferior court, officer, or tribunal could have the decision thereof reviewed for errors, only as provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 34.010 to 34.100. The court reversed the circuit court. State laws gave separate treatment to proceedings respecting ways of necessity. Further, since 1919, a landowner could contest an order of a county board, establishing a way of necessity, by appeal to the circuit court. Thus, it held that, as provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 376.175(4), an order of the board in a proceeding to establish a way of necessity could be appealed to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant applied for a loan for his corporation from a bank and entered into a security agreement on the corporation's behalf, in which he stated that it owned seven vehicles.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 165.615 and 165.620, and the legislative history showed that there was no intent to change the former law; (2) the provisions of the former law clearly showed, in the context of an extension of credit, the term &quot;financial statement&quot; included any written statement purporting to describe a corporation's financial condition or ability to pay and on which the declarant intended the lender to rely; (3) the security agreement was a financial statement, within the meaning of the law, because it described the corporation's ability to pay, and the bank relied on it; and (4) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.100 was not unconstitutionally because it fairly informed persons of common intelligence, courts, or juries, of what types of statements were included in the term &quot;financial statements.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought review of a Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) order, which dismissed their appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners had challenged an order of respondent, the Wasco County Court, which granted a petition to incorporate the City of Rajneeshpuram, fixing boundaries of the proposed city and setting a date for a special election on the matter of incorporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">LUBA held that the county court's order was not a &quot;land use decision&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.015(10) and was therefore not subject to LUBA review. Petitioners asserted that it was a land use decision. The court reversed the dismissal, holding that the county's decision to authorize an incorporation election was a land use decision subject to LUBA review. Land use decisions subject to LUBA review included local planning activities that would have a significant impact on present or future land use. The standard meant that if the completed process would have a significant impact, the decision to implement the process was reviewable by LUBA. The implementation of the county's decision entailed the holding of an election to incorporate, to set urban boundaries, and to effect a transition from rural to urban land use. Therefore, it would have a significant impact if, as appeared reasonably likely, the voters did elect to incorporate. If they did so, land that could not have been used for urban use before would be available for future urban use.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he argued that after he had requested appointed counsel at arraignment, the police could not initiate any interrogation of him. The court held that the challenged statements were admissible. Defendant demurred to the felony murder indictment on the ground that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(1)(b) was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling the demurrer because there was not such a disparity in culpability between felony murder and intentional murder that the state or federal constitutions required different levels of punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) for carrying a loaded firearm on the ground that Portland, Or., Ordinance No. 138210, &sect; 14.32.010, the ordinance under which he was convicted, violated Or. Const. art I, &sect; 27, which related to the right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city police officer noticed defendant's car traveling at a high rate of speed without headlights. The officer stopped the car and as he approached it, he observed what appeared to be a handgun on the seat and found it was loaded after he picked it up. Defendant was arrested and convicted. Defendant contended that Portland, Or., Ordinance No. 138210, &sect; 14.32.010 was unconstitutional and relied upon case law in which the possession of billy clubs was found to be constitutionally protected. In affirming the convictions, the court held that the statute challenged in the case law, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.510(1) and the ordinance were fundamentally different. The statute's proscription of the mere possession of certain weapons made it unconstitutional. The ordinance, however, did not proscribe mere possession of even a loaded firearm, but made criminal possession of a loaded gun in a public place. Such an encroachment on a constitutional right was permissible when the unrestricted exercise of the right posed a clear threat to the interests and welfare of the public in general. The means chosen by the city to protect its citizens did not unreasonably interfere with the right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school sought review of a decision from the referee of respondent employment division, which affirmed the Division's tax assessment for reimbursement of unemployment compensation paid to four of the school's former employees. The school claimed it was statutorily exempt from the Unemployment Compensation Act, Or. Rev. Stat. 657.005-657.990 and that the application of the Act was forbidden by the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division assessed taxes against the school for reimbursement of unemployment compensation paid to four of the school's former teachers. The school filed an appeal. In reversing and remanding the decision, the court held that as an independent religious school, the school was exempt from the Act because the application of it violated the Establishment Clause. The court determined that the remedy of subjecting church schools to the Act directly contradicted Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657.072(1) but also found that &sect; 657.072(1) improperly favored one organizational form of religious expression by singling out schools that were linked to established churches. The court stated that Congress intended to exempt church-operated schools from the Act and likely would expand the exemption to apply to religious schools. The court reasoned that by requiring a school to be under the control of a church with the power to determine the school's doctrine in order to be exempt under &sect; 657.072, the Act infringed on citizens' rights to develop their own beliefs and discouraged a variety of sects. The court concluded the exemption could not be conditioned on whether a religious school was linked to a church.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that he was improperly denied his Miranda warnings prior to examination by the State's psychiatrist, that jury instructions were erroneous, that his motion for a mistrial was improperly denied, and that he was denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before his trial for the murder of a 15-month-old child, defendant obtained an order authorizing an examination by a psychiatrist at public expense to determine his mental state at the time of the murder. After a second motion, he was given another examination at public expense, and he gave notice of his intent to introduce evidence at trial on the issue of criminal responsibility. The State obtained an order requiring defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination. The order provided that defendant's attorney could be present. Defendant was not read his Miranda rights by the State's psychiatrist. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that defendant knew that the results of the examination could be used in court. Thus, there was no error in the psychiatrist's examination. Because the instructions as a whole did not improperly shift the burden of proof to defendant or impermissibly comment on defendant's failure to testify, the trial court's instruction on weaker and less satisfactory evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err in ruling on defendant's motion for a mistrial, and defendant was not denied due process.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 243.672(1)(e), (g) by refusing to bargain with the union and by establishing terms and conditions of employment for the counselors at variance with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The judge challenged the ERB's order, claiming that he and the employees of the juvenile court were not subject to the Public Employe Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.650 et seq. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.604(1) did not preclude application of the PECBA to the judge and the counselors because the statutes were not inconsistent. Further, applying the bargaining and terms and conditions provisions of the PECBA to the judge and the counselors was not a separation of powers violation under Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, because the provisions did not unduly burden or interfere with judicial functions. However, the court declined to address the issue of whether the PECBA, taken as a whole, could apply to any court.</SPAN></P>

The ordinary meaning of the term &quot;gambling&quot; was the act or practice of betting, the act of playing a game and consciously risking money or other stakes on its outcome, or the act of risking something on an uncertain event. The court concluded that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because those to whom the ordinance was addressed could discern from the ordinary meaning of the term &quot;gambling&quot; what conduct the city did or did not intend to include in the prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother and her new husband, sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court, Benton County (Oregon), which ruled in favor of respondent biological father in appellants' adoption proceeding in which they contended that the father's consent was not required because he had either wilfully deserted his two minor children or wilfully neglected them without just and sufficient cause within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.324.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and biological father were divorced, and the mother was awarded custody of their minor son and unborn daughter. The mother moved to another state without providing her new address to father, but he learned of it from a third party. After the divorce the father saw the son only once and never asked to see the daughter. When the mother's new husband sought to adopt the children, the father made one child support payment. The mother and her new husband argued that the father's consent to the adoption was not required because the father had either deserted or neglected the children for more than a year. The trial court ruled in favor of the father and appellants sought review. The court noted that desertion in the context of &sect; 109.324 required proof that a parent had voluntarily foregone exercise of all parental rights. The court found that the father had deserted the daughter within the meaning of the statute. The court found further that the father had neglected the son within the meaning of the statute in failing to provide for his support, stating that the father's reliance on bad advice from counsel did not relieve him of his support obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that the trial court had granted in favor of the father. The court remanded for further proceedings so that the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, could ascertain whether the father's consent was required for the adoption of his children by the mother's new husband.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' patent contained a mineral reservation in favor of the United States. The company obtained its mineral rights through federal legislation. The trial court found that the government retained a reversionary interest in the minerals not extracted by company and that the county could neither prohibit the government from regulating its property nor enforce zoning on property in federal ownership. The owners argued that the county ordinances were constitutional. The court affirmed the judgment because the owners' complaint coupled with the company's answer, motion for summary judgment, and affidavit, did not raise any issue of material fact. The only issue properly before the trial court was a matter of law: whether the county ordinances impermissibly conflicted with federal regulations of reserved mining rights under the Stock Raising Homestead Act. The court held that the county ordinances did not supplement federal mining law. Rather, they completely prohibited a mineral claimant from conducting any surface mining on patented land. The county was unable to prohibit conduct, which Congress had specifically authorized.</SPAN></P>

After multiple requests for defendant to return to her vehicle, the police officer radioed for backup and defendant was handcuffed and cited. The court opined that even if the stop was unlawful, the police officer had authority to order defendant to return to her vehicle. The court pointed out that the statute encompassed only orders under the police officer's general authority to direct, control, or regulate traffic, so that the statute did not subject citizens to unbridled power and discretion. Defendant's vehicle and the police vehicle were stopped in a lane of traffic and constituted an impediment to normal traffic flow as long as they remained. The police officer was attempting to expedite the investigation and to clear the traffic lane. Defendant persisted in standing near the police officer and arguing with him. His numerous orders for her to return to her vehicle related to his duties to control, direct, and regulate traffic. Defendant was aware of the orders and consciously chose to disobey.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment of the District Court, Lane County (Oregon), which sustained defendant's demurrer to an indictment charging him of furnishing a photograph of a portion of the human body depicting nudity to three minors in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.065(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the state statute violated the First Amendment and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 in that the statute was an overbroad law. Pursuant to the First Amendment and the state constitutional provision, no law was to be passed restraining the free expression of opinion or restricting the right to speak freely upon any subject. The court determined that the mere depiction of nudity could not have been prohibited under the First Amendment. The court held that a state was permitted to adopt more stringent controls on communicative materials available to youths than those available to adults. However, the court found that the guidelines for judging obscenity were: (1) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would have found that the work, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest; (2) whether the work depicted, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (3) whether the work lacked serious artistic, political, or scientific value. The court held that the scope of the state statute could not have been narrowed by judicial interpretation and that it was overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assisted another man in taking boxes of marijuana from a truck and placing them in the vehicle of an undercover police officer. At trial, defendant contended that he did not know the contents of the boxes. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that proof of the unlawful delivery of a controlled substance was prima facie evidence of knowledge of the character of the substance delivered. The court noted that knowing delivery of a controlled substance was an essential element of the crime. The court found that the trial court's instruction that permitted the element of knowledge to be proven from evidence of delivery alone, which defendant admitted, without reference to the circumstances under which the parcel was possessed or delivered, was error. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff borrowers challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which dismissed their complaint against defendant lender in which they sought a decree declaring that a trust deed to their property could not have been foreclosed by advertisement and sale, certain provisions of the Oregon Trust Deed Act (Act) were unconstitutional, and the loan secured by the trust deed was not in default at the time of foreclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrowers obtained a loan from the lender. The loan was secured by a trust deed, which specified that, in the event of default, if the land was not currently used for agricultural, timber, or grazing purposes, the beneficiary could elect to foreclose by advertisement and sale. The borrowers became delinquent on their loan payments. The lender notified them of its intention to proceed with a foreclosure action if the account was not made current within 30 days. The borrowers did not bring the account current. They brought an action against the lender for declaratory relief. The lender declared a default, advertised the property for sale, and sold it. The circuit court entered judgment for the lender. The borrowers appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the lender was permitted to have foreclosed the property by advertisement and sale because the land was not used for agricultural, timber, or grazing purposes at the time the trust deed was executed. The court held that the lender adequately notified the borrowers of its intent to strictly enforce the terms of the contract, and that the lender afforded the borrowers sufficient opportunity to make up the delinquency payments.</SPAN></P>
