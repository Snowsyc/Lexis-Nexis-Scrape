<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions of Sexual Misconduct with a Minor and Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor. Appellant claimed that his statements to a social worker should have been suppressed at trial because they amounted to an involuntary confession in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V; Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 14; and his Miranda rights. The court held that the admission of appellant's statements into evidence was constitutional. The social worker was an agent of the government in the course of securing a conviction, but appellant's statements to her were voluntary. Similarly, there was no problem with the lack of Miranda warnings before appellant made his statements because appellant was not in custody (though he was subject to interrogation). Appellant testified that he knew he was &quot;free to leave&quot; the interview with the social worker. The court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient to support a finding of disorderly conduct, because defendant's loud manner of speaking disrupted a police investigation. Defendant's adjudication did not contravene Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the Marion Superior Court's (Indiana) grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant in an action challenging the constitutionality of the Legislators' Retirement System, Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a retired state legislator, brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the Indiana Legislators' Retirement System, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 2-3.5-4-1 - 2-3.5-4-10, under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant State. On appeal, the issue was whether the trial court erred in determining that the retirement system was constitutional. The statute granted unequal privileges to different members of the legislature, but the date of service classification legitimately distinguished between retired legislators and current and future legislators. This distinction represented a reasonable exercise of legislative line drawing. Plaintiff failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality and failed to negate every conceivable basis that might have supported the classification. Consequently, the trial court properly granted defendant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

V. The court found that appellee had never met his burden of proving that, at the time the ordinance was adopted, he had used his property in a manner amounting to a lawful nonconforming use. In the event that the case required further proceedings, the court noted that appellant was not precluded from adopting an amortization provision in its zoning ordinance should it choose to do so.

Const. art. 1, &sect; 16. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's convictions did not violate his right against double jeopardy, because both the robbery charge and the confinement charges contained at least one separate and distinct element; past offense evidence presented by the state was sufficient to establish that he was a habitual offender; and his sentence was proportionate to the nature of his offenses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, petitioner argued the trial court erred by upholding respondent's disciplinary policies against petitioner's challenge to the validity of those policies and against petitioner's challenge that the action violated his procedural due process rights; denying petitioner's motion for a change of venue; and granting respondent summary judgment. Petitioner also argued that the judicial review section of the Indiana Student Discipline Act (Act) was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners brought inverse condemnation action against defendants city and county to recover damages suffered after the prosecutor obtained a seizure order against the plaintiffs' property based on its use as an adult bookstore, which displayed obscene material. All parties moved for summary judgment. The denial of plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and the granting of defendants' motion for summary judgment were affirmed because collateral estoppel barred the subsequent litigation of the issue that the prosecutor was an agent of the state and acted on behalf of the state and not on behalf of defendants. Also, judicial immunity extended to the local police because they were enforcing the court-ordered seizure. Thus, judicial immunity barred liability against the police and all other actors involved in the seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant ophthalmologist for failure to advise of the type and risk and benefits of surgery, which prevented plaintiff from pursuing surgery and led to further deterioration of his eye from glaucoma and eventual removal. The trial court found that absent defendant's negligence, plaintiff had a 50 percent chance of retaining vision in his eye and awarded damages reduced by 50 percent. Plaintiff appealed the reduction of the award and defendant cross-appealed. The court reversed in part, finding that the trial court erred in reducing the award because under the increased risk of harm rule, applicable to causation, a plaintiff recovers for the harm suffered, not for the loss of the chance of recovery; and the court affirmed in part, in finding that the trial court did not err in concluding that the case was timely filed, in denying defendant's belated request for a jury trial, and in finding that plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reduction of the award was reversed and remanded because the increased risk of harm rule, applicable to causation, did not limit recovery.

The occurrence-based statute of limitations was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff pursuant to Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.

Appellee denied the applications, the trial court affirmed the denial, and appellant sought review. It argued that appellee erroneously denied the permits, that appellee was estopped from denying the application, that the denial violated due process and appellant's rights to free speech and equal protection, and that the denial was an unconstitutional taking. The court remanded for a determination of whether the signs were in residential or business zones, because if the signs were in residential zones, they would be ineligible for permits. The court further found that appellee was equitably estopped from denying the application and that the appellant failed to show that it was denied due process. The court also found that the Indiana Billboard Act, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 8-23-20-1 to -26, was constitutional because it did not distinguish between signs based on content. The court found that the taking issue was not properly before it because the billboards were still standing and a takings claim could only be made after the signs were removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee worked for defendant employer, an animal hospital. Plaintiff employee fell in a kennel and injured her arm and neck.

Subsequently, plaintiff employee sought further medical treatment for shoulder and neck pain. Defendant employer contended that plaintiff employee's condition was no longer caused by her work-related injury and denied worker's compensation coverage. Ultimately, defendant insurer provided worker's compensation benefits to plaintiff employee. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the exclusivity provisions of the Worker's Compensation Act, Ind.

The court determined that plaintiffs' cause of action fell squarely within the bad faith statute,&nbsp;Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father and his parents objected to the proposed adoption of the father's natural son by appellees, a natural mother and her husband, on the basis that the state adoption statute, which operated to establish the father's irrevocable, implied consent to the adoption without notice or hearing, was violative of the father's constitutional due process rights. The trial court overruled appellant father's objection to the adoption, finding that he was not entitled to notice of the adoption proceedings nor was his consent required. Accordingly, the trial court granted the adoption over appellant father's objection. Although a settlement was reached between the parties regarding visitation, the court determined that the case was one that involved a matter of great public interest and that the issues raised should be addressed. On appeal, the court held that Indiana's adoption statutes, which operated to automatically extinguish a father's rights without notice or a hearing, violated the father's rights to due process and/or due course of law as guaranteed under the United States and Indiana constitutions. The order granting the adoption was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, and the court affirmed. Defendants had governmental immunity from suit under the Indiana Tort Claims Act, Ind. Code &sect; 34-13-3-3. Plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claim also failed because the due process clause did not confer on plaintiff an affirmative right to government aid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a judgment from the Laporte Circuit Court (Indiana) sentencing him to 30 years in prison with five years suspended following his guilty plea to possession of cocaine, a Class A felony, under Ind. Code &sect; 35-4-6- (Supp. 1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was arrested after he was found with drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. He was charged with numerous offenses and, while out on bond, committed two more drug-related offenses. Under a plea agreement, he pled guilty to possession of cocaine in exchange for plaintiff state's dismissal of all other charges. Defendant appealed his 30-year sentence. The court found that the presumptive sentence under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-4 (1993) was 30 years. The lower court did not have to explain its reasons for imposing the presumptive sentence, but did list aggravating and mitigating factors in the order. The lower court did not err in considering the subsequent arrests as aggravating factors, but did err by using the facts surrounding the subsequent arrests. That was an improper consideration, as the subsequent charges were dropped in defendant's plea agreement. The court remanded to allow the lower court to reweigh all valid factors. The court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6, regarding drug offenses in a school zone, imposed strict liability. The imposition of a 30-year sentence for defendant's crime was not so disproportionate as to shock the conscience.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant's 30-year sentence for cocaine possession was affirmed in part because the sentence for such a grave crime was not so disproportionate as to shock the conscience. The judgment was reversed in part because the lower court considered improper aggravating factors in imposing sentence, and remanded for a proper determination of sentence using valid aggravating and mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought an interlocutory review from the Tippecanoe County Court (Indiana), which ordered that appellant testify as a victim-witness in a battery case in exchange for a grant of use immunity offered by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant victim-witness filed an interlocutory appeal from an order that she testify in a battery case in exchange for a grant of use immunity offered by the state. Appellant argued that the order violated her privilege against self-incrimination, as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. V and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, where her compelled testimony would reveal self-incriminating evidence of untruthfulness. Appellant claimed that to force her to testify necessarily would show that either that she gave false information in her first statement to police or that she perjured herself in a later sworn statement to the prosecutor's office recanting her prior statement. The court determined that the perjury exception in Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-3-3 applied only to present perjury, that is, perjury committed as part of compelled testimony. The court construed &sect; 35-37-3-3(b) to be constitutionally valid; the grant of use immunity required that appellant testify truthfully under a grant of use immunity but protected appellant from prosecution for past perjurious statements thereby revealed. Thus, the court affirmed the order that appellant be compelled to testify.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed the university's rules governing resident and non-resident tuition rates violated constitutional due process and equal protection rights. Appellant later amended the complaint to allege the same violations, but deleted all reference to &sect; 1983. Appellees moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, finding appellant's case was readily distinguishable from prior actions, alleging constitutional violations allowed to be brought directly under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Appellant's election to pay the tuition fees in order to attend the university was not compelled but rather chosen. Moreover, appellant's payment of the fees did not constitute a taking, and appellant had merely stated a claim for damages, excluded against both the state university and its officials acting within their official capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, convicted sex offenders, brought suit against appellee, the director of the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute, and alleged their inclusion in the Indiana Sex Offender Registry violated the prohibitions against ex post facto laws contained in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 24. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court agreed that the Indiana Sex Offender Registration statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 5-2-12-1 et seq., applied retroactively to appellants and therefore the specific issue was whether the registration and notification provisions imposed additional punishment for appellants' crimes. The court applied a two-step process for determining whether inclusion in the registry was punishment. First, the court determined that the legislature had not intended inclusion in the registry to be a criminal sanction because the statute was not part of the criminal code and its design signified a regulatory intent. Next, the court held appellants had not met their burden of providing proof that the statute had a punitive purpose or effect. The court therefore affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the driver a fire truck involved in a collision with another fire truck. Both drivers were driven to a drug testing lab for drug testing. Later, a police officer heard from an unidentified source that defendant's drug tests were positive. The prosecutor then issued a subpoena duces tecum directing the testing lab to produce defendant's results. The lab complied, and the results revealed defendant tested positive for marijuana. Defendant was charged with operating a vehicle with a controlled substance in his blood. Defendant moved to suppress his test results. The lower court denied his motion and certified the issue for interlocutory appeal. The court reversed the denial of defendant's suppression motion. The prosecutor exceeded his statutory authority for issuing a subpoena because there was no reliable information to warrant probable cause. Also, the subpoena represented an unreasonable demand on the test lab because it did not have the legal authority to comply. The court found that the use of the mandatory drug testing policy to pursue criminal prosecutions against defendant was a violation of defendant's constitutional rights under the U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the action was barred by the statute of limitations in Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-1.5-5.

On appeal, appellant argued that the motion to correct errors was erroneously granted because the motion was untimely filed and because appellees did not have a meritorious defense to the summary judgment motion. The appeals court reversed the decision and remanded the matter for reinstatement of the summary judgment for appellant. The court ruled that the motion to correct errors was improperly granted because appellees were aware of the trial court's summary judgment ruling well before the 30 days for filing an appeal had elapsed, but appellees neglected to file an appeal. The court noted that relief under Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied appellant's petition to disqualify a senior judge appointed by the supreme court to perform temporary judicial duties on behalf of the court of appeals from serving as a judge in his case. The court held that the Indiana Constitution did not prohibit the appointment of senior judges to perform temporary judicial duties on behalf of the Indiana Court of Appeals. The court determined that the Indiana Supreme Court had statutory authority to appoint the judge as a senior judge of the Indiana Court of Appeals under Ind. Code &sect; 33-2.1-5-1 (1993). The court rejected appellant's argument that the judge lacked authority to decide his case because he had not been appointed senior judge at the time the court of appeals obtained jurisdiction over his case. The court of appeals' jurisdiction lies in the court as a whole, not individual judges or districts. The judge did not hold an office as that term was meant by Ind. Const. art. II, &sect; 9, and his service as a senior judge did not violate that provision. Finally, the court disagreed that the judge's impartially might reasonably be questioned under the facts of the case. Therefore, his disqualification was not required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment for appellee based on appellant's lack of standing. Appellant sought review of the amounts reimbursed and appellee's methodologies, procedures, and standards related thereto. The court held that where appellant, as a caretaker relative under the act, was intended to have been benefitted under the act, she had a demonstrable interest in a correct determination of her reimbursement from appellee; therefore, she had standing to seek judicial review of whether she was paid the correct amount.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the reversal of the decision by the Police Merit Board (Board) that terminated appellee employee as an officer with the police department.

Further, the evidence of record was adequate to support the conclusion that appellee violated each departmental rule cited by the Board in its decision terminating employment as an officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owner and unrelated residents, disputed a decision of the Monroe County Circuit Court (Indiana), which denied their motion for summary judgment. Appellants argued that Bloomington, Ind., Municipal Code &sect; 20.02.01.00, a zoning ordinance, which prohibited property being occupied by more than four adults who were unrelated by blood, marriage, or adoption, was an ultra vires act and it violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Whether the ordinance was an ultra vires act depended upon the interpretation of the enabling statutes,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 36-7-4-601 and 36-7-4-201, which granted local governments the power to zone. The court agreed with the city that the statutes mandated that the city would provide healthful surroundings for family life and promote the general welfare and safety of its citizens. The dispositive issue was, therefore, whether the city constitutionally defined &quot;family&quot; in the ordinance. The court considered art. I, &sect; 23, the Equal Privileges Clause of the Indiana Constitution. The court held that appellants had the burden of disproving the city's bases for the classification that were readily apparent, including but not limited to those set forth in the ordinance, and those reasonably relied upon by the city during the course of the litigation. However, by objecting to appellants' interrogatory and receiving an order from the trial court relieving it of the duty to answer the interrogatory, the city thwarted appellants' attempt to discover what bases the city advanced in support of the ordinance. Therefore, the court expressed no opinion on the merits of appellants' argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and remanded for further proceedings. In particular, the court directed that appellants should be given a reasonable opportunity for discovery in order to determine what goals the ordinance was designed to promote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor charged defendant with three counts of nonsupport, under Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-5, for failure to support his three minor children. Defendant failed to appear at trial or sentencing, and the Tippecanoe Superior Court (Indiana) convicted defendant on all three counts, and was sentenced to three consecutive three-year sentences for a total of nine years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previous been convicted of nonsupport, and argued the following: (1) the statute was unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and improperly delegated legislative powers to the prosecutor; (2) his convictions violated double jeopardy because he had previously been convicted for nonsupport of the same children; (3) the prosecutor arbitrarily divided the offenses into separate time periods in order to charge three separate offenses; and (4) he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel. The court determined that the statute clearly informed defendant of the criminal penalties attached to his failure to support his children, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and he could be prosecuted again under the same statute because the previous prosecution was for a specified period of time in the past which did not overlap the periods of time presently at issue. The court ruled that the consecutive sentences which resulted from three separate charges and convictions constituted multiple punishments for the same offense, and therefore defendant could be convicted and sentenced for only one crime. Defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was remanded with instructions to vacate two of the convictions and resentence accordingly.</SPAN></P>

The patient filed a complaint pursuant to the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act, Ind. Code &sect; 27-12-1 et seq., which alleged the doctor negligently monitored her elevated intraocular pressure. The trial court granted the doctor's motion for summary judgment because the patient's action was bared by the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under Ind. Code &sect; 27-12-7-1 a medical malpractice claim had to be filed within two years after the date of the alleged act. The court held that even if the doctor was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense due to fraudulent concealment, the patient was required to institute an action within a reasonable time after the alleged malpractice was deemed to have been discovered. The court found that the patient waited over two years after discovering the alleged malpractice, which was deemed unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the father waived any argument regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 31-1-11.7-2 because he did not raise the argument at trial. Although the court held that the father waived any argument regarding his status as a stepparent on the same basis, the court noted that the father still would be a stepparent for statutory purposes even though his late wife's daughter was not born during a previous marriage. The court held that the grandmother's visitation rights survived the adoption by the father, a stepparent, even where the adoption occurred after the death of the child's natural mother. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the grandmother visitation rights based on its factual findings because, although the grandmother did exhibit misconduct in the custody proceedings, the grandmother finally agreed to forego any custody claim to her granddaughter.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-42-4-9. He appealed and claimed that the trial court improperly instructed the jury, the State presented insufficient evidence to convict him, and his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neither defendant nor the State objected to the jury instructions or tendered an instruction of their own regarding the elements of sexual misconduct with a minor. Therefore, defendant waived review of that issue. The instructions on sexual misconduct with a minor tracked the language of the statute and did not preclude consideration of the intent element of the crime. The instructions given to the jury contained words that in their plain meaning could be understood by the jury as including criminal intent and did not mislead the jury as to the law of the case. To sustain the conviction, the State needed to prove that defendant did: (1) perform sexual intercourse; (2) with the victim; (3) when defendant was at least eighteen years of age, and (4) when the victim was at least fourteen years of age, but less than sixteen. The testimony from the victim regarding the defendant's acts was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The defendant failed to show that his counsel's substandard performance was so prejudicial as to deny him a fair trial and, but for his trial counsel's actions, that the outcome of the trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found for the landowner. On appeal, however, the court reversed. The city's zoning code and the special use ordinance did not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because they did not constitute an unreasonable burden on the landowner. The special use ordinance was not a prior restraint on religious speech because it did not impermissibly imbue the city's board of zoning appeals with unfettered discretion. The trial court clearly erred when it found that the zoning code discriminated against Christians.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court stated that dispositive issue was whether, in the exercise of its judicial authority to control the administrative process and temper an agency's power to assess penalties, it should have prohibited IDEM from imposing a penalty against the company for the operation of its transfer station that: (1) never posed a threat to the environment; and (2) had become expressly permitted by law since the issuance of the preliminary injunction . The 1997 promulgation of Ind. Code &sect; 13-11-2-235 legalized the very operation in which the company had been engaged. This distinctive statute was enacted specifically to remedy the plight of the company. The premise upon which the doctrine of amelioration rested compelled the court to exercise its judicial authority over the administrative process and prohibit IDEM from imposing penalties against the company under those circumstances. IDEM should also have been prohibited from imposing any type of penalty against the company for its past operation of the transfer facility.</SPAN></P>

The court held defendant's claim of unconstitutionality was without merit. The legislature was free to give the trial court authority to render a modification of the sentence with whatever conditions and within whatever time it deemed appropriate. The court found that Ind.

The driver submitted to a portable breath test, which resulted in him being arrested and informed that if he refused to submit to a chemical breath test, his driving privileges were subject to suspension for one year. The driver failed to give an adequate breath sample on four different occasions. Thus, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-6-8, his license was suspended. The trial court denied the driver's petition for judicial review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Ind. Code &sect; 9-309-6-10(f), which required one to show that the license suspension was erroneous, was constitutional and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court was unable to say that placing the burden of going forward with the evidence at the hearing on the driver created a substantial risk of erroneously depriving him of his license. He was not entitled to a jury trial under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 on the issue of whether he refused to submit to a chemical test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues for the court were whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury and whether the punitive damage award violated due process. The insurance company declined coverage because it claimed that no policy was ever written to cover the insured's interest in the bowling alley. On appeal, the court held that the jury might have been better instructed had it been given the definition of a general agent. However, when the challenged instruction was read together with the other instructions, the court did not find the instruction to be a misstatement of the law constituting an abuse of discretion. The trial did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury on any issue. Further, given the nature of the insurance company's conduct, the court did not find that punitive damages in an amount nearly 14 times the compensatory damages awarded so lacked a reasonable relationship between those two figures as to render the punitive damage award constitutionally unacceptable. Therefore, although the ratio of punitive to actual damages was high, the court did not conclude that the punitive damages were so grossly excessive as to violate the constitutional limits of due process.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that defendant's constitutional argument failed for two reasons: (1) it was waived because it was not properly raised in the trial court, and (2) the term &quot;extreme pain&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because it was not a term that persons of average intelligence could not understand. The court also held that the trial court did not err when it denied defendant's Motion for Discharge because defendant failed to cite any factual basis or evidence for his contention that the delay in bringing him to trial was not due to the congestion of the trial court's calendar. The court further found sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction because a reasonable jury could have found that the offense resulted in serious bodily injury to the victim in that the victim sustained multiple bruises, a damaged wrist, a concussion, and a three-inch head wound.</SPAN></P>

The trial court subsequently upheld the board's decision, and on appeal the court affirmed, holding that under the wording of Evansville, Ind.

The court then rejected the business' argument that requiring a permit to change the wording on the sign violated its constitutional right to free speech, as the ordinance was content neutral, and the ordinance advanced the legitimate governmental interest of aesthetics and traffic safety. The permit requirement enabled the commission to verify the alteration of the design did not affect the characteristics that were allowed under the previous permit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute required lobbyists to register and file reports. The commission was an agency of the legislative branch. The commission collected the reports, made them available to the public, and conducted audits.

The court held that each branch of government was allowed to perform incidental activities, that appeared the duties of another branch, where necessary to carry out its proper powers. Thus, even thought the power of appointment was generally a legislative function, the legislature had the authority to appoint the commission's members as an incidental power. The regulation of lobbyists was incidental to the functions of the legislature. The legislature had a legitimate interest in regulating those who sought to influence its members. While the commission was given authority to investigate violation of the statute, hold hearings, and impose civil remedies, criminal investigations and prosecutions were performed by the executive and judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Journey Account Statute did not apply to reinstate the claim because it failed due to negligence in the prosecution. The patient and wife also argued that the cause of action was not time-barred because the statute of limitations prescribed for medical malpractice actions, Ind. Code &sect; 27-12-7-1, was declared unconstitutional. The court held that a determination that the &quot;occurrence&quot; statute of limitations was unconstitutional was not necessary because the claim was time-barred even under the discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

The town consistently cited the unique scenic and architectural characteristics of the town and concerns for public safety as the reason for enacting the ordinance. The court determined that nothing more was required to defeat the first prong of the restaurant owner's argument. The court determined that the town's ban of neon signs was no more extensive than necessary to further the town's interests in safety and aesthetics.

He claimed in part that double jeopardy principles barred his prosecution for the drug offense because he had previously received an Indiana Controlled Substance Excise Tax assessment for the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revenue department assessed a CSET tax against defendant for the sale of cocaine. He also pleaded guilty to delivery of cocaine as a Class B felony. In a petition for post-conviction relief, he claimed that double jeopardy barred his conviction on the drug charge. The trial court denied relief, but the court reversed the judgment, ruling first that although defendant's time for appeals had expired, he was allowed to bring the petition. A new case had held that double jeopardy principles barred a prosecution for a particular drug offense after imposition of the CSET tax. Retroactive application of new criminal procedure rules was permitted when they prohibited a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense. Because the prosecution of defendants assessed a CSET for the same drug offense had been prohibited for that reason, the rules applied retroactively. Further, because the assessment constituted a punishment for double jeopardy purposes, it was error to independently analyze whether the tax was a punishment. The trial court also failed to consider all four relevant factors in determining whether the tax constituted a punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute authorized an increase in the economic development income tax in Indiana counties and cities falling within certain narrowly defined population ranges. Only one county fell within this range, and the taxpayers contended that the imposition of the tax violated several of their state and federal constitutional rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the tax was constitutional. The court found that the legislation was confined to one subject as required by Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19. The court found no equal protection violation, holding that there was a rational reason for the difference in taxes from one county to another because the taxpayers lived in a county that had substantial liability for pollution cleanup costs. The court found no violation of the privileges and immunities clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court held that the creation of local entities for the purpose of public improvements did not violate the prohibition against the creation of corporations by special act in Ind. Const. art. XI, &sect; 13. The court found that an argument based on Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 was barred by the law of the case doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of child molesting and two counts of incest. He was also found to be an habitual offender and was sentenced for an aggregate term of 30 years. His convictions were upheld on direct appeal. Defendant then filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The post-conviction court vacated one of defendant's habitual offender enhancements and his two incest convictions, but denied relief in all other respects. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) a caselaw decision which prohibited the exclusion of alibi testimony by defendants was not retroactively available to defendant; and, (2) defendant waived his complaint that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury on the definition of prior unrelated felony, since he did not tender a proposed instruction or raise the issue on direct appeal. However, the court also held that it was fundamental error not to instruct the jury on &quot;prior unrelated felony;&quot; therefore, counsel's failure to raise this issue on appeal constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged the charges as violating ex post facto principles, arguing that their accrual of at least $ 10,000 in arrearages occurred before the law was enacted. The trial court dismissed the charges. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that &sect; 35-46-1-5(a) was not an ex post facto law as applied to defendants because it did not punish them for past acts. Rather, the court explained, the law criminalized nonsupport, and the state had properly charged defendants with nonsupport that occurred after the law was enacted. The court further explained that defendants were not being punished for their past accrual of $ 10,000 in arrearages as a separate offense; the felony status of the underlying offense of nonsupport was merely being enhanced by reason of the amount of arrearages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were whether the trial court erred when it concluded that: (1) the denial of &quot;idle pay&quot; to PCU inmates did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (2) the State complied with Ind. Code &sect; 11-10-5-1, which required the State to provide educational programs to inmates. The appellate court held that voluntary PCU inmates were entitled to receive &quot;idle pay&quot; to the same extent that it was provided to the general population and to those inmates involuntarily committed to PCU. Although the State had a legitimate government interest in withholding &quot;state pay&quot; from inmates who did not work or participate in education or vocational programs, the State failed to demonstrate a legitimate penological interest in providing such pay to some but not all inmates. In addition, the State violated the Indiana Code by denying education programs to PCU inmates. While Ind. Code &sect; 11-10-5-1 did not impose an obligation to provide each program to each inmate or a right on the part of an inmate to gain access to each program, the statute mandated that access to some form of education program be provided to all inmates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landlords owned two student rental properties which were in nonconformance with local ordinances because they were rented to more than three adults. Appellant Bloomington, Indiana, Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA), appealed the judgment of the Monroe Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted a writ of certiorari relief from a decision of the BZA upon the application of the landlords.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the BZA raised several issues relating to housing code violations, grandfather registration, and continuous use. The appellate court concluded that the trial court correctly determined that the landlords' predecessor's failure to register the rental units under the housing code did not render the uses unlawful so as to work a forfeiture of the vested rights to the nonconforming uses. In addition, the trial court correctly determined that a vested property interest in a nonconforming use could not be forfeited by the mere failure to register it under a grandfathering provision. The trial court reversed the BZA's finding on the basis that the only evidence submitted showed the continuous occupancy of the rental units in nonconformity with the ordinance. The appellate court agreed that there was no evidence in the record that occupancy of the rentals dropped below four unrelated adults. Moreover, there had never been any contention that the landlords had ever intended to abandon the nonconforming uses. Therefore, the trial court correctly determined that the BZA's decision could not be sustained on the basis that the landlords failed to prove continuous nonconformity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Medicaid recipients had medical problems that caused foot pain so severe they could not walk without orthopedic shoes. An amendment to state Medicaid regulations excluded coverage for these shoes. The recipients brought an action to enjoin the state from eliminating the shoe coverage and sought a declaratory judgment to invalidate the regulatory amendment. They then filed a summary judgment motion, based in part on affidavits in which their physicians attested that the shoes were medically necessary. The trial court concluded that the state Medicaid program was required to pay for medically necessary items and granted summary judgment. The trial court also stated that the decision of whether or not certain devices were medically necessary rested with the recipient's physician. The state appealed. The court affirmed and held that (1) the state had to cover medically necessary treatments in service areas in which the state opted to provide coverage; (2) the state, not the physician, defined medical necessity, so long as the definition comported with the federal Medicaid laws; and (3) the amendment eliminating coverage for medically necessary orthopedic shoes was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant personal representative of the estate had opened the estate on the last day of the year following decedent's death with notice to all known creditors and by publication pursuant to Ind.

The court determined that, if commencement of the action was not within the specified time, the action and the right of action no longer existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously been convicted of reckless homicide following a motor vehicle accident. The local newspaper published an article intimating that the accident was alcohol-related. This coverage led defendant to request a change of venue. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was deprived of his right to a fair trial because the trial court denied his request to move the trial to another county. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to move the trial to another county. The court of appeals noted that the trial court painstakingly attempted to select a jury which would ignore any prior knowledge of the defendant and decide the case solely upon the evidence. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erroneously refused to strike two jurors for cause. The court of appeals found no abuse of discretion based on the jurors' assurances that they could be fair and impartial. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court's assessment of jury fees was unconstitutional. In reversing the assessment, the court of appeals noted that there was no statutory authority in Indiana for such an assessment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no evidence that the Act restricted the definition of stepparent to circumstances when the parent was previously married at the time of the child's birth.

The trial court granted the doctor's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed and held, inter alia, that Ind.

Furthermore, held the court, the Medical Malpractice Act did not violate Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action initiated by the ex-wife under the Title IV-D program, a master commissioner found the ex-husband in contempt for failing to pay child support. On appeal, the ex-husband raised several issues having to do with the validity of the order, whether the commissioner abused her discretion by failing to recuse herself, whether the procedure used was constitutional, and whether sufficient evidence supported the trial court's finding of contempt. The court held that, pursuant to state statute, the commissioner was specifically granted the authority to punish contempt under Ind. Code &sect; 33-5.1-2-11(e). Also, the state had authority under Ind. Code &sect; 12-17-2-22 to provide child support enforcement services to people who did not receive public assistance. Further, the court ruled that the ex-husband failed to establish an actual bias that would require the recusal of the commissioner. Finally, the court found that the constitutional proscription against imprisonment for debt was inapplicable because child support obligations did not constitute a debt. The evidence was sufficient to find that the ex-husband willfully neglected his duty although he had the financial ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment was denied and they filed a notice of appeal.

Plaintiff did not replead, but filed a motion to dismiss the appeal based on defendants' failure to file a bond. Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to replead the complaint. The appellate court granted defendants' motion to dismiss and denied plaintiff's motion to correct errors. The court affirmed the dismissal. It found that appeals from the small claims action were to be tried de novo and that the phrase &quot;de novo&quot; contemplated repleading the case, even after an otherwise final judgment had been rendered. Further, plaintiff did not dispute that she was aware of the instruction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a woman had lived together for many years in her trailer home when he left at her request.

When police arrived, defendant was standing outside the home, smelling of alcohol. When asked to identify himself, defendant said he did not live in the house, had not been invited inside, and had forced his way into the home. On appeal from his conviction, he raised three issues: (1) whether the residential entry statute,&nbsp;Ind.

The court affirmed, holding that the residential entry statute was constitutional, that there was sufficient evidence supporting the conviction, and that defendant had waived the right to appeal the admission of the statements for failure to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

The dentist contended that he was entitled to summary judgment because the complaint was filed outside of the occurrence-based two-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions contained in Ind.

The court held that subsequent to the case being fully briefed, it had concluded that the occurrence-based medical malpractice statute of limitations was unconstitutional. The statute violated Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana legislature passed a law which provided for the reformation of the Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS). The bill contained limitations on the subject matter of collective bargaining and other provisions that affected IPS teachers. An IPS teacher and two teachers associations filed a complaint, claiming that the law, because it was not confined to one subject, violated Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19, and that Ind.

After a trial on the merits, the trial court found no constitutional violation. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that although the legal connection between the budget of the state and a restriction on the right of IPS teachers to collectively bargain was tenuous, the statute contained only a single subject. Further, even though the law currently applied only to Marion County and IPS, it was not a special law in violation of Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature amended &sect; 6-1.1-12-28.5, which effectively eliminated the taxpayer's property deduction for resource recovery systems.

The taxpayer later filed a motion for certification as a class action. The governor filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

The court held that the taxpayer should have claimed a refund of the tax installment paid under Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the rule announced in recent caselaw applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. The State supreme court had found that the Indiana Controlled Substance Excise Tax (CSET) was a punishment and, thus, a jeopardy for double jeopardy purposes, which attached at the moment of assessment. In defendant's case, the marijuana, which supported the CSET was the same marijuana which supported defendant's convictions for possession and dealing. The rule constituted a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure, and it was necessary to determine if any exceptions applied. The court noted that the rule prohibited the prosecution of a specific class of defendants because of their status or offense, for example those persons who had previously been assessed a CSET for the same drug. Therefore, the rule fell squarely within an exception and was accorded full retroactive effect. The rule applied retroactively to cases on collateral review and the post-conviction court correctly vacated defendant's convictions for possession and dealing in a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother was found in contempt for violating a stipulated visitation order in an action brought by appellee grandparents under the Grandparent Visitation Statute (GVS), Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.7-1 et seq. She argued that GVS was unconstitutional and therefore any order pursuant to it was not enforceable by contempt. The court refused to address the issue because only judgments void due to lack of jurisdiction were subject to collateral attack; the constitutionality of GVS had to be addressed on direct appeal. The mother's second argument was that GVS did not provide for temporary visitation orders. This was dismissed because the parties had agreed to the order; therefore, the error, if any, was invited error and would not be reviewed. The mother's final argument was that the grandparents should not have been awarded attorney fees because GVS did not expressly provide for them. The court held that although normally the courts did not award attorney fees in the absence of statutory authority, the trial court had inherent authority to do so for civil contempt actions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was expelled for bringing a Swiss army knife to school. The review court ordered the student reinstated to school on the basis that appellants unreasonably and arbitrarily expelled the student. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and ordered the judgment vacated. The court held that the action was moot because the time during which the student was to have been expelled had passed. However, the court reviewed the issue because it was a question of significant public importance, which was likely to recur. Thus, the court held that the review court did not exceed its statutorily prescribed scope of judicial review under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 20-8.1-5.1-15 when it reversed the decision to expel the student. Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 provided a right to judicial review of administrative decisions. Also, the scope of judicial review was properly limited by the standards set forth in the Administrative Orders and Procedures Act. However, the court concluded that appellants did not act in an unreasonable and arbitrary manner. In bringing the knife to school, the student violated a validly enacted rule under which students faced automatic expulsion.</SPAN></P>

They questioned defendant's wife, who agreed to wear a body wire and talk to defendant about the crime. During the conversation, defendant made incriminating statements. He was then taken to the police station where he waived his rights, confessed to the crime, admitted where the murder weapon was and where items he stole from the victim were, and consented to the police obtaining his bags that contained blood-stained clothes. The police found the weapon and personal items of the victim and they searched the bag without a warrant. Defendant was charged with murder and robbery. He filed a motion to suppress the recorded conversation as well as all the other evidence he gave to the police. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the suppression of the recorded conversation on privilege grounds. However, because there was no Fourth Amendment violation in recording the conversation, the trial court improperly excluded all the other evidence under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court did not err in denying the widower's petition because a partial distribution under Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-17-1 was at the discretion of the trial court and the estate had a legitimate legal dispute regarding the widower's share of the estate. The court held that the legislature intended that a surviving spouse taking against the will pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-3-1 should take his or her share of the net estate of both the personalty and the real estate. The court determined that the legislative intent of Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-2-2 was to protect a portion of the widow's share of the decedent's real estate from creditors, except mortgage or lien creditors, but that &sect; 29-1-2-2 did not exempt the widow's share from the expenses of administration and funeral expenses. The court found that there was no support for the differing treatment of widows and widowers as having a fair and substantial relation to the object of Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-2-2. Although the court found that applying the protection of &sect; 29-1-2-2 only to widows violated equal protection, the court held that the provisions of &sect; 29-1-2-2 could be made applicable to all surviving spouses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property lot owners were developers of a subdivision consisting of 47 building lots.

The trial court entered judgment against the property lot owners. On appeal, the court found that Ind. Code 16-19-3-4(b)(3) authorized the State Board of Health to regulate the disposal of excremental and sewage matter. The court found no error by the trial court, ruling that because the properly lot owners had not yet applied for permits for the 11 undeveloped lots when the amended regulations became effective, the lots were properly subjected to the new regulations. The court determined that the challenge by the property lot owners that the new regulations were vague, uncertain, and arbitrary had come too late, as the issue had not been raised first in trial court. The court upheld the judgment that the property lot owners did not have their lots subjected to a regulatory taking by the new regulations and were not entitled to compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent threatened suicide and the police were dispatched to his apartment.

The widow brought this action and alleged the use of excessive force. The jury awarded her damages and the city and officer argued on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. The court affirmed the judgment. The jury could have found that, under the circumstances, the force that the officer used was unreasonable and that he violated the decedent's Fourth Amendment rights. The officer was not entitled to qualified immunity because the decedent's constitutional rights were sufficiently clear enough so that any reasonable officer would have understood that his actions in this instance violated those rights. The jury also could have concluded that the city's failure to have a policy on suicide intervention would likely have resulted in the deprivation of citizens' constitutional rights. Thus, the verdict against the city was also proper.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the court held that the initial warrant to search defendant's studio authorized the search of the safe. The court concluded that contact or knowledge by a judge obtained outside the setting of a formal hearing did not per se invalidate a search warrant, and defendant failed to offer any evidence of bias or prejudice on the part of the issuing judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union was the exclusive bargaining representative for a school corporation's teachers. Their CBA imposed a fair share fee on teachers that did not belong to the union. The union also adopted an internal remedy providing for a pro rata refund of the fair share fee. The non-members challenged the validity of the fair share fee provision. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the union. The non-members appealed from that judgment, which was reversed. The trial court was instructed to grant the non-members summary judgment on remand. The court noted that requiring nonunion employees to support a union impacted their First Amendment rights. Therefore, only those activities that were germane to the collective-bargaining process were chargeable to nonunion employees. Furthermore, a union bore the burden of establishing that its procedures dealing with fair share fees were tailored to minimize the infringement on First Amendment rights. Therefore, the court found that the rebate provided by the union was insufficient because it did not ensure that the non-members' funds would not be used temporarily for ideological purposes unrelated to collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sought review of a grant of summary judgment from the Monroe Circuit Court (Indiana) in favor of appellee physician. The trial court determined that the patient's malpractice claim against the physician was barred by the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations, Ind. Code &sect; 27-12-7-1(b), because she had not proven that the statute was tolled by the physician's active fraudulent concealment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's malpractice claim against the physician alleged that he was negligent in his care and treatment due to his failure to diagnose and treat her breast cancer in a timely manner. The physician had treated a lump in the patient's breast, after which he did not treat her again. Over three years later, the patient discovered that she had breast cancer and had to undergo a mastectomy. The patient argued that the malpractice statute of limitations applied against her was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court agreed and declared that Ind. Code &sect; 27-12-7-1(b) was unconstitutional because, unlike the general tort statute of limitations, it began to run at the occurrence of the alleged negligence rather than at the discovery of the alleged negligence. The court held that such disparate treatment of medical malpractice victims from other tort victims was against Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court also held that Ind. Code &sect; 27-12-7-1(b) violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, the &quot;open courts&quot; provision, because it effectively abrogated the right to a complete tort remedy. The court also found a genuine issue of material fact regarding the physician's alleged fraudulent concealment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the physician and held that the medical malpractice statute applied to the patient's claim violated the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Marion County Municipal Court, Criminal Division (Indiana), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while his driving privileges were suspended as an habitual violator of traffic laws as a class A misdemeanor, a violation of Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-10-16 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew his driving privileges had been suspended as an habitual traffic offender because the notice of suspension was inadequate. The court agreed and reversed. The court stated that the State must present evidence that demonstrated that a letter of suspension was mailed to defendant's last known address in order to prove such notice. Moreover, the address must have been defendant's last known address as of the date upon which the letter of suspension was mailed. The court held that in order to convict an individual of the offense of driving while an habitual offender of traffic laws the State had the burden of proving that the individual knew of his suspension. When the bureau of motor vehicles had notice that an individual resided at a more current address than one listed in its records, the more current address was in fact an individual's last known address, and it could not ignore this information and rely upon outdated records. To predicate an inference of knowledge of suspension upon a letter mailed to an address other than an individual's last known address defeated the purpose of the notice requirement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to suppress certain evidence. The trial court denied the motion to suppress and defendant filed an interlocutory appeal. Defendant contended that Ind. Code &sect; 9-25-8-2 did not require that the owner or operator of a motor vehicle show proof of financial responsibility but only that financial responsibility with respect to the vehicle be in effect. The court held that a failure to show proof of financial responsibility was not a chargeable offense, and that defendant's arrest on such grounds was unlawful. Further, the court held that Indiana law no longer required a motorist to prove financial responsibility for a vehicle. Therefore, the court reasoned either that the officers were unaware that Ind. Code &sect; 9-25-8-2 had been amended or that the arrest was a pretense for searching defendant's purse.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the judgment of the Shelby County Superior Court (Indiana), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information charging him with three counts of seducing a 16-year-old male. The state asserted that the trial court erred in holding that the county youth shelter was not a foster care facility and that defendant was not a custodian of the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child seduction statute defined &quot;custodian&quot; as a person responsible for a child's welfare. The state claimed that as a child-care worker, defendant was a &quot;custodian&quot; as defined by the statute. Defendant countered that the trial court correctly held that a custodian was a person in a position of authority similar to that of an adoptive parent, adoptive grandparent, guardian, or stepparent. The court turned to the rules of statutory construction to resolve the question. The court found the term custodian was used together with guardian, adoptive parent, adoptive grandparent, and stepparent. The grouping of &quot;custodian&quot; with these terms and the definition of responsible indicated a legislative intent that as used in the statute &quot;custodian&quot; meant an individual who occupied a position of trust, authority and responsibility in loco parentis. Here, the state's evidence showed that defendant was a staff employee. The court held that to be a &quot;custodian&quot; within the meaning of the child seduction statute, an individual had to exercise more than limited or occasional supervision over a child. Because defendant was not responsible for the child's welfare, the charges were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the three charges of child seduction be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

He contended that his conviction of aggravated battery as a Class B felony pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-1.5 violated the proscriptions contained in Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 24 and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, cl. 1 against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied petitioner's request for post-conviction relief and, on appeal, the court reversed. The court vacated petitioner's conviction on the ground that &sect; 35-42-1-1.5 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law because it was not in effect at the time of the shooting and it made the crime of aggravated battery greater than when it was committed and imposed additional punishment, in that &sect; 35-42-1-1.5 provided for elevation of battery to a Class B felony, whereas the earlier battery statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-1-1, had not. The court further held that retrial for attempted murder was precluded by the prohibition on double jeopardy contained in the Fifth Amendment and in Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-4-3(a)(1). The court held, however, that petitioner could be tried for the different offense of battery with a deadly weapon and that the evidence justified convicting him of that offense without retrial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment denying petitioner's request for post-conviction relief, vacated petitioner's conviction of aggravated assault as a Class B felony and his sentence, and remanded the case with instructions to enter judgment and sentence on the offense of battery with a deadly weapon, a Class C felony, a lesser included offense of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>

Although the instructions violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, which gave to the jury the right to determine the law and the facts in all criminal cases, they did not make it impossible for the inmate to have a fair hearing. Because the trial court gave 25 instructions addressing alleged prior convictions, the definition of &quot;felony conviction,&quot; and the sequence of events required to support a habitual offender finding, the court was not convinced that the inmate's sentence was clearly wrong.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Dubois County Office of Family and Children (DCOFC) and others, sought an interlocutory appeal of a judgment of the Dubois Juvenile Court (Indiana), which denied appellants' motion to dismiss appellee licensed foster parent's petition to expunge the juvenile court records relating to the foster parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foster parent and his wife were both licensed foster parents. The foster parent was accused of molesting two children for whom his wife was babysitting. An investigation by the DCOFC and the police department substantiated the accusations. No criminal charges were filed against the foster parent but one foster child was removed from the home and no children were placed there. The foster parent filed a petition to expunge the juvenile court record pertaining to the alleged child molestations. Appellants' motion to dismiss was denied. On interlocutory appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-8-2(b) gave the juvenile court jurisdiction to order the expungement of records relating to a person's involvement in juvenile court proceedings. However, neither the children who accused the foster parent of molesting them nor the child removed from the home was involved in any juvenile court proceedings. Thus, the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to order the expungement of records relating to the children. Consequently, it was error to deny appellants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted an order compelling the State to provide that discovery and the deputy prosecutor was subpoenaed to testify for the defense with respect to any deals or understanding the State had with the primary co-conspirator to obtain her testimony. The trial court granted the State's motion to quash the subpoena and entered a protective order prohibiting the defense from calling the prosecutor as a witness. Defendant asserted that the trial court violated his right to a compulsory process. The court reversed defendant's convictions, holding that the trial court abused its discretion in quashing defendant's subpoena to obtain the deputy prosecutor's testimony which, in turn, violated his right to compulsory process, resulting in the denial of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile and his parents filed a &sect;1983 claim and state tort claim against various government entities and employees arising out his assault and rape by another inmate in the juvenile detention center. All defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied the motion to all parties on both claims. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held, among other things, that: (1) the juvenile court and the judge, in her official capacity, were not &quot;persons&quot; under &sect; 1983; (2) plaintiffs' did not provide a formal written policy or informal custom of the county which caused the alleged constitutional violation under &sect; 1983; and (3) the county did not establish whether its failure to provide funding to the juvenile detention center was a discretionary planning function which entitled it to immunity on the state tort claim. The court found that the &sect; 1983 action and the state tort action could proceed against the juvenile detention officers. On the state tort claim, the court remanded for a determination of whether the county engaged in a discretionary decision-making process regarding allocation of funds for the juvenile center.</SPAN></P>

The court also reversed the denial of summary judgment to the juvenile court and judge on the state tort claim. The court affirmed the denial of summary judgment to the juvenile detention officers on the &sect; 1983 claim and for the county and detention officers on the state tort claim.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the club did not have any attributed of self-government, membership participation or ownership typically associated with a private club.

When the arresting officer drove by, defendant waved, but the other juvenile looked at the ground and glanced at the officer several times as he passed. The arresting officer became suspicious because of the inconsistent reactions to his presence and stopped the two juveniles. He discovered a gun when he frisked defendant. Defendant's motion to suppress the physical evidence was denied. On appeal, defendant argued that the stop and subsequent pat down violated his Fourth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. Vacating the conviction, the court held that the juveniles' actions in reaction to the officer's presence were not sufficiently specific and articulable facts indicative of criminal activity. Therefore, the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion at the time of the stop and the gun discovered could not be used against defendant. The court found that without the gun, there was no crime.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that stalking and invasion of privacy each contained an element that the other did not, and thus, were not the same for double jeopardy purposes, U.S. Const. amend. V and Ind.

Defendant had requested and obtained the withdrawal of five different public defenders assigned to represent him. Five weeks prior to trial, a sixth public defender was appointed to represent defendant. Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial because the manner in which the county public defender's office assigned cases to its counsel resulted in ineffective representation. In affirming the decision, the court found that a violation of a Sixth Amendment right arose only after a defendant had shown that he was prejudiced by an unfair trial. There was no allegation or proof that defendant's counsel rendered deficient performance or that defendant suffered any prejudice as a result of his counsel's performance at trial. Additionally, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant's motion for a continuance. The continuance was requested so that defendant's counsel could explore a possible defense characterized as one of diminished capacity based upon his diabetic condition. Indiana did not recognize the separate legal defense of diminished capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former electric supplier contended that the commission lacked the authority to stratify the territory because &sect; 8-1-2.3-6(3) did not specifically provide for stratification.

Code &sect; 8-1-2.3-4(b). After determining that public convenience and necessity favored allowing the new supplier to service the mine, the commission explained why it did not want to modify the boundaries using the traditional approach. The court affirmed, finding that it was within the commission's discretion to determine whether to change the boundaries and reflect the change upon the assigned service area maps. The commission based its decision to stratify on the erroneous assumption that the coal company could not privately distribute the electricity without violating the statute. However, the ability to stratify was well within the commission's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ind. Code &sect; 7.1-3-21-5 (1991) prohibited the issuance of a wholesaler liquor permit to any corporate applicant unless 60 percent of the corporation's common stock was owned by Indiana residents. The commission sought a judicial declaration of the application of the resident ownership requirement to the wholesaler and the permittees. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by remanding the issue of interpretation of the ambiguous statute to the commission. The court held that the commission had standing to bring the action under Ind. Code &sect; 7.1-2-8-3 and that the permittees had standing to participate in the action because they had some stake in the outcome. The court held that the resident ownership requirement violated the commerce clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it facially discriminated against interstate commerce and the requirement had no nexus with the putative benefits of ensuring the qualification of permit holders and the increased ease of ensuring compliance with the state law and regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which was denied. The court affirmed. Because the jury instructions as a whole instructed the jury as to the elements of the robbery, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to allege that the inmate's trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to one particular final instruction. Moreover, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise on direct appeal the admission of the testimony of a rebuttal witness whose identity was not disclosed before trial because, at the time of the inmate's trial, the State was under no obligation to disclose the witness's identity. Furthermore, the inmate's ineligibility for parole under &sect; 11-13-3-2(b)(3) because of his receipt of life sentences for two counts of murder did not violate his right to equal protection. There was nothing irrational about the legislative judgment that parole should be denied to any individual who committed two felonies generating life sentences. Moreover, a comparison of the inmate's life sentence to the determinate sentences of those convicted under the &quot;new&quot; penal code did not raise equal protection concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant engaged in furtive gestures when police stopped the car in which he was a passenger. After defendant exited the car, police found a handgun where defendant had been sitting. Defendant was convicted of dangerous possession of a handgun and appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the state presented sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction because constructive possession had been established where it was shown that defendant had the capability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the handgun. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to &sect; 35-47-10-5, which made a child's possession of a handgun a misdemeanor, and to Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-10-8, which required a five-day sentence in addition to any other penalty. There was no violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 16, 18 because the statutes were the legislature's reasonable determination of the penalties to be imposed. Nor was there a violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, the privileges and immunities clause, because the special classification created was reasonably related to the legislation's subject matter and the purpose of deterring children from possessing handguns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high school student sought to enjoin the state high school athletic association from imposing its Transfer Rule making him ineligible to participate on the varsity swimming team for the year following his transfer. The trial court enjoined the association from enforcing the Transfer Rule against the student and ordered that he be allowed to participate on the varsity swimming team. The association appealed. The court held that under binding supreme court precedent, the association's Transfer Rule was unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when applied to deny a student eligibility to participate in varsity athletics where the student had transferred from one high school to another for reasons unrelated to athletics. The court found that the association's application of its Transfer Rule was properly enjoined because the student had transferred for academic and financial reasons rather than athletic reasons. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility challenged the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission order denying its petition to increase its revenues by 19 percent. The utility asserted that the commission erred in excluding Contributions in Aid of Construction (CIAC) in determining its rate base, and that the 3.5 percent rate established was confiscatory. Appellee Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (consumer) asserted misinterpretation of Ind. Code &sect; 8-1-2-6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility petitioned the commission for approval of a 19 percent increase in its total revenues. At an evidentiary hearing, the consumer presented evidence of the CIAC to arrive at a negative rate base, and proposed a 2.95 percent increase. The commission authorized an across-the-board increase of 3.51 percent. The utility appealed, asserting that the commission erred in excluding the CIAC to determine the rate base, and that the approved rate was confiscatory. The court affirmed the commission's order. Relying on controlling precedent, it rejected the utility's proposition that Ind. Code &sect; 8-1-2-6 did not differentiate between property that was purchased or contributed. The court concluded that the utility was seeking the ability to earn a profit on property for which it had paid nothing and held that this was an incorrect interpretation of &sect; 8-1-2-6. The court further held that as the commission had not yet made a final determination respecting the rate of return on the base rate, the issue of confiscatory taking was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the commission setting the utility's rate increase at 3.5 percent in a proceeding seeking approval of a rate increase of 19 percent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was asked to quiet down, but he persisted in shouting obscenities. The court affirmed the municipal court's judgment that convicted defendant of disorderly conduct. Speech was protected under the United States Constitution when it was aimed at protesting the actions of police rather than hindering or obstructing police duties or investigations. The disorderly conduct statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-1-3, was aimed at the intrusiveness and loudness of expression, not whether the content of the language was obscene or provocative. There was sufficient evidence to show that defendant's screaming infringed upon the peace and tranquility of others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary. To prove defendant guilty of burglary, the state had to demonstrate that he broke and entered the dwelling of the victim with the specific intent to commit a felony in the dwelling pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-2-1. Defendant was convicted of burglary by the trial court and he appealed. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Defendant's trial counsel failed to object to certain testimony by the victim regarding the wallet on the basis of hearsay. The court held that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the wallet was in the bathroom with defendant because he had carried it in there from the owner's room after entering the apartment through her window. That would constitute the exercise of unauthorized control over the property and would suffice to establish the requisite intent. The court determined that defendant failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, had the statement not been admitted, there would have been insufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant broke into the apartment with the intent to commit theft.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the insured applied for worker's compensation through the Indiana Compensation Rating Bureau, the insurer was assigned to provide insurance to the insured. The premium rate was based on the insured's representations regarding its operations in Indiana. During an audit in which the insured failed to completely cooperate, the insurer discovered that Illinois was the proper state for the premium rate base, and it sought the additional premium. When the insured refused to pay, the insurer filed an action and obtained a judgment for the additional premium. The insured appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the insured's contractual rights were not impaired by the retroactive rate because the insured never had a contractual right to the lower premium rate. The court disregarded the argument that the trial court improperly reformed the contract because it had enforced the provision regarding the final premium, not reformed it. Moreover, the insured failed to pursue the mandatory administrative remedy of Ind. Code &sect; 27-7-2-20.3(c)(2) and was barred from contesting the non-Indiana rates.</SPAN></P>

The landowners did not timely file an appeal under that statute. Written notice of the orders by the hearing authority was not required. The Fourth Amendment applied in a civil context. However, due process was afforded since there were several hearings, the hearing officer heard all the evidence, and the landowners failed to follow their appellate rights. The city acted within its police powers and was not required to provide just compensation. The city also acted reasonably in removing the debris.

The trial court denied a motion for summary judgment by the SLCI and agents. The agents and SLCI appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed claims of sexual harassment against her boss who was a public official. Her statement, which the agents promised would be kept confidential and which detailed her extramarital affair with the official, was published. She was later terminated from her employment. The employee's complaint alleged wrongful discharge, invasion of privacy, and breach of contract. The SLCI and the agents contended that the trial court erred when it denied their motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that the trial court did err when it denied summary judgment. It would have been unreasonable as a matter of law for a trier of fact to have inferred that the employee was fired in retaliation for reporting the official's actions and not for the reasons outlined in her termination letter. The employee did not present a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the &quot;legitimate public interest&quot; element to prevail on a claim of public disclosure of private information. There were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to the breach of contract issue because the employee did not set forth specific facts to demonstrate a genuine issue for trial.</SPAN></P>

He requested that the association grant him an extra year of eligibility pursuant to its hardship rule. The association's executive committee denied the student's request. The student filed a complaint for injunctive relief. The trial court ruled in the student's favor, and the association appealed. The court reversed and held that: (1) the scope of review applied by the trial court was overly broad; (2) the association's refusal to grant the student an exception under the hardship rule was supported by the record; (2) the goals and purposes underlying the Eight-Semester Rule were legitimate, and the association's determination that at least some of those purposes and goals would be served by denying the student's application for an additional year of eligibility was not arbitrary and capricious; and (3) the hardship rule was constitutional and did not violate Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision from the Clinton Circuit Court (Indiana), which dismissed the indictment of defendant for violating Ind. Code &sect; 35-49-3-1 for the distribution of obscene matter. The trial court held that the indictment violated the First Amendment and the Indiana Constitution's ban on the regulation of freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a movie video store that rented adult movies. Following the rental of one such movie, defendant was indicted. On appeal, the court ruled in favor of the state. First, in accordance with &sect; 35-34-1-8 and related rules, defendant failed to file a proper motion to dismiss with supporting affidavits. However, since the state did not challenge the facts, the error was harmless. The right to possess obscene matter did not apply to the right to distribute obscene materials. The consenting adult standard did not apply to the distribution of obscenity. Thus, the First Amendment was not violated. Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 was not violated as well. Ind. Code &sect; 35-49-2-1 defined obscenity in terms of contemporary community standards, not the standards of the persons who wished to view the materials. Thus, the fact that consenting adults rented obscene tapes was of no import. The nature of a videotape did not render the tape in question less obscene. The distribution of obscenity was determined by its content, not by its packaging. Thus, the fact that the obscenity was not viewed until a VCR was used did not render the tape non-obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the indictment was reversed and remanded. The distribution of obscenity was governed by a different standard than the right to the private possession of obscenity. The indictment of defendant for violating a distribution statute was not an unconstitutional violation of the right to freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The youths alleged that Ind. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1, and laws passed pursuant to that provision, imposed an obligation upon the state to provide residential services for members of a class of emotionally disturbed children, and that the state violated the due process rights of youths in state custody, by failing to provide them with adequate treatment in a residential placement. On appeal, the court affirmed summary judgment to the state, and held that the legislative intent of the applicable statutes was to limit services for the mentally or emotionally ill to those that were available under existing appropriations, and that whether or not an individual could receive treatment depended on the resources of the state. Limitations were imposed upon Const. art. 9, &sect; 1 by a necessity to distribute and apportion available state funds for the welfare of all citizens. The Due Process Clause did not impose any affirmative right to governmental aid. States, state entities and state officials who were sued in their official capacities were not &quot;persons&quot; for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and an exception for injunctive relief was not applicable as there were no constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was repeatedly warned that its gambling devices in its post were illegal. When defendant refused to remove the devices, the state police raided the post. Defendant was convicted of unlawful gambling, promoting professional gambling, and professional gambling. Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the prohibitions against gambling activities in Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-45-5-2 to 35-45-5-4. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the statutes did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 because the riverboat and pari-mutuel exceptions to the general prohibitions against gambling created particular forms of permissible gambling, not unlawful classifications of individuals who were allowed to participate in those forms of gambling. All individuals were allowed to engage in the permissible forms of gambling. Further, there were inherent distinctions between the state and other individuals to justify the state-run lottery. The court also concluded that defendant was not denied equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment and that regulation through the gambling statutes constituted a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the post-conviction trial court erred, because the evidence did not show the handgun he possessed was operable; that the convicting trial court failed to instruct the jury on the definition of &quot;firearm&quot; according to Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-1-5; that the convicting court imposed a disproportionate sentence for his offense; and that his trial counsel in the convicting court was ineffective and his appellate counsel was ineffective in his direct appeal that affirmed his conviction by not raising the issues that he raised in his post-conviction petition. The court determined that the definition of a firearm was sufficiently common so as not to require a definition for the jury and that it was unnecessary for the firearm to be operable for a conviction. The court held that the sentencing court properly considered defendant's criminal history when assessing his sentence. The court also held that because the matters raised by defendant were not errors that his trial and appellate counsel were not ineffective for failing to raise them.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred by sentencing him under the old statute rather than under the new statute, which provided for a lesser sentence. Defendant contended that sentencing under the new statute was required under the &quot;doctrine of amelioration.&quot; According to defendant, when the trial court sentenced him under the old statute, it violated Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trust appealed from a summary judgment of the Superior Court of Porter County (Indiana), which ruled in favor of defendant utilities. The trial court held that one utility's license with a railroad company to install a fiber optic cable over its right-of-way was enforceable against the trust, thus precluding a trespass action. The trial court found the other utility to be a third party beneficiary of the license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust contended that despite the plain language of Ind. Code &sect; 8-4-35-8(a), consideration of Ind. Code &sect; 8-4-35-5 rendered the utility's license with the railroad invalid. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the utilities. The court construed the language of the relevant statutory sections together and concluded that the trust, in whom the railroad's interest vested under Ind. Code &sect; 8-4-35-5, did not obtain an enforceable interest in the right-of-way until it obtained and filed a quitclaim deed pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 8-4-35-6. Under Ind. Code &sect; 8-4-35-8(a), the trust took title to the right-of-way subject to the utility's license. Because the utility entered the land by authority of a license agreement predating the trust's acquisition of record title in the right-of-way, no trespass occurred. The court also concluded that the unambiguous language of the license agreement sufficiently indicated that the contracting parties intended to benefit one of the utilities, thereby rendering that utility a third-party beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

Because the statute had been constitutional when enacted, it was not rendered unconstitutional by any subsequent act.

The conduct for which petitioner was convicted of kidnapping would now be classified as criminal confinement, a Class C felony. Petitioner argued that proportionality required that the sentences he received be compared with what he would now receive for the same conduct. The court held that it did not. A disproportionate sentence was one that no reasonable person could find appropriate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed but remanded for a proceeding concerning the mother's financial resources. The court found that Ind.

In addition, the court found that the state constitution did not give a party a right to a jury in juvenile court proceedings nor was the Seventh Amendment applicable to state trials. As to the request for counsel, the court determined that the risk of an erroneous child in need of services adjudication did not outweigh the presumption against court-appointed counsel. The court found that the allegation of sexual abuse by the mother's boyfriend did not assure that her parental rights would be ultimately terminated. The mother was not entitled to appointment of counsel as a matter of right under the provisions of Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor brought an action seeking payment for services rendered to defendant homeowners. The Marion County Superior Court granted the homeowners' summary judgment motion that contended that Ind. Code &sect; 32-8-3-1 did not permit a mechanic's lien for landscaping services and denied the homeowners' summary judgment motion that challenged the constitutionality of the procedures for acquiring mechanic's liens. Both parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners maintained that Indiana law precluded the contractor from obtaining a mechanic's lien for the landscaping services performed because &sect; 32-8-3-1 required that the services performed involve the erection of a structure. The court found that the Indiana Supreme Court had defined the erecting requirement of &sect; 32-8-3-1 to require some physical act of labor in connection with the creation of a structure or improvement on land. The court concluded that the contractor should have been entitled to prove that its services resulted in an improvement on the homeowners' land, and that as a result, summary judgment was inappropriate. The homeowners also argued that the procedures for obtaining a mechanic's lien contained in Ind. Code &sect; 32-8-3-1 et seq. violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution as well as the Due Course of Law Clause of the Indiana Constitution. The court found that while the homeowners had a property interest in their residence and while the filing of a mechanic's lien was an interference with that property interest, the mechanic's lien did not deprive the homeowners of a significant property interest.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-48-4-2 (1994) and possession of a schedule I controlled substance, a class D felony, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-7 (1988). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant consented to a search of his apartment where the police found a Psilocybin and Psilocyn mushroom growing operation. Analysis of the mushrooms showed that they contained Psilocybin and Psilocyn. Defendant had earlier been informed by a university extension educator that growing Psilocybin and Psilocyn mushrooms was illegal. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and remanded. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-2 (1994) and Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-2-7 were not void for vagueness as alleged by defendant where Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-48-4-2 and 35-48-2-4 unambiguously prohibited possession of materials containing Psilocybin and Psilocyn and both offenses required the State to prove that defendant knew the mushrooms in his possession contained Psilocybin and Psilocyn. The court held that the Indiana statutory scheme was sufficiently explicit to inform defendant that growing and distributing Psilocybin and Psilocyn mushrooms was proscribed. The court held that defendant's conviction of the lesser-included possession offense could not stand because it was based upon the same facts as the dealing conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of dealing in a schedule I controlled substance.

The court considered the issue of whether the wearing of earrings by boys violated the student's constitutional rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XVI. The court held that: 1) the parents failed to show that the earring ban served no purpose rationally related to the educational function of the school; 2) the enforcement of community standards of dress to instill discipline was a legitimate educational function; and 3) the parents failed to show that the earring ban violated equal protection because it did not substantially relate to a legitimate government objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student moved from a private school to a public school in the same district. The athletic association's transfer rule provided that a transfer without a move by the parents resulted in ineligibility for the first year following the transfer. The student was found to be ineligible for varsity athletics. The trial court enjoined the association from preventing the student from participating on a varsity team, and the association appealed. The court found that the trial court erred in enjoining the association. The court found that the association's decisions were reviewable under the arbitrary and capricious standard. Substantial evidence of probative value supported the association's determination that the student was ineligible. The treatment of transfer students without a corresponding change in residence separately from students transferring with a change of residence was reasonably related to the association's purpose in deterring school jumping and applied equally to all persons similarly situated so there was no violation of the Indiana Constitution. The court concluded that the trial court did not err by prohibiting the enforcement of the association's restitution rule.</SPAN></P>

On review, he contended that the trial court erred in denying him relief based on fundamental error and ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the trial court erred in sentencing him. The court affirmed. The court held (1) that the giving of an allegedly flawed instruction did not rise to an error that was fundamental in nature, as an instruction on voluntary manslaughter was not required absent evidence of sudden heat and there was no evidence that the niece had provoked the prisoner in any manner; (2) that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct by questioning witnesses concerning the prisoner's mental state, as the prisoner had invoked the defense of insanity; and (3) that the prisoner's sentence was properly enhanced, as the trial court found that a reduced sentence would have depreciated the seriousness of the crime and that one of the victims was only six years old.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-48-4-6(b)(2) (1993), failure to pay the Controlled Substance Excise Tax, a class D felony, Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers, suspecting drug activity, approached defendant where he stood at an intersection within 700 feet of a school. Defendant fled but was caught within one block. Cocaine was found on him. Affirming, the court determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment. The court reviewed the evidence of probative value in the light most favorable to support the verdict. The evidence supported the jury's inference that defendant possessed the drug while he was within 1,000 feet of the school. Defendant's conviction for failure to pay the Controlled Substance Excise Tax did not violated the double jeopardy clause of .S. Const. amend V or Ind. Const. art 1, &sect; 14. Defendant was convicted of failure to pay the tax contemporaneously with his conviction for the drug charge, so the double jeopardy clause was not implicated. The tax was meant to work independently from the statutes governing drug offenses. The intent of the legislature in imposing the tax had to be for the tax to be in addition to punishment for the underlying drug offense.</SPAN></P>

After a year, the homeowner filed for an extension of the protective order. The lower court extended the protective order for an additional year. In affirming, the court held that (1) the daughter was a member of the homeowner's household and the homeowner was authorized to obtain a protective order on her behalf, (2) the application of Ind.

(1994) against the City and its Sanitary District after rainwater and sewage filled their basements. The attorney for the proposed class gave the city a notice, which contained names and addresses for 60 plaintiffs and stated that between 800 and 900 homes and businesses had been affected. The homeowners filed a motion for class certification. The superior court denied the motion to certify the class and granted the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the issue of inverse condemnation. The court examined the notice requirements of the Act and found that the names and number of claimants were essential elements for substantial compliance. Actual notice alone would not suffice. The court held that the notice requirements of the Act applied to classes as well as to individual plaintiffs. The court also examined whether the plaintiffs for whom proper notice was rendered had a claim under the Act. The court held that a single act of negligence that resulted in the homeowners' property damage was not an unconstitutional taking as a matter of law. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

It was sufficient to support his conviction.  Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-10 was not void for vagueness because its reasonableness standard and its requirement of proof of a continuing course of conduct provided standards indicating where the line was drawn between trivial and substantial acts. The trial court did not err in considering the facts that defendant crossed state lines and that he confronted his victim at a shelter as aggravating circumstances when he was sentenced. He was not attempting to enforce laws not yet enacted, he imposed the presumptive sentence according to Ind. Code &sect; (19xx) 35-50-3-3, and defendant showed no harm.</SPAN></P>

While the petition was pending, an auto manufacturer announced plans to build a plant in the cooperative's service area. The manufacturer asked the utility to provide service to it because the cooperative did not have the capability of providing the necessary power. The utility petitioned the Commission for permission to provide service to the manufacturer. After public hearings, the Commission assigned the area of the proposed plant to the utility. The state supreme court later reversed that order. The cooperative sought damages for the time period when service was provided under the void order. The court affirmed the ruling in favor of the utility. Once the Commission issued its order, the utility was required to comply with it.

The trial court's nonenforcement of a provision of the antenuptial agreement did not result from a changed judicial interpretation of a statute. Accordingly, the nonenforcement was not an unconstitutional impairment of contract under either the state or federal constitutions. In support of its maintenance award, the trial court found that: (1) the wife suffered from a severe form of inflammatory neuropathy and was unable to work to support herself; (2) the wife had assets available for her support; (3) the wife's assets were not sufficient to provide for her support; and, (4) the antenuptial provision denying the wife maintenance should not have been enforced, because enforcing the provision would have left her unable to provide for her reasonable needs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-3-3 as applied to a co-conspirator awaiting his own trial, arguing that it deprived a witness of the right against self-incrimination. The court disagreed. The privilege against self-incrimination was not absolute, but was to be balanced with the government's legitimate demands to compel citizens to testify. The grant of immunity should leave the witness in substantially the same position as if the privilege to remain silent had been properly exercised. The court held that constitutional concerns were not raised by the mere fact that a witness had been compelled to testify. Rather, the constitutional violation occurred when the state used the compelled testimony against the witness. Furthermore, once the government initiated prosecution against the immunized witness, a pretrial hearing was the proper manner for challenging the state's compliance with the immunity grant. After a witness demonstrated that he or she had testified pursuant to a grant of immunity to matters related to the prosecution, the government had the burden of proving an independent, legitimate source for the disputed evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board approved a plan to construct a new school. The school board identified the landowners' property as a site. No offer to purchase was extended to the landowners. The landowners sought to enjoin the school board from condemning their property. The school board had not initiated condemnation proceedings. The landowners amended their complaint to include a tort claim arising from the threat of condemnation. The school board filed a motion to permit access to the landowners' property for soil testing. Before the trial court ruled, the school board withdrew its motion and informed the trial court that it was abandoning any interest in the property. The landowners filed a petition to recover the attorney's fees and expenses they had incurred pursuant to &sect; 8-23-17-27(a)(2). The trial court denied the landowners' petition for fees and expenses and entered summary judgment for the school board on the landowners' tort claim. The landowners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the school did not initiate a condemnation proceeding through its request for soil testing. However, the court found that the landowners' tort claim should have been dismissed without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

A breath test administered within three hours after a law enforcement officer had probable cause to believe defendant was driving with a BAC of at least .10 percent indicated defendant did, in fact, have at least a .10 percent BAC, and the trier of fact may have presumed the person's BAC at the time of the offense was at least .10 percent. A rational connection existed between the fact proved, that defendant had a BAC of at least .10 percent at the time the test was administered, and the ultimate fact presumed, that defendant had a BAC of at least .10 percent at the time he was driving, if the test was administered within three hours of driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by the State Lottery Commission of Indiana (Commission), the corporation was assessed treble damages and enjoined under the Indiana Civil Remedies for Racketeering Activity Act (Act), Ind.

On review the court held that any lottery conducted in Indiana or its promotion other than by the Commission was illegal. Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-5-6. Therefore, injunctive relief was appropriate without further showing of irreparable harm or the other elements usually required for an injunction. Second, the Commission was an aggrieved party under the Act and entitled to the injunction. Third, the state's gambling laws did not violate the Commerce Clause, both under the standard analysis for commerce clause issues and because Congress had made the corporation's plan illegal under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1301, which precluded judicial review. Furthermore, the state regulatory law was exempt from federal anti-trust laws, was an acceptable regulation of commercial free speech in protection of a substantial state interest, and did not violate the Contract Clause.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-48-4-6 (1993), failure to pay the Controlled Substance Excise Tax (CSET) under Ind. Code &sect; 6-7-3-11, and resisting a law enforcement officer in violation of Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been approached by police in the vicinity of an elementary school. He fled and discarded a plastic bag containing cocaine. Although defendant stipulated that the area he was in was school property, the State did not put that stipulation before the jury. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court reversed the conviction for possession within 1000 feet of school property because the State failed to present the stipulation or put forth any evidence that defendant was on school property. The court noted that the police officers testified that the property was a school but did not testify as to the property limits or indicate that the property fit within the statutory definition in &sect; 35-48-4-6. Although the CSET implicated the Double Jeopardy Clause because it could impose punishment subsequent to an underlying drug prosecution, the court held that it was constitutional based on state tax court precedent. The court noted that double jeopardy was not implicated in defendant's case as his prosecution for failure to pay the CSET was contemporaneous with his prosecution for the underlying drug offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board claimed that it had not exceeded the statutory limits of its authority when it established a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, that delegating authority to establish a rule setting the amounts of permit fees was well within its discretion, and that it had not violated Ind.

It also vacated the injunction that was entered against the board. The court said that the board had not acted beyond its statutorily delegated authority. Moreover, the board was established by the state in order to institute compliance with the federal Clean Water Act, and the state had the authority to grant power under Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a former employer and its safety director, challenged the order of the Superior Court of Tippecanoe County (Indiana) that granted a new trial of the issue of damages following a jury's finding that a former employee was wrongfully discharged by appellant former employer in retaliation for his refusal to violate the state maximum weight limit law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a personal representative of former employee's estate, filed a wrongful discharge action against appellants, a former employer and its safety director. It was alleged that the former employee, a truckdriver, was discharged in retaliation for his refusal to violate the state's statutory maximum weight limit. At trial, a jury awarded damages for wrongful discharge. Appellants filed a motion to correct trial errors pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 59(A)(2) and requested a remittitur of damages or a new trial. The superior court granted appellants' motion for a new trial. The court affirmed the jury's assessment of damages and reversed and remanded the superior court's judgment that ordered a new trial, holding that the new trial order was void because the order was entered outside the requisite period provided in Ind. R. Trial P. 53.3(D). The court found sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably have inferred that former employee's truck exceeded the state weight limit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the apartment of a husband and wife intending to rape the wife.

The husband was able to gain control of the gun, and defendant fled. Defendant was soon apprehended. A master commissioner presided at defendant's guilty plea hearing and at defendant's sentencing hearing. On appeal, defendant contended that his convictions were invalid because the commissioner presided over both hearings. The court ruled that, although it was error for the commissioner to preside at both hearings, defendant waived the error by presenting the issue for the first time on appeal. Without objecting to the commissioner's authority, defendant submitted to the commissioner's authority, and the commissioner's authority as de facto judge could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The court rejected defendant's claim that his plea was invalid because he was misinformed about his potential sentences.

The court affirmed, holding that by appellant's agent's act of signing the contract, appellant assented to the contract's terms and the trial court did not err in finding that there were no genuine issues as to any material fact and that appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The exculpatory clause was deemed valid and enforceable. Further, appellant did not demonstrate that it was an uninformed consumer dealing with a coercive fraudulent company, nothing in the designated matters demonstrated that appellee's contract was one that no sensible person not under delusion, duress or in distress would make, and that no honest and fair person would accept. The court concluded that there was no basis in the designated materials to conclude that appellee's exculpatory clause in the contract affected the public interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an applicant to be a candidate for sheriff, appealed from a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Indiana), which denied his request for a declaratory judgment that several Indiana election laws were unconstitutional. The applicant also appealed from the affirmance of the determination of defendant, the Montgomery County Election Board, that he was disqualified to be a candidate for the position of sheriff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Election Board decided the applicant was disqualified to be a candidate for public office pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 3-8-1-5 because he had been convicted of a felony. As a consequence, the Board refused to allow the applicant's name to be placed on the ballot for the primary election. Under the same cause number as the declaratory judgment action, the applicant filed a motion for judicial review of the Election Board's decision. The trial court affirmed the decision of the Election Board and denied the declaratory judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The State had a legitimate interest in the qualifications of candidates. The statute was not a special law because it applied to all applicants equally. No person who had been convicted of a felony was eligible. Ind. Const. art. II, &sect; 8 permitted disenfranchisement upon conviction of an infamous crime. Where a defendant might have been imprisoned for more than one year, his offense qualified as an infamous crime.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the State. On appeal, the court stated that defendant's possession and transport of .0573 grams of cocaine was not sufficient to have justified the forfeiture of his automobile. The court stated that the State had made no showing that defendant had used his vehicle in any way to transport cocaine for the purpose of committing the offense of possession. The court stated that while the presence of the cocaine residue in the tube was sufficient to have supported defendant's possession conviction, his possession of the substance in his automobile did not constitute transportation of cocaine for the purpose of possessing the drug. Ind. Code &sect; 34-4-30.1-1 did not support the divestiture of private property based on an insubstantial connection between the vehicle and the illegal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;This cause is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant officer was part of a SWAT team that raided a drug house during which a suspect was killed by a team member, and the officer first said the shooting was justified. Later he made inflammatory statements about the shooting as part of another officer's campaign for sheriff, and appellee Allen County Sheriff's Department Merit Board dismissed him. The Huntington Circuit Court (Indiana) affirmed the board's action, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer prepared a public statement about alleged police cover-ups of the shooting and the candidate for sheriff read it to the press during a news briefing. The board found that the officer violated five departmental rules of conduct, unbecoming conduct, immoral conduct, incompetence, abuse of process, and departmental reports. The circuit court found that the board's decision was based upon substantial evidence in the record. On appeal, the court noted that its review of administrative actions was limited to finding abuse of discretion or arbitrariness. While public employees did not abandon their First Amendment rights, under the Connick standard the speech was protected if it was on a matter of public concern and the employee's interest not outweighed by any injury the speech could cause to the interest of the state. The court found that the officer's speech was too disruptive of the police's authority and thus unprotected. The officer's actions deprived him of standing to challenge the department's rules on unbecoming and immoral conduct. The court found that the board's decision on incompetence and departmental reports was arbitrary and lacked reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, which had affirmed the action of the board, but only because the board's decisions on two of the five rules violations were arbitrary and capricious. The court remanded only for reconsideration of the appropriate level of discipline to be given to the officer and not for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made a motion for a speedy trial, and his trial was set within the speedy-trial period prescribed by Ind.

The state indicted defendant again, and defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge as time barred, which was denied. Defendant pled guilty. The court affirmed and held that even though the time limit did not start anew when the state dismissed and refiled the charge, defendant's request for a continuance meant he was charged with the time between the vacated and rescheduled trial dates. In addition, under Rule 4(B) the speedy-trial clock was stopped during the period between dismissal and refiling and began running again when new charges were filed. The tolling was not affected by defendant's incarceration on a prior conviction because his parole would have been revoked anyway. The court held that the trial court had the authority to accept defendant's guilty plea; thus, any possible speedy-trial violation was rendered moot. In addition, by pleading guilty defendant waived any right to a trial and, thereby, any right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-profit organizations were formed for charitable purposes and sought to obtain bingo licenses. On appeal, the department argued that the Act required an organization to operate in the state for at least five years before it could become &quot;qualified.&quot; The court found that in order for a charity to be a &quot;qualified organization,&quot; it did not need to be in existence in the state for a period of five years before becoming eligible for a bingo license under the Act. By limiting eligibility for bingo licenses to bona fide charities that have been continuously in existence in the state for at least five years, the statute excluded all similarly situated and equally worthy charities solely because they had previously been operating outside of the state. As such, it discriminated against interstate commerce, and the department had the burden of showing the statute served a &quot;legitimate local purpose&quot; which could not have been adequately served with nondiscriminatory alternatives. The department did not meet its burden. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee husband filed an action on behalf of his wife who was killed by appellant driver as she attempted to cross a road. A jury found in favor of appellee and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for a change of venue because Ind. R. Trial P. 76 violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. African-Americans comprised 25 percent of the general population of Lake County, whereas in each of the 3 counties to which the case might have been venued, African-Americans comprised less than 1 percent. Appellant's utilization of the automatic change of venue rule effectively operated as a strike against every potential African-American juror in Lake County. Although the court disagreed with the trial court's conclusion that there could never exist a race-neutral justification for the use of the automatic change of venue, the court held that appellant's mere denial of discriminatory intent was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was injured in an accident while a guest passenger in her step-father's car. Her medical bills were paid by her father's health insurance, which he obtained through the employer. The employer believed that it suffered a separate, compensable injury when it had to pay the injured party's medical bills, and brought suit against the step-father's estate. The court entered judgment in favor of the employer on its damage claim, but denied the employer's request for attorney fees. Both parties appealed. The court reversed, holding that by stating that the driver was not liable for those losses or damages that arose from injuries to enumerated passengers, Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1 precluded claims for &quot;loss or damage&quot; that originated from or had as their source &quot;injuries to&quot; the persons enumerated in &sect; 9-3-3-1, absent willful or wanton misconduct on the part of the driver. Therefore, the estate was not liable for the employer's damage claim which arose from the injuries that the injured party sustained as a result of the step-father's negligent driving. The court found that because the employer was no longer the prevailing party, the issue of attorney's fees was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with instructions to enter judgment rejecting the employer's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee quit his job after the employer announced that it was switching from a single driver to a team operation. The employee applied for unemployment benefits, which were denied by an administrative law judge and the board.

The court held that a failure to file an assignment of errors no longer deprived the appellate court jurisdiction, and did not prevent the court from exercising its inherent discretionary power to hear the merits of the case. The court reasoned that jurisdiction was conferred by the Indiana Constitution or by statute, not by a piece of paper. Although the employer did change employment conditions, the court could not say that a reasonable person would be compelled to conclude that the change rose to the level of good cause to quit or that the employer had terminated his employment. Because there was no evidence of a specific agreement that the employee was only to work as a single driver, a reasonable person would not be bound to find that the employer unilaterally changed employment conditions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction of criminal gang activity, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-9-1(B)(2), because the intra-group fighting and beatings constituted the felonious battery required as a condition of gang membership.

The circuit court did have the jurisdiction to order the panel chairman to form two striking panels. The circuit court did not violate its limited authority under the Act since it did not dictate the panel's opinions or interfere with its operations. Existing law held that the Act was constitutional. However, sufficient facts existed precluding judgment based largely on an affidavit of another doctor produced by the patient. The affidavit was valid even though it was not notarized. The affidavit also met the requirements of Ind. R. Trial P. 56(E) since it was based on personal knowledge, it set forth admissible facts, and it established the other doctor's expertise. The patient was not obligated to establish each element with expert opinion but only had to address the issues raised by the summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment was reversed and remanded since there were genuine issues of fact based on an affidavit that the doctor did not meet the standard of care. The other issues raised by the patient, including challenging the constitutionality of the Act, were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The husband argued that, without a hearing with 10 days notice, as required by Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.5-22, the trial court improperly considered the guardian's report. The court held that the parties' baby-sitting agreement did not bind the trial court if contrary to the best interests of the child. The agreement was inherently unworkable because it was impossible to discern from its terms exactly what circumstances triggered the provision.  Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.5-21(b) guaranteed the custodial parent the right to determine the course of the child's upbringing. Because the parties' child care agreement was not in the best interests of their child, the trial court was not bound by it.

The trial court issued a mandatory injunction against the landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner kept a large number of objects outside on his property, much of it rusted and inoperable. In response to complaints regarding the &quot;junk,&quot; the zoning board investigated and determined that the landowner was operating a junkyard in violation of the county's zoning ordinance. When entreaties to clean up the property failed, the zoning board filed an action for injunctive relief; the zoning board prevailed at the trial level, and the landowner appealed. The court held that certain items specified in the landowner's brief were not waste, valueless refuse, or fit only for recycling and therefore were not junk according to the definition adopted by the court. Some specified items were valuable antiques. The landowner was not required to comply with the zoning board's directive to license and keep operable the semi-trailers and vehicles found on the landowner's property or risk having them condemned as junk because such a requirement was not contained in the zoning ordinance, and the zoning board could not on an ad hoc basis impose a requirement not contained in the zoning ordinance. Items that were not specified in the landowner's brief were subject to the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' property was rezoned as a floodway by the commission and the landowners argued that such rezoning constituted a taking because the value of their real property had been diminished from $ 60,000 to $ 1000. The landowners subsequently instituted an inverse condemnation action against the commission and the trial court dismissed the landowners' complaint with prejudice. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court first noted that it would treat the dismissal with prejudice as a summary judgment for the commission. The court held that no cause of inverse condemnation could lie because the action was premature. The question of whether the zoning ordinance had &quot;gone too far&quot; and therefore constituted a taking hinged upon the economic impact of the rezoning. However, the landowners had not attempted to obtain a permit or a special exception and thus could not show that a final determination had been made that deprived them of all reasonable use of their property. That omission was critical because the economic impact could not be evaluated until a final determination regarding the possible uses of the property had been made. There was no error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which entered judgment in favor of the commission in the landowners' inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

More than five years after the last incident was alleged to have occurred, the State charged defendant. Defendant was found guilty and sentenced. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-4-2(a)(1) provided a five year statute of limitations but that Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-4-2(g)(1) tolled the statute of limitations if the accused lived out of state or concealed himself. The court found that under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13, the legislature could not enact a statute that fell disproportionately on some citizens. The court found that because defendant had fully cooperated with the investigation, the tolling provision of Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-4-2(g)(1) should not apply because defendant was always available for service of process. The court found that any other interpretation of the statute would not have a fair and substantial relation to the State's ability to bring that person to justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">IOSHA had determined that the employer was guilty of eight &quot;knowing&quot; violations and had ordered a $ 10,000 penalty for each. In reversing the decision, the trial court found that IOSHA had violated the employer's due process rights, and the finding was unsupported by the facts. On appeal, the court held that deference had to be given to IOSHA's interpretation of the statute. IOSHA's decision to look to the federal law in construing the statute, and in holding that the &quot;knowing&quot; requirement of the statute did not require a showing of bad motive, was well within its discretion. Thus, reversal on this basis was improper. The court also rejected the trial court's conclusion that the statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 22-8-1.1-27.1 was unconstitutionally vague, because it only involved the classification of penalties, and did not prohibit any particular conduct. However, the trial court properly reversed seven of the eight violations, because the IOSHA order cited a federal regulation which did not apply to the employer. The eighth violation was unsupported by any evidence. Thus, the trial court did not err in reversing the order.</SPAN></P>

The court found that that the warrantless police search of defendants' trash did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the garbage containers were placed in defendants' driveway approximately one foot from the street, which was readily accessible to the public. The court found that an individual wishing to rummage through the contents of the containers would not have needed to step onto defendants' property to do so, thus the police could not reasonably have been expected to avert their eyes from the incriminating evidence. The court found the motion to suppress was properly denied because an independent magistrate properly found probable cause to issue the search warrant in contention and the police officers reasonably relied on the warrant's validity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant belonged to a gang in which he was the second in command. As part of an initiation ritual, defendant participated in the beating of two boys who wanted to become members. Defendant was convicted of violating Indiana's Criminal Gang Activity Statute (gang statute) for committing battery on one of the boys. The issue on appeal was whether the gang statute was constitutional under the United States and Indiana Constitutions. In his appeal, defendant argued that the gang statute was unconstitutional, that the trial court erred in allowing a police officer to testify as to the history of defendant's gang under the pedigree exception to the rule against hearsay, and that the gang statute did not apply to his conduct. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the trial court's erroneous admission of the officer's testimony of the gang's history under the pedigree exception was harmless and that the gang statute passed constitutional muster. Its prohibitions included a battery committed by one gang member on another consenting gang member.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment holder had knowledge of a decedent's death because his attorney and the judgment holder communicated about the fact that an estate might be opened. The personal representative failed to give the judgment holder notice under Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-7-7. The judgment holder filed a claim over one year after the decedent's death. On motion by the personal representative, the trial court disallowed the judgment holder's claim on the ground that it was barred by the one-year limitation period in &sect; 29-1-7-7(e). On appeal, the court reversed because the knowledge of the decedent's attorney of the judgment holder's claim was imputed to the personal representative. Thus, his failure to give actual notice of the opening of the estate contravened &sect; 29-1-7-7. However, because there was a fact question as to whether the judgment holder was prevented from filing its claim because of the imputed actions of the attorney the matter was remanded to the trial court to determine if the one-year time limitation should be extended.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's child was found to be in need of services and was placed in foster care.

However, the mother married him. The CASA and DPW filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights. The trial court granted the petition. The court held that the conditions resulting in the child's removal from the mother's home would not be remedied, and termination of the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests. The CASA acted within the statutory parameters of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 31-6-1-12 when she took measures to pursue the termination of the mother's parental rights. There was evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding that the mother's boyfriend presented a threat to the child's emotional well being and that he would present a physical threat to the child. There was also evidence in the record to support the finding that the child's safety in the mother's home could be ensured, if at all, only with long-term counseling.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was then taken to the police station where a breath test was administered using an Intoxilyzer. A test result of .10 percent blood alcohol was recorded. On appeal, defendant contended that the police did not have probable cause to stop him and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court rejected the probable cause argument, noting that police officers were authorized to stop speeding vehicles. However, the court reversed defendant's conviction because it found that defendant's evidence demonstrated that a reading of .10 percent blood alcohol content could have been rounded up from a lesser blood alcohol content and, thus, the evidence of a .10 percent reading did not establish that defendant's blood-alcohol content was at least .10 percent when he was operating the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' directors had filed a separate declaratory judgment action, which was consolidated with plaintiffs' appeal. The lower court certified each denial of cross-motions for summary judgment for interlocutory appeal. The appellate court affirmed the lower court's denial of plaintiffs' summary judgment because plaintiffs did not demonstrate that any legislation prohibited the use of the exclusion or that the companies were required to maintain expansive directors and officers liability insurance policies. The court reversed the denial of appellant's motion for summary judgment because the exclusion in the policies unambiguously applied to exclude coverage for the liquidators' claims in both lawsuits, and the exclusion was not contrary to public policy.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant convicted by a jury of dealing in cocaine and adjudicated a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the State failed to overcome his defense of entrapment. The court determined that the State sufficiently rebutted the defense of entrapment. The evidence that defendant quoted prices and quantities demonstrated his understanding of drug terminology. Defendant also demonstrated his familiarity with suppliers and an understanding of how the drug market worked. The court also determined that defendant failed to show that his counsel was ineffective because he did not establish that he was prejudiced by his counsel's performance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city discovered that it had miscalculated the number of pay periods in its 1988 budget.

The employees filed an action against defendants, alleging that defendants wrongfully withheld wages and sought collection of the wages for the unbudgeted period. The trial court granted judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment for the employees who were paid hourly and affirmed the decision for the employees who were paid a salary. The court held that salaried employees' wages were the amount agreed upon to be paid for the entire year, and as long as that amount was tendered over the course of the year, the number of pay periods was irrelevant. However, the wages earned by an hourly employee represented the work performed during the pay period, and thus hourly employees were entitled to wages for the unbudgeted pay period. The court also held that the city's decision to not pay for the unbudgeted period did not violate Ind. Const. art. I &sect;&sect; 21, 24, and 27 or Ind. Code &sect; 22-2-5-1.</SPAN></P>

She was advised that he was being taken into protective custody. She filed her complaint. Because of a holiday weekend, nearly 156 hours passed before a post-detention hearing was held in response to the DPW's petition for temporary custody. The son was returned to the mother under DPW's supervision. She claimed that due process required that a detention hearing be held within 48 hours, including holidays and weekends, of a child's removal from his parent's custody. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that the constitutionality of the detention statute was not moot even though the DPW's petition had been dismissed. The detention statute, Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-4-6(e) provided that a hearing had to be held with 72 hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays, after a child had been taken into custody. The court found that between &sect; 31-6-4-6(e) and Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-4-4(c), an adequate balance between the need of the child to be protected and the parent's right to have custody was maintained. The detention statute met the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment for DPW in the mother's action for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The councilman sought a declaratory judgment that he could remain on the county council, and the trial court concluded that the councilman was properly disqualified. The councilman appealed, alleging that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 3-8-1-5(3)(B) was not unconstitutional because it was reasonably necessary to accomplish the legitimate objective of disqualification. The statute was not an ex post facto law because the legislature's aim in enacting the statute was not to punish past activities but to regulate elected officials based upon their general characteristics, including trustworthiness. The councilman's disqualification did not constitute improper disenfranchisement because each of the councilman's convictions was a felony which was punishable by imprisonment for a term of years and therefore was an infamous crime.</SPAN></P>

The court then held that the property owners were estopped from contesting the validity of the ordinance sections at issue because they had previously applied for a permit pursuant to the ordinances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county department of public welfare took the children away from the mother because she used crack cocaine. The physical and mental conditions of the children were seriously impaired as a result of her inability to supply the children with food, clothing, shelter, medical care, education, or supervision. The mother contended that Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-5-4(c)(2) was unconstitutional on its face because it required a standard lower than clear and convincing evidence to grant a petition to terminate parental rights. Upon review, the court found that the statute required the department to show that there was a reasonable probability, by clear and convincing evidence, that the conditions resulting in the children's removal would not have been remedied. There was sufficient evidence to support the termination of the mother's parental rights. She failed to regularly attend counseling and narcotics anonymous meetings. She frequently missed her scheduled visitation with the children and was not able to provide them with a stable home. She had no steady employment. The mother showed a total lack of commitment on her part to have the children returned to her care.</SPAN></P>

A bench trial was held where defendant renewed his objection to the evidence obtained in the search. The trial court found defendant guilty and he appealed. The court affirmed his conviction, holding that the police officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for public intoxication and took him into custody due to his arrest. By reason of defendant's arrest, the police officer had a right and a duty to impound his car. The court held that the police officer's inventory search of an impounded car pursuant to established police caretaking procedures constituted an exception to the federal and Indiana constitutional requirement that the police search and seize property under a warrant. The court further held that it could not say that the police officer's expectation of what he would find in the inventory searched changed the nature of that search.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with and convicted of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 9-30-5-1. The court affirmed, holding that there was no error in instructing the jury on the results and accuracy of the breathalyzer test, and that the law providing a presumption that blood alcohol levels were .10 percent while driving if they were at lease .10 percent when measured was not unconstitutional. Further, these laws did not violate defendant's right to confrontation, as it would be impractical to have a toxicologist present to testify as to the accuracy of the machine and the competence of the test administrator, and copies of certificates of inspection were admissible. Moreover, the jury could rely on the presumption that his blood alcohol was at least .10 percent while driving because the test was taken within three hours, and he offered no rebuttal evidence.

The company filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the trial court, naming as respondents the common council and the City. The City filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the petition for lack of presentment on the grounds that the company failed to meet its burden of strict compliance with the statutory requirements for review of the complained of decision. The company appealed. The court held that although the company fulfilled its statutory obligation to &quot;present&quot; its petition, inasmuch as the petition was filed in open court, the company's petition was nevertheless appropriately dismissed for lack of proper verification and notice. The company's petition was not verified by an executive or administrative officer of the company, the actual &quot;person aggrieved,&quot; as required by Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-1003. The evidence also showed that the company did not comply with Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-1005 by failing to notify three property owners, who were adversary parties necessary and indispensable to the proceeding, of the hearing. As such, dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father asserted that he could not be ordered to pay support and college expenses under the Paternity Statute when there was no actual controversy regarding paternity. Specifically, he maintained that a trial court did not have jurisdiction over a paternity dispute when there was no real controversy regarding paternity. The court noted that the purpose of the Paternity Statute was to vest the father with the rights and responsibilities of parenthood, not merely to establish the fact of parenthood. The father had no real basis for complaint when he was judged to be what he freely admitted he was, the father of the daughter, and was then called upon to fulfill his non-custodial parental support obligations. The court also concluded that the daughter had standing to bring the paternity action against the father under Ind.

The trial court denied appellants' motion to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings, but granted their motion for interlocutory appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleading in the wrongful death action, holding that the issue of whether a special duty arose could not be resolved upon a motion to dismiss or a motion for judgment on the pleadings and that the executrix met her pleading burden by alleging the elements of negligence. However, the court reversed the trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss or for judgment on the pleading on the executrix's &sect; 1983 claim and remanded with instructions to grant either motion in favor of appellants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a decision of the Jasper Superior Court (Indiana), which dismissed their proposed medical malpractice claim against appellee doctors and clinic before the Indiana Department of Insurance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged that appellees committed medical malpractice by negligently diagnosing, treating, and caring for one of appellant's lower back problem. The alleged negligence occurred on or around February 12, 1984. Appellants requested and received an extension of time and a new submission schedule was set with appellants to submit their materials by May 1, 1991, and appellees to submit their materials by June 10, 1991, to the panel. Four days before the panel was to hear the case, appellant's attorney mailed his submission. Consequently, it did not arrive and the panel dismissed the claim. The court held that neither the failure of an appellee to come forward with evidence, nor the failure of the panel to render an opinion, was an impediment to sanctioning the complainant. The court held that dismissal was an appropriate sanction under Ind. Code &sect; 16.9.5-9.5(b). The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in utilizing this remedy for appellants' failure to comply with the evidentiary schedule set up by the panel chair, especially after repeated requests to submit such evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient suffered injuries at work that were treated by the medical center. The worker's compensation insurance carrier partially paid the medical center bill, and disputed its remainder. The medical center brought this lawsuit to collect the balance due from the patient. The court affirmed the trial court decision granting the patient's motion to dismiss. The court found appellate attorney fees appropriate, but remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing on their appropriateness. The trial court correctly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction because it was the improper forum when the medical center failed to exhaust its administrative remedies pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-1-2. The application of Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-3-5, which governed the issue of financial liability for medical treatment, was an issue that should have been directed to the Worker's Compensation Board (board). The trial court award of attorney fees to the patient for trial under Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-32-1(b)(1) was in its discretion because the medical center's complaint was &quot;frivolous&quot; when its attorney failed to discover that the board was the proper forum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died testate, leaving all of her net estate to her niece by marriage and also naming her executrix of the estate. Nearly a year after the will was probated, the decedent's natural niece challenged the will, alleging fraud, duress, and lack of capacity. The trial court granted the executrix' motion to dismiss the heir's complaint because it was not filed within five months after the will was probated pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-7-17. The heir contended that the executrix fraudulently failed to notify her of their aunt's death, and that the time limitation therefore did not apply. The heir also argued that because she would be entitled to an intestate distribution if the will were set aside, her right to contest the will was a property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed the dismissal by the trial court, finding that the statute did not require notice of the testate probate proceeding be given to an heir who would take under intestate succession. The court ruled that the notice statute was not unconstitutional because the heir's mere expectancy interest as an intestate heir was not a property right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a verbal altercation, defendant physically assaulted his wife. He was tried and convicted on a charge of battery, a Class A misdemeanor under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-3. The trial court sentenced defendant to 1-year incarceration with 255 days suspended. Defendant was placed on probation for one year following his incarceration, with six months of the probation to be served under home detention. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that (1) defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he did not establish that but for his counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different and because the court would not second guess counsel's trial tactics and strategy; and (2) improper comments by the prosecutor did not deprive defendant of a fair trial because the evidence against defendant was not close and he did not show that the persuasive effect on the jury placed him in grave peril. The court held that, while &sect; 35-50-3-1 permitted the trial court to impose a term of probation of up to one year regardless of whether the term exceeded a suspended sentence, the home detention order failed to comply with &sect; 35-38-2.5-6.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-48-4-1, possession of cocaine under Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6, and resisting law enforcement under Ind. Code &sect; 35-44-3-3. He appealed the convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant set up a cocaine sale with an undercover informant. The informant gave the signal to police cars to follow defendant's car. One officer turned on her emergency lights, and defendant fled. After a high-speed chase defendant was arrested. No drugs were found in the car, but after a search along the route a bag with the cocaine was found. On cross-examination of the State's key witness, the informant, the trial judge sustained the State's objection to the question regarding the witness's address. The trial judge did not conduct an in-camera hearing regarding the relevance of the address. On appeal, the court held that the failure to conduct an in-camera hearing was reversible error. Defendant was precluded from conducting his cross-examination of the key witness. The trial court committed harmless error when it responded to the jury's question during deliberations without defendant being present. Defendant's counsel was present. The error was harmless because the trial court denied the jury's request to replay testimony in an effort to determine the exact location of the officer when she engaged her emergency lights during the chase. Defendant suffered no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dealing and possession charges and remanded for a new trial. It affirmed the conviction on the charge of resisting law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The massage parlor was operating on property under which there was a zoning ordinance, which prohibited the establishment of any adult entertainment business within 500 feet of a residential district. The commission filed an action to enforce the ordinance against the massage parlor. The trial court granted the commission permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting the massage parlor from operating on the property pursuant to the ordinance. The massage parlor appealed, claiming that the commission was guilty of laches, that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, and that its use of the premises was a lawful pre-existing non-conforming use. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that public policy interests prohibited the massage parlor as a private party from asserting the doctrine of laches against a municipality seeking to enforce its zoning ordinances. The court concluded that the evidence did not establish that the use of the premises prior to the passage of the ordinance was lawful. Finally, the ordinance survived a constitutional vagueness challenge because the commission established that the term &quot;massage parlor&quot; had a sufficiently precise meaning to the average person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed a jury instruction was misleading and inadequate because it failed to advise the jury to convict only upon finding that he was subjectively aware of a high probability that he exposed his dependent to a danger which was both actual and appreciable. The court reversed and remanded and held that the neglect statute was construed to apply only to situations where the placement of the dependent exposed the dependent to a danger which was &quot;actual and appreciable&quot; inasmuch as the statutory phrase &quot;may endanger&quot; was unduly vague. Repetition of the statutory language of Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-4(a)(1), unaccompanied by other instruction, allowed conviction upon a less definite degree of proof than was necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness. Additionally, the jury was instructed that the State could meet its burden of proof by showing that the defendant placed the victim in a situation that might have endangered the life and health of the victim. However, the State had the burden of proving that the dependent's life or health was placed in actual, appreciable danger by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working at the employer's farming operation, which was an agricultural enterprise.

The court held that exemption of agricultural employees was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the state or federal constitution. The classification that excluded agricultural employees was rationally related to furthering legitimate state interests in protecting the farming economy. The agricultural employee failed to meet his burden of showing that the statute was unconstitutional. The court noted that injured agricultural employees were not left without legal recourse, but could bring common law negligence actions for damages against their employers.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-45-1-3(2) and public intoxication in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 7.1-5-1-3. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the disorderly conduct statute under the Ind. Const. art I, &sect; 9, and under the U.S. Const. amend. I and amend. XIV. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the statute was neither overbroad nor void for vagueness, and the &quot;unreasonable noise&quot; provision of &sect; 35-45-1-3(2) was constitutional with respect to fighting words, speech inciting imminent lawless action, and public nuisance speech. The court noted that when the utterance was alleged to be fighting words, the circumstances had to present additional indicia of serious provocation likely to incite even a police officer to an immediate and violent reaction and the &quot;unreasonable noise&quot; language of the statute did not vest the police with unwarranted discretion to suppress protected speech. The court also held that, for purposes of &sect; 7.1-5-1-3, a street was a public place and a non-expert could offer an opinion as to the defendant's intoxication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and port authority, appealed a judgment from the Porter Superior Court (Indiana), which declared its ordinance requiring plaintiffs, marine owners and other boaters, to pay an annual license fee of $ 75 per dock slip to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Marina owners and other boaters filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their complaint alleged that the $ 75.00 annual license fee imposed by the city's ordinance for use of a dock and waterway was contrary to Ind. Code &sect; 36-1-3-8. The trial court agreed and entered judgment in their favor, declaring the ordinance void, after finding that the ordinance was unrelated to the costs of regulation and therefore, was an impermissible revenue tax. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that while the city had the authority under &sect; 36-1-3-4(b) to authorize a license fee for the use of the waterway, the fee imposed upon the boaters and other users was not reasonably related to the administrative costs of exercising its regulatory power. The court further held that trial court's special findings of fact entered under Ind. R. Trial P. 52(A), specifically, that the monies collected through the enforcement of the ordinance would not be limited to the probable expense of issuing licenses and inspecting and regulating boating activity, had support in the record and were not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which had declared the city's ordinance void and held that the license fee that was not reasonably related to the administrative costs of exercising the city's regulatory power.</SPAN></P>
