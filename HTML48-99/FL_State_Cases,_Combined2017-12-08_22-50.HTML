<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an application for review of the decision of the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) which found that 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-182 violated the single subject rule found in the Fla. Const. art. III &sect; 6. Defendant claimed that ch. 95-182 violated the single subject rule and sought to have the trial court precluded from sentencing her under ch. 95-182.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three criminal offenses.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.084 (1995). The version of &sect; 775.084 applicable in the defendant's case had been amended by the passage of 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 95-182, which created the violent career criminal sentencing category for certain criminal offenders. The defendant filed a motion to preclude the trial court from sentencing her as a violent career criminal and to declare unconstitutional ch. 95-182, claiming that the chapter law violated the single subject rule of the Fla. Const. art. III &sect; 6. The court determined that ch. 95-182 was violative of the single subject rule because the various sections of 95-182 addressed two different subjects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, convicted of DUI manslaughter, claimed on appeal that the trial court erred in utilizing a standard jury instruction and not the special requested instruction containing a negligence element.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the DUI manslaughter standard jury instruction should not be modified to include a negligence element. They also found that the improper admission of prior bad acts evidence of a deadly accident, was harmful error. The court found that respondent's past driving record was of marginal, if any, relevance in establishing the elements of DUI manslaughter. Because the court was unable to conclude that the improper admission of this unfairly prejudicial evidence was harmless, they held that respondent was entitled to a new trial on this basis. Additionally, the court approved of the holding in Melvin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This application for review, a consolidation of two cases, one from the Fourth District, the other from the First district, seeks clarification of decisions of the District Court of Appeal, Florida, both certifying the same question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicants for review questioned whether in appeals not involving constitutional error, did the enactment of Florida Stat. ch. 924.051(7) (1996) abrogate the harmless error analysis in case law? The Fourth District, on appeal, held &quot;bad neighborhood&quot; testimony was not &quot;constitutional error.&quot; Instead finding defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating &quot;prejudicial error&quot; pursuant to Florida Stat. ch. 924.051(7) (1996). In the other case, the trial court allowed the introduction of &quot;collateral crimes evidence&quot; over defendant's objection. The first district affirmed, based on section 924.051(7), but certified the identical question for this court's review. By limiting the certified question to appeals not involving &quot;constitutional error,&quot; a term not utilized in the statute, the first and fourth Districts, as well as the state, acknowledged that in cases of constitutional error, state appellate courts were bound by the harmless error standard enunciated in case law. Question answered in the negative on review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Question answered in the negative. Reviewing the record, ascertaining whether an error is harmless, is essential appellate function, shifting burden to defendant abdicates judicial responsibility, could lead to unjust results of affirming conviction where appellate court not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that error did not affect the defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, Florida Senate and Senate President, sought writ of mandamus ordering the Florida Secretary of State to expunge the gubernatorial veto directed at portions of the proviso language of the 1999-2000 General Appropriations Act, ch. 99-226, Laws of Florida. Respondent governor vetoed only the operations grants portion of a prolonged school year program. That proviso did not expressly state the amount of funds assigned to the operations grants, but included a formula for calculating the grants. The court found respondent could have vetoed the whole appropriation for the program but could not separate out operations component from the appropriation. The veto was unconstitutional. Respondent cross-petitioned, contending that the operations grants funding formula unconstitutionally amended the statutory funding process of the Florida Education Finance Program. The court found since there were no direct and immediate adverse effects, recourse was in suit for declaratory decree in circuit court, not in mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's request for writ of mandamus granted and respondent's request denied because mandamus was not proper remedy for his cross-petition.

Both defendants were sentenced to death. On appeal, the defendant raised several issues claiming error in both the guilt and penalty phases. In affirming the convictions, the court found no error in admissions of his confession, or of other testimony; the jury's inadvertent view of the defendant in handcuffs also did not warrant reversal; and the defendant waived any objection to the court's disallowance of his peremptory challenge. However, his absence during a critical stage of the penalty phase without a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to be present resulted in an unfair penalty phase proceeding, so the death penalty was vacated, and the court remanded for a new penalty phase proceeding before a new jury.</SPAN></P>

The defendant appealed this finding of fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of attempted aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery. After the finding of guilt, Plaintiff state moved to have defendant declared a gang member for penalty enhancement purposes pursuant to Fla. Stat. &sect; 874.04. Defendant opposed the motion, asserting that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court denied defendant's constitutional challenge to the statute, found defendant to be a criminal street gang member, and stated that defendant's third-degree felony and misdemeanor would be enhanced. The appellate court determined that Fla. Stat. &sect; 874.04 was unconstitutional, and plaintiff state appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was unconstitutional as a violation of substantive due process. The court held that Fla. Stat. &sect; 874.04 violated defendant's substantive due process rights because the statute subjected defendant to conviction for a higher degree crime than originally charged, resulting in an increased penalty range, based only upon defendant's simple association with others, who may or may not have been criminals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In compliance with Fla. Const. art. XI &sect; 3, court issued advisory opinion, which was a prerequisite to a ballot initiative, that a citizens' initiative petition with respect to term limits dealt with only one subject. Voters passed this initiative. State constitution was amended to limit number of consecutive terms of office for state and federal officials. Three years later, United States Supreme Court held that state attempts to restrict candidacy for U.S. Congress violated the U.S. Const. amend. X. Appellants argued that amendment's compliance with single-subject requirement mandated that entire amendment be stricken. Court concluded that unconstitutional provisions with respect to federal legislators were severable. Amendment remained viable because it accomplished its purpose of limiting political terms of state officeholders. Court declined to revisit its prior advisory opinion that amendment satisfied single-subject requirement. Court found amendment constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court denied his amended Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion, defendant sought review. On appeal, the court held defense counsel could not be deemed ineffective for failing to object to jury instructions, which merely inquired whether jury members could follow the law. The court affirmed in part because the state correctly conceded the need for an evidentiary hearing for issues raised as to defendant's mental competency, the adequacy of competency examinations, and the adequacy of counsel's representation for the mental issues. The court reversed in part to require an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel claims, mental competence claims, public records request, and because a factual dispute remained as to whether counsel was ineffective for failing to discover evidence as to defendant's mental history. The court found that defendant alleged sufficient facts about the existence of this mitigation and counsel's failure to investigate or present it that were not refuted by the record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgment of the Lee County Circuit Court (Florida), entered upon a jury verdict, and even though he was only 16 years old at the time of the offenses, convicted him of first-degree murder and robbery and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death for first-degree murder and robbery, notwithstanding mitigating factors that included the fact that he was only 16 years old at the time of the offenses. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed but the death sentence reversed and reduced to life imprisonment. The court ruled that the convictions were supported by sufficient evidence and allowing a medical examiner to testify as to the cause of death of one victim, even though she had not performed the autopsy, was not an abuse of discretion because the witness made independent conclusions using objective evidence, including the autopsy records. In addition, statements made by a codefendant in defendant's presence were admissible as admissions by acquiescence. However, imposition of the death penalty upon a defendant who was 16 years of age at the time of the offense was cruel or unusual punishment, under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, and was disproportionate with respect to sentences in other cases. In addition, the scheme set out in Fla. Stat. &sect; 985.225 (1997), which provided that juveniles were subject to the death penalty, was suspect under the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed, but the sentence reversed because, although, inter alia, the convictions were supported by sufficient evidence and admission of expert testimony by a medical examiner who had not performed the autopsy; admissions by acquiescence was proper; and the imposition of the death penalty for a crime committed when a defendant was 16 years of age constituted cruel or unusual punishment under the Florida constitution.</SPAN></P>

There was at most harmless error if due process was violated by the refusal to require production of condition and operation records due to the numerous recent reviews. A PET scan, 17 years after the murders took place and after defendant's counsel testified that defendant remembered the murders, would not produce probative evidence of defendant's mental state at the time of the murders, and was procedurally barred as an abuse of process.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court summarily denied his motion for postconviction relief filed under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, defendant appealed. On appeal, the court found several claims to have been procedurally barred because they were raised on direct appeal. The court affirmed on most issues, but reversed in part the trial court's summary order on defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion and remanded to hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court disagreed with the trial court's denial of defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim arising from trial counsel's status as a deputy sheriff. The court found several claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel legally and facially sufficient to warrant relief despite the failure to raise an appropriate objection or otherwise preserve the issues for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, defendant failed to demonstrate his attorneys' performance was deficient at trial or that the alleged deficiencies rendered the result unreliable, including failure to present certain mental mitigation evidence.

The appellate court held that it did and upheld a grant of summary judgment to respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation conveyed land to a county, which in turn conveyed it to a city airport board, which then conveyed it to respondent. As a result of the original transfer, part of the land retained by corporation became both water- and landlocked. The parties agreed that an implied common law way of necessity over respondent's property was created. However, no notice of a claim to such a way of necessity was ever filed in the public records or asserted by use. Petitioner acquired the remaining land and thereafter filed suit asserting that with its acquisition it also acquired the right to a way of necessity across respondent's land. The appellate court affirmed a grant of summary judgment to respondent but certified the question of whether the Marketable Record Title Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 712, operated to extinguish an otherwise valid claim of a common law way of necessity when such claim was not asserted within 30 years. The court answered in the affirmative and affirmed. The court held that because petitioner's predecessor in title failed to use or record its way of necessity or assert it in any way, MRTA mandated extinguishment of the interest in favor of respondent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the affirmative and affirmed the lower court's decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county appealed a decision of the District Court of Appeal for the Third District (Florida), which determined that the Legislature expressed clear intent to retroactively apply Fla. Stat. ch. 376.3078(3) and (9) because of the comprehensive nature of the Dry Cleaning Contamination Cleanup Act, the fact that the statute applied to contamination that occurred prior to its enactment, and the absence of a savings clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county sued defendants, who had leased space to dry cleaning establishments, to recover costs expended in investigating and addressing contamination allegedly caused by drycleaning solvents. Plaintiff also sought an injunction to compel containment of on-site and off-site contamination. Defendants moved for summary judgment claiming immunity under Fla. Stat. ch. 376.3078 of the Dry Cleaning Contamination Cleanup Act (Act) Defendants' motions were granted and the appellate court affirmed but certified the question as to whether the immunity provisions applied retroactively. The court answered the certified question in the affirmative, finding that because the statute provided conditional immunity from liability for contamination occurring before the statute's enactment, the immunity provisions operated retroactively. The court held that a consideration of both the express terms of the Act and its purpose demonstrated that the Legislature intended the immunity provisions to protect entities from suits to recover the costs of rehabilitation even if those costs were incurred before the Act went into effect, as long as the entities were eligible under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's decision was approved and the question of the retroactivity of the Dry Cleaning Contamination Cleanup Act (Act) was answered in the affirmative because the Legislature clearly expressed its intent through the language of the statute as well as the structure and purpose of the Act to apply the immunity provisions found in the statute to preclude plaintiff's lawsuit to recover its rehabilitation costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first-degree murder despite his claim of self-defense. The trial testimony conflicted as to whether defendant or victim fired the first shot. The jury convicted defendant and, by a vote of 10 to two, recommended a death sentence. After finding aggravating circumstances and few mitigating circumstances, the trial judge sentenced defendant to death. In his sentencing order, the trial judge expressly relied on testimony of a witness as to which shot was fired first. On postconviction, the lower court denied defendant's claim that the state failed to disclose Brady material relating to the testimony of the witnesses as a whole on the issue of which gun was fired first. The court reversed and remanded for a new sentencing hearing, finding that although the alleged Brady violation was not material as to defendant's conviction, it was material to the sentence of death. The court found defendant was not entitled to a self-defense argument on his conviction for felony murder but the evidence as to who shot first was specifically considered by the judge in imposing the death sentence such that the state was obligated to disclose the material cited by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's order was reversed because it erred in limiting the scope of a postconviction evidentiary hearing so as to exclude review of exculpatory evidence that should have been disclosed pretrial. Because of the substance of the Brady information, the court remanded for a new sentencing proceeding before a jury. The discovery sought by defendant was not material as to defendant's conviction but was material as to the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant governor, sought review of the decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) which declared unconstitutional&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ch. 447.203(3)(j) (1997). That statute prohibited those persons who by virtue of their positions of employment were regulated by the Florida Supreme Court, from engaging in collective bargaining with their government employer .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed an action seeking declaration that Fla. Stat. ch. 447.203(3)(j) (1997) was unconstitutional. The lower court struck down the statute concluding that it unconstitutionally infringed upon the right of government lawyers to bargain collectively. On appeal, the court found that those government agencies that allowed collective bargaining had not suffered any adverse impact from such collective bargaining. In affirming the lower court, the court held the state did not demonstrate that a blanket ban on collective bargaining by public employees working as attorneys was the least onerous means of protecting the attorney-client relationships between the lawyers and the public entities which employed them. Evidence of collective bargaining procedures in other jurisdictions showed that collective bargaining procedures could be fashioned to accommodate both the public employers' interests in assuring fidelity and competence in their attorneys and the attorneys' constitutional right as public employees to bargain collectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court which held Fla. Stat. ch. 447.203(3)(j) (1997) to be unconstitutional, because the state had failed to prove the requisite necessity for a wholesale ban on collective bargaining by government lawyers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a second motion for postconviction relief which included claims for noncompliance with a public records request, withholding of material, exculpatory evidence, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court summarily denied the motion, without holding an evidentiary hearing, ruling that appellant's claims were either conclusively refuted by the record or procedurally barred. The trial court's order was affirmed on appeal. The trial court was found to have not abused its discretion in denying appellant's motion for production or for an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 on that point based on appellee state's and the sheriffs office's assertions that all documents had been provided to collateral counsel and because there was an absence of any colorable claim that handwritten police notes existed and were being withheld as claimed by appellant. Appellant's contentions that appellee continued to withhold material, exculpatory evidence and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel were found to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court (Florida) in and for Alachua County, in an action by appellant for a complaint of bond validation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a county government, imposed a monthly fee on electric utilities for the privilege of using county rights-of-way to deliver electricity. The ordinance contained a pass-through provision, making the fee a debt of the electric utility customer to the electric utility. The ordinance allowed an electric utility to retain 1 percent of the monthly fee for &quot;collecting and transmitting&quot; the Privilege Fee to the county, which used the revenue for county operations. The ordinance also provided for issuance and sale of bonds for financing of &quot;various capital improvement projects,&quot; to be paid by a pledge of the revenue flowing from the Privilege Fee. In order to avoid having the Privilege Fee declared an unconstitutional tax, the county argued that the fee was a reasonable rental fee, a user fee, or a franchise fee. The trial court ruled that the Privilege Fee was an unconstitutional tax and that the bond was therefore invalid. The court held that if the Privilege Fee (or fee) was a tax, it was unconstitutional and void. Because revenue was used to provide general tax relief the use of the fee indicated that it was an unlawful tax that no general law authorized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the &quot;Privilege Fee&quot; was not a rental fee, as it did not represent a bargained-for agreement between the county and any electric utility. It was unilaterally imposed upon the electric utilities by the county. The county gave nothing up in exchange for the Fee. The Privilege Fee was an unconstitutional tax and the bond was, therefore, invalid.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied the request for authorization and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the lower court's decision holding that the fee was not a valid special assessment or fee, but rather an impermissible tax, and that it conflicted with the ad valorem taxation scheme enacted by the legislature. The court noted that the fee was enacted only to offset the delay in payment of ad valorem taxes and that the fee had all the indicia of a tax in that it did not confer a specific benefit on the land burdened by the assessment. Therefore, the lower court's decision not to validate the revenue certificates was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of killing two people over a car purchase dispute. Appellant sought review and asserted the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, and other issues regarding his sentence. On review, the court held that the motion for acquittal was properly denied. The appellant merely submitted a boilerplate motion for acquittal without fully setting forth the specific grounds upon which the motion was based. In any event, upon review of the record, the court found no error. The court found no error in the trial court's denial of the motion for new trial even thought appellant claimed newly discovered evidence of innocence. This was because a new witness produced by appellant had several inconsistencies and lacked credibility and because appellant failed to carry his burden to demonstrate that this testimony would have changed the result of the trial. However, the court reversed the death sentence. This was because, under a proportionality review, the facts mitigated the sentence of death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county purchased a residential mobile home lot through eminent domain for a road improvement project. The lot was subject to a restrictive covenant that required the owner of the lot to pay a monthly recreational fee in exchange for the right to use the recreational facilities of appellee country club. Appellee filed an inverse condemnation action against appellant contending that appellant took from it a property right. Appellant contended that having to pay the recreational fee placed an intolerable burden on the county and the public to compensate owners of such restrictions. The lower courts found for appellee. On review, the court held that, under U.S. Const. amend. V, a restrictive covenant imposed a duty which ran with the land taken which constituted a compensable interest. A restrictive covenant was generally deemed a property right under federal law. Therefore, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An application for review of a decision in direct conflict with another decision was filed from the District Court of Appeal (Florida), on the issue of whether zoned use of land was, as a matter of law, determinative of the actual, good faith, agricultural use of the land for ad valorem tax assessment purposes under Fl. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(a) and Fl. Stat. &sect; 193.461(3)(b) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision of the lower court which conflicted with existing case law was granted review on the issue of whether zoned use of land was, as a matter of law, determinative of the actual, good faith agricultural use of the land for ad valorem tax assessment purposes under Fl. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(a) and Fl. Stat. &sect; 193.461(3)(b) (1993). The court approved the decision of the lower court and held that when determining the actual, good faith use of the land for tax purposes, the zoned use was but one factor that an assessor or reviewing court could consider along with the other specified factors provided in Fl. Stat. &sect; 193.461(3)(b)1-7 (1993). The court held that the determination of the actual, good faith use of the land for tax purposes also required an evaluation of the various factors surrounding the alleged agricultural use as provided in Fl. Stat. &sect; 193.461(3)(b), which included the duration and continuity of the use, the purchase price and size of the land, whether the land was cared for in a manner to support the alleged use, whether there was a lease and, if so, its terms, and &quot;such other factors&quot; as might have been apparent. The court disapproved the inconsistent case.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the judgment of the lower court denying appellant's motion for postconviction relief, the court held that appellant had not been denied effective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his trial and that appellant had failed to establish that the state had withheld exculpatory material. Because the trial record established that appellant's counsel had motioned the court to appoint a clinical psychologist to help in developing evidence of statutory and non-statutory mitigation and because counsel made reasonable efforts to investigate and present the available mitigating evidence, the court found appellant failed to establish that his counsel was ineffective and, therefore, failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice. Where appellant's death sentence was based upon numerous objective aggravating factors, the court found that the record supported the trial court's factual findings and imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the trial court's decision, the court agreed with the trial court that no evidentiary hearing was necessary because the trial court conducted a lengthy hearing where both sides were allowed to present arguments as to the issues raised in appellant's motion to vacate. Appellant also asserted problems with the assistance he received from his trial counsel.

However, the court did agree with appellant's contention that the sentence imposed was disproportionate to the crime and violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII as cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that a death sentence for appellant, who did not directly participate in the actual killing, was disproportionate relative to the life sentences that several co-defendants, who also did not directly participate in the killing, received. It was unconstitutional to permit the imposition of the death penalty on a defendant who aided and abetted a felony in the course of which a murder was committed by others, but who did not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force be employed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's death sentence was reversed as disproportionate because the evidence demonstrated that appellant did not participate in the actual killing.</SPAN></P>

Respondent contended that the closed meetings violated the Sunshine Law, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 286.011. Petitioner argued that the closed meetings were covered under the exemption to the Sunshine Law, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 395.3035(4). The circuit court held that the statutory exemption was unconstitutional and hence the agreement was void ab initio. The court of appeals affirmed and certified the question of whether the statutory exemption was constitutional under the provisions of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 24(b) and (c). The court held that the exemption was facially unconstitutional because it did not meet the exacting constitutional standard of specificity as to stated public necessity and limited breadth to accomplish that purpose. The court reasoned that the exemption allowed a board to close the portions of their meetings at which written strategic plans were discussed, but the statute contained neither a definition of &quot;strategic plans&quot; nor a justification for the breadth of the exemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent newspaper sought a declaratory decree that petitioner hospital's records were subject to the Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 119, and that meetings of petitioner's board of directors were subject to the Sunshine Law, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 286.011(1). The lower court found for respondent. On appeal, the court approved the lower court decision. Petitioner was a private nonprofit corporation to which operation of public hospital facilities had been transferred. Petitioner was acting on behalf of a state agency in performing and carrying out obligations under their agreement, and the totality of factors showed that the agency's authorized function had been delegated to petitioner. An exemption from public records access was available under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 24, only if the legislature provided by general law for the exemption of records. It was clear that petitioner was acting on behalf of a public agency. The court did not decide the constitutionality of the recently passed Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 395.3036, which would have made the records confidential, because respondent did not follow the usual procedure for constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the lower court's decision requiring petitioner to provide access to its records and meetings because a governmental agency had delegated its authorized role to petitioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county government adopted several ordinances levying special assessments on property located in the county to pay for garbage services, landfill closure, ambulance service, and fire protection. Several years later, the assessments were declared invalid, and petitioner and other residents sought refunds. The trial court found that petitioner was not entitled to a refund. The district court affirmed. The court approved the district court decision. The United States Supreme Court remanded the matter to the court for reconsideration based on its recent decision in a similar case, and the court reaffirmed its decision. The court opined that the U.S. Supreme Court case was inapplicable to the present action because it was a taxpayer remedy case involving a different statute. The court noted that the remedy petitioner chose was never an issue, but instead the parties focused exclusively on the merits of his refund claim. Because the county acted in good faith in levying the assessments, and because the invalid tax scheme applied across the board and conferred a commensurate benefit, equitable considerations precluded a refund to petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, appellants, county property appraisers, retroactively increased significantly the assessed value of properties that served as family homesteads after determining that they had mistakenly undervalued improvements to the properties. Appellees, the property owners, filed complaints protesting the increases. Appellants asserted that Fla. Stat. &sect; 193.155(8)(a) (1995) bestowed upon them the authority to reach back and correct an erroneous calculation of the base year &quot;just value&quot; assessment and then apply that corrected value to subsequent years. In both cases, a court eventually struck down the increase in value after it determined that Fla. Stat. &sect; 193.155 (1995) violated Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, which set forth guidelines for the taxing of homesteads. The court consolidated the appeals. The court affirmed the denials of the retroactive application of the increased valuations, holding that appellants lacked authority under Fla.

Respondent violated his probation and it was revoked and he was then resentenced. At that time, respondent was given credit for his previously awarded incentive and basic gain time. However, respondent was not given credit for his previously awarded overcrowding gain time. The court noted that an ex post facto inquiry involved not only looking at the time of offense, but also involved looking at subsequent time frames as well to determine whether a possible, yet speculative benefit had become more definite. The court found that the state could not apply the Safe Streets Initiative, Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A referee submitted a recommendation that respondent, a previously suspended attorney, be disbarred for soliciting a bribe in exchange for giving deposition testimony and for avoiding legal service of process. Respondent sought a bribe in exchange for testifying favorably to the landlord in a real estate dispute. The state's highest court held that it had continuing jurisdiction over suspended attorneys such as respondent pursuant to R. Reg. Fla. Bar 3-5.1(e) and pursuant to the court's inherent authority to discipline attorneys who were suspended, disbarred, or had resigned in lieu of facing disciplinary charges by holding such attorneys in contempt of the terms of the court orders under which they were disciplined. The court rejected respondent's argument that R. Reg. Fla. Bar. 4-8.4(c) was unconstitutionally vague, even though the rule left the term &quot;dishonesty&quot; undefined. The referee did not clearly err in finding, as an aggravating factor, that respondent acted with a dishonest or selfish motive. Because respondent's actions undermined the integrity of the judicial process, disbarment was not too harsh a sanction. The court adopted the referee's recommendation.</SPAN></P>

After appellant and the tobacco companies settled, respondents sought payment for services. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court had no authority to order disbursement of funds to respondents based upon their charging liens because the terms of the parties' contract for legal services controlled. Payment of legal fees was contractually based upon a contingency fee percentage of the settlement amount paid to appellant by appellees. The court required respondents to seek payment in a separate and distinct action. In response to the parties' post-appeal filing of a suggestion of mootness, the court dismissed appellant's writ of prohibition but declined to enter a consent degree, remanding the matter to the circuit court for further consideration. The court granted relief to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of appellant State of Florida, holding that respondent attorneys' charging liens against a settlement fund paid by tobacco companies to appellant to cover the costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses were invalid and that the circuit court lacked authority to order appellant to pay respondents' legal fees out of that fund because payment was governed by the parties' contract for legal services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents challenged the judgment of the Third District Court of Appeals (Florida) that upheld the constitutionality of the Grandparental Visitation Rights statute,&nbsp;Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the biological maternal grandparents, filed a petition for unsupervised visitation with petitioner parents' child, as authorized by the Grandparental Visitation Rights statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(a), alleging that the biological father and adoptive mother had refused reasonable visitation with the child and that such visitation was in the child's best interests. Petitioners countered that they had a fundamental privacy right to determine with whom the child associated and that subsection (1)(a) violated that right. The court noted that while an implicit right of privacy was recognized under the federal constitution, Floridians enjoyed an explicit right of privacy under Fla. Const. art.1, &sect; 23, which granted the citizens of Florida more protection from governmental intrusion than that afforded under the federal constitution. The court found that petitioners possessed a constitutional right of privacy in their decision to limit the grandparents' visitation with their child. The court declared that &sect; 752.01(1)(a) was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that a subsection of the Grandparental Visitation Rights statute was facially unconstitutional because government's interference in a parent's decision to exclude or limit grandparental visitation could not be countenanced without a showing of a compelling state interest and no compelling state interest existed. Therefore, the order granting respondent grandparents visitation rights was quashed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant death row inmate was sentenced to death for kidnapping and murder. On death row he murdered a prison guard and was again sentenced to death. A federal appeals court mandated a resentencing proceeding. The resentencing was challenged on the basis of 17 claims of error. The court affirmed, disposing of several claims as procedurally barred. The court also ruled that a detective witness's presence in the courtroom was permitted as sequestration was not required for expert or unique fact witnesses. The jury instructions on consecutive life sentences were adequate because the judge explained that the sentence's total could ensure appellant a life sentence. Appellant was properly excluded from the court room due to his obstructionist behavior. Additionally, prosecutorial misconduct allegations did not warrant voiding the entire proceeding. Finally, the court reviewed the aggravators and mitigators and upheld them, with the exception of the &quot;heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravator as no evidence was given of the victim's last hours spent with appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant death row inmate's death sentences were upheld because his claims of error were either procedurally barred or not supported by the record or rule of law regarding sequestration of witnesses, jury instructions on consecutive life sentences, exclusion from the courtroom for obstructionist behavior, and prosecutorial misconduct. However, the finding that a &quot;heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; sentence aggravator existed was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Where the jury was informed that consecutive life sentences could be imposed, it was sufficient apprised of the consequences of a life recommendation. The court found no error in the jury instructions, and the judge acted within his discretion in removing appellant for disruption. Further, there was no abuse of discretion in the removal of three jurors. The trial court erred in finding the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator, but the error was harmless. In affirming, the court held that appellant's death sentences were proportional to other death sentence cases.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 403.161(1)(b) (1993) for failing to comply with special conditions to prevent pollution expressly set out in a dredge and fill permit issued by respondent environmental agency.

The district court of appeal reversed the decision and expressly held the statute was constitutional. On appeal to the state supreme court, the decision of the appellate court was affirmed. The court held that the statute appeared to strike a practical and proper balance between the legislature's function in establishing fundamental policy and an administrative agency's administration and fulfillment of that policy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of armed robbery and first degree murder. The trial judge followed the jury's recommendation of a death sentence, finding no factors in mitigation and three factors in aggravation. Appellant sought review, raising numerous claims. Among other things, appellant claimed that he was deprived of an adversarial testing in the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. For several reasons, the court found that the trial judge properly denied an evidentiary hearing on appellant's claim as to the guilt phase. As to the penalty phase, however, the court found that appellant had stated sufficient allegations of mitigation that were not conclusively refuted by the record to warrant an evidentiary hearing to determine whether counsel failed to properly investigate and present mitigation evidence. The same rationale applied to appellant's claim that he was denied an effective mental health expert. Thus, the order was both affirmed and reversed in part and the trial court was directed to conduct an evidentiary hearing on appellant's contentions that his trial counsel was ineffective and that appellant was deprived of an effective mental health expert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee criminal defendant was charged with perjury. Prior to her trial, she moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the state perjury statute was unconstitutional because it did not allow the jury to decide the element of materiality. Dismissal was affirmed by an intermediate appellate court, but on further appeal the state supreme court reversed. The court held that the lower courts erroneously relied upon federal precedent dealing with a federal perjury statute that unequivocally made materiality a factual element. While it was true that juries must decide all factual elements, a state legislature was not required to make materiality in a perjury case a factual element. In the case of Florida's perjury statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 837.02 (1993), materiality was not a factual element but was instead a question of law for the court to decide preliminarily.

The jury recommended a sentence of death. The trial court sentenced appellant to death. The trial court found four aggravating factors and two non-statutory mitigating factors. Appellant sought review of the judgment. Appellant argued that the evidence does not support the trial court's finding that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC). The court reasoned that although the stabbing lasted only for a period of minutes, expert testimony at trial indicated that the victim was alive and conscious during the attack and obviously had moved either in an effort to stand or to evade his attacker. Similar to other case law, the court found that this evidence sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the murder was HAC. Appellant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court's finding that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP). The court affirmed the sentence. The court found that appellant's plan to find a car and kill the person who owned it demonstrated calculation and planning necessary to find the CCP aggravator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Attorney General sought review of a proposed citizen initiative amendment to the Florida Constitution. The ballot concerned a term limits pledge, under which the Secretary of State would permit, but not require, candidates for the United States Congress to pledge to serve a maximum of three terms if elected to the House of Representatives and two terms if elected to the Senate. It would also require that all primary, special, and general election ballots indicate which candidates took the pledge and which broke it. The court concluded that the proposed amendment could not be placed on the ballot. There was no violation of the single subject requirement in the ballot. However, it affected Fla. Const. art. IV and VI, neither of which granted constitutional recognition to the Secretary of State's election-related powers and duties. Florida statutes, not the Florida Constitution, established the Secretary of State as the chief election officer of the state. Fla. Stat. ch. 97.012 (1997). The ballot failed to inform the public that the Secretary of State would be granted discretionary constitutional powers not presently possessed.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court concluded that the lemon law was constitutional. It also held that under lemon law procedures, the burden of proof was on the party appealing the arbitration board's determination, in this case petitioner.

Appellant challenged the murder and robbery convictions and his death sentence, raising 17 issues on appeal. The court rejected them all and affirmed. Appellant forced the victim into his vehicle with his two assailants, drove to a remote location, ignored the victim's repeated pleas to live, had an accomplice shoot the victim once, and then he shot the victim twice. First, appellant's statements to police were not involuntary and should not have been suppressed. The court found no error in the trial court's ruling that the statements were freely and voluntarily given to police after appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights. Second, a videotape of appellant's walk-over from the police station to the jail should not have been excluded from evidence, as the trial court properly performed the balancing test under Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners clinic and doctor filed a writ of quo warranto, alleging that respondents, the state legislature and its officers, exceeded their authority in overriding petitioner governor's veto of Committee Substitute for House Bill 1227. Petitioner governor sought a writ of mandamus challenging the override of the same bill and Committee Substitute for House Bill 1597. The court denied both petitions, noting that because the issues created uncertainty, immediate determination was required. It considered whether respondents violated the Florida Constitution by failing to take up the vetoed bills at the special session and then voting to override them at the next regular session. It held that there was no express requirement that respondents take up the veto messages when they were presented. Without that requirement, the court could not conclude that respondents acted without authority in postponing consideration of the vetoed bills until the next regular session. Thus, the court denied the petitions and held that respondents did not violate the constitution by overriding petitioner governor's vetoes of these bills at the next regular session rather than at the special session.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his nolo contendere pleas on counts of burglary and petit theft and was convicted at trial on a count of robbery. The court considered whether a ruling on impeachment was preserved for review where respondent did not testify. The court determined that a lower court's ruling on an impeachment issue did not amount to a constitutional violation unless the subject of the ruling itself had constitutional implications. Because the court did not find an unconstitutional infringement on respondent's right to testify, the lower court's ruling did not rise to an unconstitutional infringement. Thus, the lower court's preliminary ruling did not impermissibly violate respondent's right to testify. The court quashed the lower court's decision, holding that where respondent did not testify, there was no way to assess whether his failure to testify was harmful to his case. Further, he failed to preserve his claim of improper impeachment by not testifying.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment and sentence of the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), which convicted appellant of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, and other violent felonies, and overrode a jury recommendation of life imprisonment and imposed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, argued trial court error during the jury selection process. The court disagreed, ruling that alleged prosecutorial misconduct during voir dire was not preserved for review, that no abuse of discretion occurred when requested individual voir dire was refused, and that peremptory challenges could be used by both parties against persons -- not challengeable for cause -- inclined against their interests. While the admission of codefendants' confessions against appellant was error, it was harmless in view of appellant's own confession, freely given following Miranda warnings. Nor was reversal required when the conviction might have rested on an inadequate legal theory without evidentiary support, when an alternative theory existed for which evidence was sufficient. And testimony regarding the officer's last words was admissible to show that he was acting as a law enforcement officer, not a security guard. But the override of a jury recommendation of life imprisonment was reversible error, given such mitigating factors of appellant's borderline intelligence, his brain lesion, and that he was not the triggerman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed convicting appellant of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, and other violent felonies, as alleged errors during jury selection and the trial's guilt phase were either not preserved for review, harmless, or without merit, but trial court's override of jury recommendation of life imprisonment and imposition of death sentence reversed, as mitigating factors -- appellant was not armed -- supported recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed the denial of respondent inmate's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion for credit for time served and held that Rule 3.800 was a proper vehicle for raising a credit time issue where credit could be determined from court records. That court then certified the question for review because its decision was in direct conflict with other district court of appeal decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent inmate entered pleas of no contest and was sentenced in two cases. He then made a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion requesting jail credit and alleged that court records reflected that he was entitled to credit for time spent in county jail but that he had not received credit at sentencing. On appeal from a denial of the motion, the lower court reversed, holding that Rule 3.800 was a proper vehicle for raising credit time issues. The lower court certified the opinion in which it so held as being in direct conflict with other district court opinions. The court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that credit time issues were cognizable in a Rule 3.800 motion when it was affirmatively alleged that the court records demonstrated on their face an entitlement to relief. The court noted that failure to grant proper jail credit for time served created an illegal sentence under Rule 3.800 because Fla. Stat. ch. 921.161(1) (1995) affirmatively mandated that no sentence could be imposed without crediting a defendant with jail time already served. The court determined that such an illegal sentence could be corrected at any time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness observed appellant and another man with the victim beside a car in a motel parking area. The witness heard gunshots and saw the victim's body on the ground. The witness observed the other man get out of the vehicle before it sped away. The police found victim's car abandoned a few blocks from the murder scene. Appellant's fingerprints were on the car. Appellant was later found with the murder weapon. He was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder and robbery with a firearm. Appellant was sentenced to death. He sought review. The court affirmed the conviction because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred guilt to the exclusion of all other inferences. Even though there was sufficient evidence that appellant robbed and murdered the victim, the death sentence was a disproportionate punishment for the crime because there was not proof of appellant's mental state beyond a reasonable doubt that he actually killed victim. Mere participation in a robbery that resulted in murder was not enough culpability to warrant the death penalty, thus the case was remanded and with instructions to sentence appellant to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the trial court that convicted appellant of first-degree premeditated murder and robbery with a firearm was affirmed because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred guilt.

P. 3.850. Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and first degree murder. Appellant argued the trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate without holding any type of hearing. Appellant alleged that under the Huff decision, a hearing was required to allow the attorneys the opportunity to argue the merits of holding an evidentiary hearing. The prosecution conceded that a Huff hearing was required; however, it asserted that the error was harmless. The court reversed the judgment and concluded that pursuant to Huff, trial judges must allow attorneys in a capital case the opportunity to be heard on an initial Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion. Such a hearing was necessary due to the severity of the punishment at issue in death cases. The purpose of a Huff hearing was to allow the trial judge to determine whether an evidentiary hearing was required and to hear legal argument relating to the motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent cable company challenged the county's ad valorem tax assessment of its tangible personal property by petitioner appraiser for four years. Petitioner's assessments were based on the income/unit rule method of valuation. The district court reversed the trial court's ratification of the tax assessments and certified the question of whether the income/unit rule method of appraisal was an appropriate method of assessing the tangible personal property of television cable companies. The court noted that the Fla. Const. prohibited local government entities from levying ad valorem taxes on intangible personal property. It then found that that insofar as both the income and unit rule methods taxed intangible property, they were an unconstitutional method for use with cable companies. The court further found that the reassessment for the 1989 tax year was done without authority because the 1989 tax rolls had been certified and the taxes were paid before reassessment could occur. Thus, the decision of the district court was approved.</SPAN></P>

Respondents initiated a lawsuit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief regarding whether the functioning of Florida's electric chair rendered it an unconstitutional method of execution. The court granted the petition and found that respondents were not statutorily authorized to initiate the federal civil rights action. The court found that respondents' representation was limited by statute to actions challenging the validity of a defendant's conviction and sentence such as habeas corpus, coram nobis, and actions established by the court in Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, 3.851, and 3.852. Respondents' representation was limited to traditional postconviction relief actions that challenged only the validity of the conviction and sentence, and the representation did not include the authority to bring civil actions challenging the means and the methods of carrying out a validly imposed sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murders, among other crimes, in various states. For multiple first degree murders committed in Kansas, appellant received consecutive life sentences. After extradition, appellant later was convicted in Florida of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. After various denials of relief in state and federal court, appellant filed a second motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 (Rule 3.850) to vacate his judgment and death sentence; the trial court denied appellant's claims, finding them procedurally barred for several reasons. On review, the court found that appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on an alleged lack of funding for a defense counsel agency to investigate new leads was without merit, because appellant had had made no showing as to why the discovery of that newly discovered evidence was not available through due diligence either at the time of trial or within the time limits set forth in Rule 3.850. Even if appellant was able to overcome the due diligence element, he failed to establish that the new leads would have resulted in an acquittal on retrial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court of Appeals (Florida) affirmed the probate court's judgment, which granted additional attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 733.6171(7) (1993) to appellee attorney (the appointed administrator ad litem) and appellee attorneys of petitioner co-personal representative. Petitioner appealed, raising a conflict over the issue of the point in time when appellee attorneys' substantive right to collect attorney fees vested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator died in 1991. Pursuant to the will, petitioner and another brother were appointed co-personal representatives. Because bitter conflict marked the administration of the estate by 1992, each personal representative retained separate attorneys and all parties agreed to the probate court's appointment of appellee attorney to serve as administrator ad litem. After a settlement was reached, the lower courts ruled that petitioner's attorneys and appellee administrator ad litem were entitled to attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 733.6171(7) (1993). Finding that appellee attorneys' substantive rights derived from the former statute, ch. 733.617(1) (1991), that was in effect when their representation began, the court held that the attorneys had no right to recover under ch. 733.6171(7), which did not take effect until 1993. Although ch. 733.6171(7) could have no retrospective effect, the court nevertheless sustained the award of attorney fees to appellee attorneys because petitioner's egregious conduct provided grounds for applying the inequitable conduct doctrine -- a limited exception to the general American Rule that each party must bear its own attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court disapproved of the lower court's reasons for awarding additional attorney fees to appellee attorney (the appointed administrator ad litem) and appellee attorneys of petitioner co-personal representative, holding that the new statute did not take effect until after appellee attorneys began their representation. The court approvedthe result, however, because petitioner's egregious conduct made the inequitable conduct doctrine applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the murder of her husband by arsenic poisoning, and was sentenced to death. At the trial, evidence was introduced regarding the death of a second man with whom appellant lived and the poisoning of a third man. An FBI agent's lab report about the capsules given to the third poisoning victim was admitted at the trial, but the FBI agent was later investigated for his performance. Appellant filed numerous public document requests and suits requesting information about this investigation, and based her third motion for postconviction relief on the documents she received, arguing, inter alia, that they were exculpatory Brady materials. The trial court summarily denied the motion, and she appealed. The court agreed that there was no reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different had the evidence regarding the agent's problems at the FBI laboratory been disclosed to the defense. The verdict and sentence were affirmed because there was no reasonable probability that the new evidence would result in an acquittal or recommendation of life on retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for postconviction relief because even if the information was considered newly discovered, because it could not have been known by appellant or her counsel at the time of trial by the use of due diligence it was not of such a nature that it would probably produce a different result on retrial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of an order of the Circuit Court in and for Leon County (Florida), which declared several Florida statutes facially unconstitutional, the District Court of Appeal, First District, certified that the order involved issue of great public importance and thereby required the court's resolution. The statutes at issue, Fla. Stat. ch. 106.071, 106.143, and 106.144 (1995), all concerned campaign advertising and financing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed for a declaratory judgment that Fla. Stat. ch. 106.071, 106.143, and 106.144 (1995), all governing campaign advertising and financing, were unconstitutional on grounds that the statutes were overbroad and infringed on their right to engage in anonymous political advocacy under U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court denied the complaint and the appellate court certified the issue to the court. Appellants argued on appeal that the reporting and identification requirements of the statutes were overbroad and violated two United States Supreme Court decisions. The court held that the statutes were not substantially overbroad, and thus were not facially unconstitutional. The court saw no reason to discard the statutes in toto because the rights of some Florida citizens might be chilled in some way. Moreover, Florida courts were capable of addressing any infirmity in the statutes that could be alleged in the future on an &quot;as applied&quot; basis. As such, the court found that its construction of the statutes was not incongruous with the United States Supreme Court decisions, and it affirmed the trial court's order upholding the statutes' constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state death row inmate filed suit against appellee state attorney general, seeking compelled disclosure of appellee's records with respect to appellant.

On direct appeal to the state supreme court, the trial court's ruling was affirmed. The state supreme court held that the documents in question were simply preliminary guides intended to aid the attorneys when they later formalized the knowledge, and not final evidence of knowledge obtained in connection with the transaction of official business.

V, &sect; 3(b)(3), (4), the District Court of Appeal, Lee County (Florida), certified a question of great public importance concerning the payment of attorney fees to petitioner landowners under the eminent domain statute contained at Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73.092 (Supp. 1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county filed eminent domain proceedings in three separate cases, and there was a dispute over the amount of attorney's fees to be paid by respondent county under Fla.

Petitioner landowners alleged that benefits should be determined by subtracting respondent's good-faith estimate of value from the amount that was finally paid for the land. Respondent asserted that benefits achieved for the client were based upon the difference between the amount of respondent's written offer and the ultimate award. The trial court accepted petitioner landowners' arguments and awarded the larger amount of attorney's fees. The appellate court reversed, finding that the good-faith estimate of value did not constitute a written offer as contemplated by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73.092(1)(a) (Supp. 1994). The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court and held that a good-faith estimate of value did not constitute a written offer as set forth in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73.092 (Supp. 1994). Therefore, the court found that attorney fees were calculated based upon a percentage of the difference between the amount of respondent's written offer and the ultimate award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, finding that the language of the eminent domain statute did not permit the court to conclude that a good faith estimate of value was the equivalent of a written offer for purposes of awarding attorney fees to petitioner landowners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a routine inspection of petitioner's prison cell, officers discovered fifteen gallons of a heady brew and charged petitioner with manufacturing an unauthorized beverage.

Upon review, however, the court noted that the interplay between Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.630, which set forth general filing requirements, including time restrictions, and Fla. Stat.

The court quashed affirmation of petitioner's conviction and remanded because it held that a citizen's property was protected by the federal and Florida constitutions against warrantless seizure even when the seizure was done pursuant to a statutory scheme for forfeiture.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court certified a question involving the application of Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04, which detailed the potential penalty for a minor under the age of 16, and whether the statute furthered a compelling state interest through the least intrusive means. The underlying facts involved the violation of ch. 800.04 by two 15-year old boys who allegedly had &quot;consensual&quot; sexual intercourse with two 12-year old girls. The trial judge found ch. 800.04 unconstitutional as applied to the two boys because it violated their rights to privacy and equal protection. The district court reversed the lower court's decision. The state supreme court found that whatever right of privacy a minor might have in having sexual intercourse with another minor was outweighed by the state's interest in protecting the welfare of other minor children. Minors did not have absolute privacy rights. The court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04 was constitutional as applied, because it furthered a compelling state interest through the least intrusive means, and the court therefore approved the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County (Florida), which imposed a death sentence on resentencing, for his convictions of first degree murder, armed burglary, and theft of an automobile. The state cross-appealed, raising three issues concerning the resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder, armed robbery, and theft of an automobile, and was sentenced to death. In postconviction proceedings, the circuit court found that appellant's penalty-phase counsel had provided ineffective representation in that he failed to adequately investigate and present extensive mitigation evidence. The court affirmed, a new penalty phase was conducted, and the trial court again imposed a death sentence. On appeal, the court held it could not rule on appellant's issue as to whether the sentence of death was proportionate in light of the resentencing evidence because the trial court's order on the resentencing was so lacking in detail. The trial court's summary analysis of mitigating circumstances, however, plainly did not evaluate in writing the evidence presented or explain the reason for the trial court's weighing of the mitigation evidence. Appellant's sentence was vacated and remanded for the trial court to prepare a detailed analysis in its sentencing order of its evaluation of the mitigation evidence presented. There was no merit in the state's cross-appeal pertaining to the trial court's refusal to apply certain aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of appellant's death sentence, the court found that the trial court's sentencing order did not provide a written evaluation of mitigation evidence presented in the resentencing penalty phase; as such, the sentence was vacated and remanded for the trial court to prepare a more detailed analysis in its sentencing order. The state's cross-appeal as to the trial court's refusal to apply aggravating factors was denied for lack of merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Volusia County (Florida), which, after his confession, convicted defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main evidence against defendant was a police officer's testimony that defendant confessed to the murder. There was no dispute defendant was involved in plea negotiations and that the police officer was acting as a negotiator between defendant and the state attorney prosecuting the case. At the time defendant confessed there was an agreement already signed by the state attorney providing defendant would be spared the death penalty if he confessed. The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction because the confession was obtained during plea negotiations in violation of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.172(h). It was clear defendant exhibited an actual subjective expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion because the state had already presented a signed written agreement to defendant. Defendant's expectation was reasonable because it was obvious the state desired to negotiate a deal. It was clear that the officer was negotiating for the state and defendant for himself. The negotiations did not cease when defendant confessed because defendant was told numerous times that the state would negotiate if he gave a statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the lower court's murder conviction, finding defendant's confession had to be suppressed because it was obtained during plea negotiations. Defendant's expectation that he was arranging a plea agreement was reasonable because the state brought to the negotiation a signed written agreement for defendant to sign.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 960.293(2)(b), which was part of the Civil Restitution Lien and Crime Victims' Remedy Act (the Act). The county court found the Act unconstitutional because it imposed excessive fines and violated due process and equal protection clauses of the Florida and United States Constitutions. The Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the lower court and found the Act constitutional. Petitioner sought review of the judgment. Petitioner contended that the flat per diem charge violated his substantive due process rights. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court. Applying the test for determining substantive due process, the court found that the Act was not unconstitutional because the per diem charge on convicted offenders clearly related to a permissive legislative objection of reimbursing the public for the cost expended in incarcerating the offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and other violent charges. Appellant and his cohorts forced their way into the home of the victims, burglarized the home, raped the wife, and killed the husband by shooting him in the back of the head. Appellant challenged the conviction and death-sentence arguing, inter alia, that the killing was not premeditated and that impermissible evidence was introduced in the penalty phase of the proceedings. The court agreed with appellant that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of premeditation to the exclusion of all other theories because the gun belonged to the victim and appellant was unfamiliar with the weapon. Nevertheless, the court upheld the first-degree murder conviction. The court also agreed with appellant that the testimony regarding appellant's threat to kill the wife because she could identify him was impermissibly introduced because it was clearly outside the scope of direct examination and not relevant to the penalty phase of the proceedings. The court therefore affirmed the conviction but vacated the death sentence and remanded for a new penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's death sentence for first-degree murder and other charges was vacated and remanded for a new penalty phase because the finding of premeditation was in error because the prosecution could not exclude all other theories within a reasonable doubt, and because impermissible irrelevant testimony, outside the scope of direct examination, was introduced during the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the ruling. The court affirmed the trial court judgment after finding no reversible error. The court held that defendant's confrontation clause rights were not violated by the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to sever or by the introduction of a co-defendant's confession implicating appellant. The court held that although admission of that portion of the co-defendant's confession implicating appellant should not have been introduced into evidence, the error was harmless. The court found that appellant's own confession was powerful evidence of his guilt and that the co-defendant's confession merely mirrored appellant's confession.

Addressing the rule 3.850 motion, the court held that trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase. Counsel called three mitigating witnesses in addition to appellant's mother, all of whom had close contact with defendant. The court also found no merit to defendant's ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim made in his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Appellate counsel's failure to object to the sentencing order as being insufficiently specific was proper because the order comported with the law in effect at that time. Finding his remaining claims in both pleadings to be meritless or procedurally barred, the court affirmed the denial of his rule 3.850 motion and denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was sentenced to death for first-degree murder, sought postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Defendant argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to move for the disqualification of the judge at his resentencing. The court concluded that the allegations in defendant's motion regarding the judge's conduct and counsel's failure to move for disqualification were sufficient as a matter of law to warrant an evidentiary hearing. Thus, the court remanded with directions that the trial court conduct an evidentiary hearing on this issue. However, the court held that defendant's other claims of ineffective assistance were properly denied as legally insufficient. Further, the court held that the record refuted defendant's contention that the state attorney's office was required to comply with Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 119.07(2)(a), which required an agency to list the basis for a claimed public records exception. The submitted papers were not public records under Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual battery, and one count of kidnapping and was sentenced to death. His convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Appellant was denied clemency, but his execution was stayed to allow for post-conviction litigation. Appellant challenged a trial court judgment denying his motion for relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 and argued that the trial court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing or the right to take depositions on his public records claim, which was based solely on the affidavits of records custodians submitted by the state. The appeals court affirmed. The court agreed that appellant should have been allowed to explore the existence of a missing, unedited videotape of the murder scene but held that the trial court's failure to allow appellant to cross-examine or depose the affiants was harmless. Moreover, the court ruled that because appellant confessed to the murder several times and his codefendant testified against him at trial, even if the tape was available, there was no possibility that it would contain any information that could form the basis for a claim under rule 3.850.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county and its municipalities entered into an interlocal agreement specifying that the surtax proceeds of Fla.

Plaintiff county filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration of the legality of the surtax and the interlocal agreement. The trial court held that 1994 Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sisters sought review of a trial court's grant of appellee manufacturers' motion for summary judgment on appellants' negligence claims, on the basis that they were time barred by a four year statute of limitations; the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal (Florida) certified a question for review. Plaintiff brother and appellant sisters had sued appellees for injuries allegedly sustained when their mother ingested appellees' drug.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sisters and plaintiff brother alleged they were injured as a result of their exposure to appellee manufacturers' drug when their mother ingested it while she was pregnant. Appellants were informed of their possible injuries, but did not bring their action within four years. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that appellants' action was barred by the statute of limitations. Appellants contended their cause of action did not accrue until a case was decided that allowed them to assert the market-share alternative theory of liability because they were unable to identify the manufacturers of the drug ingested by their mother. The lower court certified for review the question of when the cause of action accrued. The state supreme court held that there was nothing in the case law construing the statute of limitations for negligence actions that supported the conclusion that the running of the statute commenced when a new theory of liability was adopted or even when a new cause of action was created. Rather, the statute of limitations for appellants' cause of action began to run when appellants knew or should have known of their injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary with an assault and battery in an occupied dwelling and first degree murder. A death sentence was imposed. Upon review, the court held that denial of appellant's request to discharge an appointed co-counsel was not improper because appellant had no right to co-counsel. Furthermore, it was not error for appellant to be absent from two sidebar conferences during the jury selection process because appellant was present in the courtroom. In addition, there was sufficient evidence to support the first degree murder and burglary convictions based on premeditation or felony murder. The court held that a trier of fact could have reasonably found proof of the victim's withdrawal of consent to enter victim's apartment beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no reasonable hypothesis of evidence. Finally, the trial court applied the right rule of law regarding aggravators, competent substantial evidence supported the findings of the aggravators, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by assigning minimal weight to mitigating factors, and the death sentence was held to be proportionate. Therefore, the convictions and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged three death sentences imposed after he was convicted of luring a female tourist and her two daughters into a boat, raping and murdering them, and dumping their bodies at sea. On appeal, the court held that evidence showing that defendant raped another female tourist at sea one month earlier was properly admitted as a prior bad act under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 90.404(2)(a) to prove identity because pervasive similarities existed in the modus operandi of the crimes. The other act evidence was also relevant to show defendant's plan, scheme, intent, and motive to commit violence on women tourists. The admission of this other act evidence did not, in effect, force defendant to repeatedly invoke his U. S. Const. amend. V right to remain silent on the witness stand. Admission of defendant's daughter's prior consistent statement, that defendant told her he was wanted for committing the murders, was relevant to impeach defendant's assertion that he told his daughter he was innocent. During the penalty phase, defendant validly waived presentation of mitigating evidence showing that he suffered an abusive childhood. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's three murder convictions and three death sentences, holding that other act evidence was properly admitted to prove identity, scheme, plan, and motive and that admission of a prior consistent statement by defendant's daughter was relevant to impeach defendant's testimony that he had told his daughter that he was innocent of the murders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant sought review of his convictions in the Circuit Court in and for Brevard County (Florida), for first degree murder, burglary of a dwelling, sexual battery with physical force, kidnapping, and robbery. Defendant also challenged the death sentence imposed for the first degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's judgment convicting him of multiple felonies, including first degree murder, sexual battery with physical force, kidnapping, burglary, and robbery as well as the death sentence imposed. Defendant, who had an IQ of 71, brutally raped and battered his 81-year-old neighbor, dumped her body into the trunk of her car, and drove to Georgia where he buried her. On appeal, the court held that the jurors represented a fair cross-section of the community even though, pursuant to a standing court order, the county clerk excused members of the venire in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40.013(5) (1995). Because defendant did not timely challenge the clerk's practice, this issue was not preserved for appeal. The aggravating factor of premeditation did not exist. However, the trial court erred in refusing to grant defendant's motion seeking transport to a hospital to have a brain scan performed so that a defense specialist could evaluate the degree of defendant's mental impairment, a statutory mitigating factor under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141 (1995). The court remanded, ordering a brain scan and, possibly, a new penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for, inter alia, first degree murder but remanded so that defendant could be transported to a hospital for a brain scan to explore whether imposition of the death sentence might be mitigated by virtue of poor impulse control caused by brain damage. If medical evidence so adduced supported the mitigating factor, the court ordered a new penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Kormondy's convictions affirmed for one count of first-degree felony murder, three counts of armed sexual battery, one count of burglary of a dwelling with an assault and an intent to commit a theft, and one count of armed robbery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Escambia County (Florida), where he was convicted of first degree felony murder, armed sexual battery, burglary of a dwelling with an assault and intent to commit a theft, and armed robbery. Defendant claimed the trial court erred at the penalty phase of his trial by permitting testimony indicating intent by defendant to commit future killings if he got out of jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one court of first degree felony murder, three counts of armed sexual battery, one count of burglary of a dwelling with an assault and intent to commit a theft, and one count of armed robbery. The trial judge imposed the sentence of death for the murder. The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions but vacated his sentence of death, holding that the trial court erred in the penalty phase of the trial in admitting bad character evidence in the form of nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. The trial court's reversible error was allowing a witness to testify, on cross-examination by the state, to a statement defendant allegedly made to a cellmate in jail, after the murder, that defendant would kill the wife of the murder victim if he ever got out of jail. The testimony was prejudicial because it indicated that defendant would kill again. The testimony was inflammatory and could have unduly influenced the penalty-phase jury. The manner in which the cross-examination was conducted constituted an impermissible, nonstatutory aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Madison County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder and other crimes and the sentenced him to death. Appellant's major assignments of error related to the trial court's handling of testimony and cross-examination, and refusal to give certain jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's allowance of testimony, found no error in the failure to give certain instructions, and affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence. The court held that it was proper for the medical examiner to offer his opinion that the victim was still alive after appellant had bound and gagged him, and thus perhaps received a fatal wound in that condition. The court held that appellant had opened the door to cross-examination about whether he bit the victim, and held that inquiry into appellant's understanding of the victim's condition when appellant left him was proper. The court held that appellant's statement, made the day before he escaped from prison, that he was going to kill the victim, was admissible under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(3)(a)(2) (1995) to prove appellant's conduct. The court ruled that it was not necessary to give a circumstantial evidence instruction, and that the standard instructions on reasonable doubt and heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstances were constitutional. The court held that there was no improper doubling of aggravating factors, since both robbery and kidnapping had been proved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder. The court found no error in the trial court's allowance of expert opinion testimony or cross-examination, ruled that certain jury instructions had been properly refused or given, and held that sufficient independent aggravating factors existed so that the jury did not impermissibly double the aggravating factors of robbery and pecuniary gain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant student's conviction for possession of a weapon on school property in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(13), the court reviewed the subsequent decision which declared that statute unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;pocketknife&quot; was not defined with sufficient definiteness. Specifically, the common pocketknife exception to the statute that prohibited possessing a weapon on school property was found to be void for vagueness, because the term pocketknife was not defined with sufficient definiteness. The court reversed the judgment, holding that in the vast majority of cases it would be evident whether one's particular knife was a common pocketknife, and therefore that term was not void for vagueness. Also, all doubts as to the validity of a statute were to be resolved in favor of constitutionality where reasonably possible, and it was reasonable that most people would understand the definition of a common pocketknife. Finally, appellant's conviction under the statute was vacated because the knife she possessed on school property was a common pocketknife and therefore the pocketknife exception to the statute applied.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that defendant never objected to the actual jury instruction at trial so it was not preserved for review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of first degree murder along with various other crimes and was sentenced to death. On review, appellant raised various contentions challenging his conviction and sentencing. The court held that the record contained competent, substantial evidence to support the convictions and affirmed the judgment of the trial court and the death sentence. The court found that the portion of the surviving victim's testimony which was reread to the jury was directly responsive to the jury's request and was not misleading and did not place undue emphasis on portions prejudicial to appellant. Because the victim-impact evidence was limited to that which was relevant under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141(7), there was no reversible error in allowing the introduction of the evidence. There was competent, substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings regarding aggravating factors. The trial court also afforded the nonstatutory mitigation factors their appropriate weight. In light of the determination regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the court found that under the proportionality review the imposition of the death penalty was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to rape, murder, and robbery. Following numerous rehearings, appellant was, for the fourth time, sentenced to death for the murder. Appellant challenged his death sentence. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed and held that appellant had full understanding of the significance of his plea and its voluntariness as required by Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.170(j). Appellant's confessions and guilty plea were properly admitted. The supreme court found its later decision on confessions and guilty pleas, rendered almost seventeen years after the plea was entered, inapplicable. Reconsideration of the law of the case was warranted only in exceptional circumstances and where reliance on the previous decision would result in manifest injustice, neither of which applied to the case in question. Appellant objected to the trial court's ordering a mental examination under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.202(d). Although Rule 3.202 became effective three years after appellant's resentencing, the supreme court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by compelling the exam.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 877.18 (1993) because he issued identification cards without having the recipients present proper proof of age as established in Fla. Stat. ch. 232.03 (1993). The district court reversed appellee's conviction because it held that Fla. Stat. ch. 877.18 (1993) was vague. The district court held that the reference to Fla. Stat. ch. 232.03 (1993), which only applied to children under 16 years old, was ambiguous as to whether the documentation requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 877.18 (1993) applied to all applicants or only those under 16 years old. On appeal, the supreme court quashed the district court's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The statute was not vague because Fla. Stat. ch. 877.18 (1993) set forth the methods of acceptable proof of age for both children and adults. The legislature would have been better served setting out the proof of age requirements, rather than referring to Fla. Stat. ch. 232.03 (1993), but the reference did not make Fla. Stat. ch. 877.18 (1993) ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Dade County (Florida), convicting him of first degree murder and sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, arguing that the evidence concerning his desire that his victim abort their child was unduly prejudicial and inadmissible under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 90.403, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession on the grounds that his right to counsel was violated when he indicated to the interrogating officers his desire to have a lawyer, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial immediately after a witness referred to defendant's purported commission of an uncharged offense. The court ruled that although &sect; 90.403 was mandatory in its exclusion of unduly prejudicial evidence, a large measure of discretion rested in the trial judge to determine whether the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Further, the court held that a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress was accorded great deference and that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion was supported by the record. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that a mistrial was not warranted based on the error by the testifying witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Gadsden County (Florida), which sentenced him to death after his conviction for first-degree murder. Appellant argued that the trial court's cold, calculated, and premeditated instruction was erroneous, and that the trial court erred in applying both the Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(d) (1991) and the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that an erroneous cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) instruction was harmless, and that the consideration of a heinous, atrocious, and cruel (HAC) aggravating factor in conjunction with the Fla. Sta. ch. 921.141(5)(d) (1991) factor did not result in improper doubling, the court affirmed appellant's death sentence. The court found that the trial court's CCP instruction was erroneous, because it did not explain that this aggravating factor required a higher degree of premeditation than that required to support a first-degree murder conviction, and also because it did not define cold and calculated. The court held that the error was harmless, however, because the trial court ultimately found that the CCP aggravator had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt, and because substantial evidence existed tending to support CCP. The court also found that there was no improper doubling of aggravators. The court noted that because the HAC aggravator was determined by reference to the victim's suffering, and not the objective circumstances of the crime, it was properly considered along with the sexual assault supporting the ch. 921.141(5)(d) aggravator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's death sentence. The court held that an erroneous cold, calculated, and premeditated instruction was subject to harmless error analysis, and held that the state had proved a lack of prejudice beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the listed felony and heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravators were properly applied in conjunction, because the latter considered the victim's suffering, not the crime per se.</SPAN></P>

Second, appellant was properly barred from admitting evidence under the reverse Williams-rule because he failed to show how the victim's boyfriend's prior bad acts were relevant.

Fourth, a prospective juror was properly excused for cause over appellant's objection because the prospective juror repeatedly expressed strong reservations about her ability to be impartial on the death penalty issue.

X, &sect; 16, which was known as the net ban amendment. The amendment restricted certain methods of net fishing. Less than two weeks before the amendment was to be effective, plaintiffs, commercial fishermen, brought an action challenging the amendment's validity on both procedural and substantive grounds. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court upheld the amendment's constitutionality. Plaintiffs appealed. The court of appeal certified the trial court order to be of great public importance requiring immediate resolution by the court. The court affirmed, holding that the rational basis test applied to the amendment because fishing was not a fundamental right and commercial fishermen were not a suspect class, the amendment did not constitute special interest legislation, the amendment did not violate due process of law or equal protection, the amendment protected the resources of the state by restricting certain methods of net fishing in a rational manner, and plaintiffs' challenge to the form of the ballot summary was untimely because it was made eight months after the amendment was adopted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the State of Florida, sought review of a question of law certified by the District Court of Appeal, Fourth District (Florida), as to whether Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 817.234(1) and (3) (1987) were unconstitutionally vague as applied to respondent attorneys in the representation of their clients because the statute did not provide adequate notice of when an omission in submitting an insurance claim would result in an &quot;incomplete&quot; claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a certified question of law, petitioner, the State of Florida, challenged whether Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 817.234(1) (1987) was unconstitutionally vague when applied to respondent attorneys. Respondents were indicted for a variety of federal and state fraud-related crimes, including insurance fraud, grand theft, perjury, and conspiracy in connection with forging medical reports and submitting false medical tests in insurance claims for clients. On appeal, the court held that by using the term &quot;incomplete,&quot; Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 817.234(1), the false and fraudulent insurance claim statute, did not provide sufficient notice of the conduct by attorneys that it proscribed and that it was subject to arbitrary enforcement when applied to attorneys in the representation of their clients. Therefore, the statute was void for vagueness. The statute also applied to third-party insurance claims. However, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 817.234(3), although also applicable to third-party claims, was not void for vagueness. The court dismissed all claims brought against respondents under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 817.234(1) but reinstated all claims under subsection (3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's dismissal of filing fraudulent insurance claim charges against respondent attorneys because the Florida statute charging the offense of insurance fraud was unconstitutionally vague when applied to attorneys representing clients. However, another subsection of the same statute was not vague, and offenses under that subsection were chargeable against respondents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Santa Rosa County (Florida), which sentenced appellant to death for first-degree murder. Appellant argued that this resentencing proceeding was tainted by the trial court's refusal to allow his counsel to withdraw, admitting cumulative, prejudicial, and irrelevant evidence, that jury instructions were inadequate, and that aggravators were doubled impermissibly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant struck co-counsel in open court during his sentencing hearing. Holding that because any prejudice resulting from the act was appellant's fault he was not entitled to a mistrial, the court affirmed the sentence. The court stated that appellant had no constitutional right to select his own court-appointed counsel, and that appellant could not benefit from a conflict of his own making. The court stated that where co-counsel was not ineffective, the denial of his motion to withdraw was not error. The court held that evidence of other crimes appellant perpetrated on the victim's sister immediately before killing the victim was properly presented to the jury. Noting that this was a resentencing remand, the court held that under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(1) (1993) evidence could be presented as to any matter that the trial court deemed relevant to the nature of the crime. The court also held that consideration of both the avoiding arrest and cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravators did not constitute improper doubling. The court held that the former related to the purpose for which the crime was committed, while the latter referred to the manner in which it was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's death sentence. The court held that the court's denials of appellant's motion for a mistrial and his counsel's request to withdraw were proper, because appellant's contumacious behavior alone was responsible for any conflict of interest. The court also held that jury instructions on aggravators were proper, as was the consideration of two aggravators based on the same facts.</SPAN></P>

The relevance of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The court held that it was not error to admit evidence of certain of defendant's collateral bad acts because the evidence was relevant, and although the acts were dissimilar to the acts for which defendant was on trial, Fla. Stat. ch. 90.402 permitted the admission of any relevant evidence unless specifically excluded by a rule of evidence. The court, however, held that it was error for the lower court to admit evidence of defendant's abusive relationship with his children because although the evidence might have been relevant to the state's case, its relevance was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect on defendant pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 90.403. The court found that the admission of such evidence was reversible error because the jury could only have been inflamed by it and might have been moved to punish defendant for the abuse by finding him guilty of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patient suffered from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and appellee physician wished to assist patient in committing suicide by intravenous means. A declaratory judgment that Fla. Stat. ch. 782.08 was unconstitutional was reversed and the constitutionality of the statute was upheld. Patient's asserted right to assistance in committing suicide was not a fundamental liberty interest. There was a logical and recognized distinction between the right to refuse medical treatment and assisted suicide. The public policy of the state as expressed by the legislature was opposed to assisted suicide. Three of the four recognized state interests were so compelling as to clearly outweigh patient's desire for assistance in committing suicide. The case was not decided on the basis of the court's own assessment of the weight of the competing moral arguments. By broadly construing the privacy amendment to include the right to assisted suicide, the court would run the risk of arrogating to itself those powers to make social policy that as a constitutional matter belonged only to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and upheld the constitutionality of the assisted suicide statute because the compelling state interests outweighed the individual's interest and the court was not in a position to usurp the legislature's social policy authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder. The jury recommended a sentence of death. The trial court relied on evidence that appellant participated in a detailed plan to kidnap a young girl using a gun, handcuffs, and rope, to transport her to his residence, commit sexual battery, terrorize, and then murder her. He also threatened to kill another girl and told her he was &quot;going to do it anyway.&quot; The jury was correctly instructed that a life sentence for the murder included eligibility for parole after twenty-five years according to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1) (1983). The cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) instruction incorporated some, but not all, of the provisions of the CCP instruction suggested in the current standard criminal jury instruction on CCP. Assuming, without deciding, that the CCP instruction as given was inadequate, the state supreme court was convinced that any error in the instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, in light of the overwhelming evidence of CCP, as well as the other circumstances of the case. The court found no error in the doubling of aggravators because the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators were based on different aspects of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in granting the state's motion for rejoinder of his trial with the co-defendant's trial. The court agreed and found that that Fla.

The court addressed defendant's other arguments in anticipation of a new trial and instructed the trial court to review application of the controlling case law precedent and Fla. R. Crim.

The trial court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced appellant to death. Appellant contended that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction for premeditated murder along with other contentions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Among other claims, appellant contended that the trial court erred in failing to exclude his own confession from evidence and admitting into evidence at their joint trial a codefendant's confession incriminating appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant participated in a robbery attempt in which a man was killed. Appellant was convicted of attempted murder, murder, and other offenses and was sentenced to death. On appeal, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to exclude his confession because the state did not independently prove the corpus delicti, in admitting a codefendant's confession, and in various other matters. On review, the appellate court found that there was a sufficient showing of the intent to commit the crime of robbery and found proof of corpus delicti. The court found that the codefendant's statements were properly admitted due to sufficient indicia of reliability where the statements were individually self-incriminatory and had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The right to confrontation was not violated. The court noted that initial confessions without those qualifiers were improperly admitted but that the error was harmless. The attempted murder convictions were vacated and the charges were remanded because the record did not show whether the jury relied on an impermissible theory, attempted first-degree felony murder. The other convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated appellant's attempted murder convictions and remanded the charges where it was impossible to tell whether the jury improperly convicted him of attempted felony murder, which did not exist. The court affirmed the remaining convictions and sentences. Appellant was not denied his right to confrontation where codefendant's statements were individually self-incriminatory and had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the death sentence and remanded for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Appellant had asserted the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant's motion to suppress evidence. The court found that appellant's initial encounter with Mississippi officers was consensual because appellant and his co-defendant had just accepted help from the officers when they were wet and lost in an unfamiliar area. They agreed to go to jail to sleep and dry their clothes, but they were always free to leave. There was no error by the court in denying suppression of the knife that was used to kill the victim. Appellant had given the knife to the officers before going to jail for the night. The court vacated the death penalty and remanded because the mitigating circumstances of extreme alcohol abuse, drinking from an early age, and having an abnormal reaction to alcohol had not been considered by the court as mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed the evidence and determined that the challenged evidence distracted the jury from the facts of the case being tried. Extensive details of defendant's shooting of the police officer were offered by several witnesses, and along with photographs of the officer's injuries were so inflammatory that they could have unfairly prejudiced the jury against defendant. The admission of such evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court therefore reversed defendant's sentence and conviction, and remanded the matter for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The jury was entitled to believe the testimony of appellant's acquaintance that appellant told him about the murder, and the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The trial court properly refused to allow the acquaintance's brother to testify as to his opinion of the acquaintance's truthfulness because it was not admissible reputation evidence. The trial court's denial of appellant's motion to sanction the prosecution's witnesses for violating witness sequestration was not an abuse of discretion where the witnesses were unaware that sequestration was in effect and the conversation did not cause any of them to change their testimony. The torture of the woman supported the finding that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The jury properly found that appellant planned to rob the victim, planned to kill her after realizing that she could identify him, and deliberately taped her and searched the house for valuables before killing her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of appellant county and appellant city approved an bond ordinance levying a surtax in order to finance a new stadium primarily for the use of the local professional football team, although the stadium would host other events. Appellee taxpayer claimed that the bonds were invalid under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10(c). The trial court found that the new stadium would serve the public but invalidated the bond because under the terms of finance, the professional football organization would receive $ 2 million in revenue from events other than professional football games. On appeal, the court reversed and validated the bond. The private benefit to the football team was incidental to the greater public purpose, and the bond thus did not violate Fla. Const. art.

The trial court denied the petition. Appellant claimed error in the trial court's refusal to admit certain evidence that would establish his claim. Appellant sought all writs jurisdiction from the appellate court. The court vacated the stay and held that there was competent substantial evidence in the record to support the order of the trial judge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI), entered a no contest plea, and was placed on probation after being adjudicated guilty. The trial court declined to impose the impoundment provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(6)(d), holding the provision was unconstitutional. Appellant state filed an appeal and the appellate court affirmed the trial court's reasoning and held that the aforementioned provision unconstitutionally vague and provided no mechanism for enforcement and failed to define mobilization. Appellant challenged the appellate court's decision. The court reversed the lower court's decision and reasoned that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(6)(d) provided notice that upon a DUI conviction, appellee's vehicle would be impounded. The vehicle impoundment clause only set forth an additional penalty if convicted of a DUI. Moreover, the court reasoned the appellate court's contention that the statute lacked of an enforcement mechanism did not render it unconstitutionally vague or unenforceable. Additionally, appellee's arguments that his equal protection and due process rights were violated as a consequence of the impoundment provision were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, county residents in a class action suit, challenged the validity of four ordinances that levied special assessments for garbage services, landfill closure, ambulance service, and fire protection. The trial court ruled that the ordinances were invalid and that plaintiffs were entitled to refunds for three out of five years with interest. The district court affirmed the judgment regarding refunds but reversed the judgment regarding interest because no final money judgment had been entered on the refunds. The court held that the district court did not err in determining that plaintiffs were only entitled to tax refunds for three out of the five years in question. The assessments for the first two years were non-discriminatory and conferred a commensurate benefit on plaintiffs. The county also acted in good faith in imposing these assessments. Thus, equitable considerations precluded a refund for those two years. The court also disagreed with plaintiffs that the county should be required to pay interest on the refunds from the latter three years. Plaintiffs were not presently entitled to postjudgment interest because the amount owed was still indeterminate.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of first-degree murder, among other things, and sentenced to death. The death sentence was vacated and the matter was remanded. The trial court again imposed the death sentence at resentencing. On appeal, the court held that the denial of appellant's motion to disqualify the trial judge was proper. The motion was filed almost 3 months after learning of the grounds for disqualification, long after the required 10 day filing period had expired. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in finding several aggravating circumstances. The murder was committed to avoid arrest because there was little reason to kill the victim except for the fact that she was a witness. Additionally, because of the aggravating circumstances of the commission of arson and the commission for pecuniary gain were unrelated, they did not constitute improper doubling. Finding the remaining arguments to be meritless, the court affirmed the order imposing the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in applying the heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) aggravator as to the murder of the strangulation victim and in rejecting the statutory mitigator that defendant was under the influence of extreme mental disturbance at the time of the murders. The appellate court affirmed the sentence, holding that the HAC aggravator was appropriate for the strangulation because the victim opened her eyes and looked at defendant as he grabbed her neck. The victim died quickly, but she was conscious of her impending death, and the terror of the victim during events leading up to a murder could make an otherwise quick death especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The appellate court also held that the trial court did not err in rejecting the extreme mental disturbance mitigator. The trial court determined that defendant was under the influence of a moderate mental disturbance at the time of the murders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's motions to suppress hair and DNA evidence, the Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida) entered a judgment convicting defendant of first degree murder, burglary with an assault, and sexual battery. Defendant appealed, raising 23 claims of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his convictions for first degree murder, burglary with an assault, and sexual battery, defendant appealed. Inter alia, defendant asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to suppress hair evidence seized pursuant to an allegedly defective search warrant and in allowing the state's expert to testify about the results of DNA typing. Despite finding that the trial court reasonably could have denied defendant's motion to suppress hair evidence on the ground that a detective's testimony that defendant voluntarily consented to give a hair sample was more credible than defendant's testimony to the contrary, the court reversed and remanded. The Frye test for admissibility of scientific evidence was not met where the trial court failed to conduct the step-by-step inquiry as to whether either the polymerase chain reaction method of DNA typing used by the state's expert, or the probability calculations used to report the test results, could be admitted at the trial. Thus, the state failed to prove the general acceptance of both the underlying scientific principle and the testing procedures used to apply that principle to the facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to suppress hair evidence, the court reversed and remanded defendant's convictions and sentences for first degree murder, burglary with an assault, and sexual battery because the trial court did abuse its discretion in admitting DNA evidence that did not meet the Frye standard for admissibility. Thus, defendant's remaining claims of error were rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court, Orange County (Florida) convicting him of first-degree murder, two counts of sexual battery, attempted sexual battery, and attempted burglary with an assault. Appellant also sought review of his death sentence alleging numerous points of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. In support of his death sentence, the trial court found statutory aggravating factors. Appellant's aggravating factors were that he had been convicted of a prior violent felony, the murder was committed during the commission of a sexual battery, and the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. Appellant alleged that the trial court improperly allowed the joinder of his offenses against the victim with those against another attempted victim. The court held that appellant's offenses constituted a crime spree and were properly joined in one trial. The court found that the aborted entry into the witness' car, the actual rape, and the extreme violence of the murder demonstrated a meaningful relationship between the two attacks so as to justify joinder of the offenses. Prior to trial, appellant objected to appellee state's proposed introduction of six slides of the victim's body. The court held that admission of the photographs was proper and did not unfairly prejudice appellant. The court upheld the death sentence finding it proportional to other cases in which sentences of death had been imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions and his death sentence. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in consolidating all five counts in the information into one trial. The court concluded that the slides of the victim's body were not unfairly prejudicial because they were necessary in order for the location and extent of the victim's wounds to be accurately explained to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed the death penalty. Appellant challenged his conviction and death sentence, raising nine issues on appeal.

As to appellant's alleged discovery error in the guilt phase, although the court disagreed with the trial court's analysis in excluding testimony, it agreed with the result, and there was no Richardson violation. The court did not find appellant's ability to prepare for trial was compromised. The court also did not err in restricting appellant's cross examination or in refusing to allow him to testify on redirect about his offer to plead. As to the penalty phase, the court did err in failing to expressly evaluate, find, and weigh unrebutted mitigation, and the sentencing order contained inadequate discussion of the mitigation offered. The court remanded for entry of a new sentencing order expressly discussing and weighing the evidence offered in mitigation according to the terms the court outlined in cases like Campbell.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Alachua County (Florida), sentencing him to death after adjudicating him guilty of each of five murders and holding a penalty phase proceeding pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141 (1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to five murders, and the trial court imposed five death sentences following a penalty phase proceeding pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141 (1). Defendant appealed, arguing the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motions for a change of venue, to suppress statements, to sever and conduct separate sentencing proceedings, to suppress physical evidence, that the trial court erred in finding as an aggravating circumstance that one of the homicides was especially heinous, and the trial court erred by giving an unconstitutional jury instruction. The court ruled that neither pretrial publicity nor a lengthy jury selection process evidenced a community bias so pervasive as to make it impossible to seat an impartial jury. Further, the court held that defendant's right to counsel was not violated because his statements were not a product of a strategem designed to elicit an incriminating statement. Also, the court found that an inventory search of defendant's bag was reasonable under the circumstances. The court affirmed the sentences, concluding that the murders were properly joined and that the jury instruction was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment sentencing defendant to death was affirmed where the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a change of venue, defendant's incriminatory statements to the police were in no way the product of the state's strategem deliberately designed to elicit an incriminating statement from him, and physical evidence recovered from defendant's totebag was properly admitted against him.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed the summary judgment granted to respondent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder, kidnapping, and armed robbery. In his death sentence appeal, where appellant failed to timely object, issues on jury instructions and ineffective assistance of counsel were not preserved for appeal. The introduction of a witness' prior trial testimony was harmless error because it was hearsay only if appellant was not given a fair opportunity to rebut the testimony. The court concluded that he had fair opportunity and rejected his contention that admission of the testimony required vacation of his death sentence. The prosecutor's biblical references during closing did not amount to fundamental error. The court found that the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain. Therefore, the court upheld the lower court's finding of the pecuniary gain aggravator and found that the lower court properly evaluated mitigating factors. Finally, in affirming, the court concluded that death was still a proper and proportionate sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vehicle owners sought review of an order of the Trial Court in and for Orange County (Florida), which denied appellants' motion for an award of postjudgment interest after the trial court ordered appellee revenue department to refund vehicle impact fees that were collected from appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vehicle owners commenced a class action lawsuit against appellee revenue department, contending that a vehicle impact fee, Fla. Stat. ch. 319.231 (1991), was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional and ordered appellee to refund payments to appellants. Appellants moved for and were denied postjudgment interest, following the trial court's order for attorney fees and expenses. Appellants challenged the denial and contended they were entitled to postjudgment interest pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 55.03(2) when a final judgment was created ordering attorney fees and expenses. Appellee argued that no final money judgment resulted, the statute was inapplicable to tax refunds, sovereign immunity applied and had not been waived, and there was no evidence of appellee's unreasonableness regarding refunds. The supreme court affirmed the order and held that appellants were not entitled to postjudgment interest when no final money judgment existed. Moreover, the court reasoned that appellants would only be entitled to interest if appellee did not exercise reasonable diligence in issuing refunds to appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court denying appellant vehicle owners' motion for postjudgment interest was affirmed. Postjudgment interest was not warranted when appellants never obtained a final money judgment against appellee revenue department. Additionally, the court noted that appellee would only have to pay postjudgment interest if it did not exercise reasonable diligence in the refund process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state obtained direct appeal of a judgment from the trial court, in and for Leon County (Florida), which granted appellee unions' motion for summary judgment, and ordered certain benefits restored pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Appellant contended that the trial court's judgment was invalid because it was based on a quashed order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state employees' union obtained certain benefits via collective bargaining. The state legislature effectively rescinded the agreement, and ordered certain accrued benefits forfeited. In a prior appeal, it had been determined that collective bargaining agreements entered on behalf of public employees were subject to the appropriations power of the legislature, which was not bound to fund any agreed-to program, except where the legislature provided enough money to implement the negotiated program but attempted to unilaterally change the benefit. On remand, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, reinstated the agreement, and awarded back benefits. The court affirmed the judgment in part, and reversed it in part. The court dismissed appellant's contention that the order was beset by jurisdictional defects. Noting the complicated procedural history, the court held that the order was valid. The court restricted the scope of the order, however, to effect the terms of the original bargaining agreement for only one year, because appellees had concluded new agreements that had superceded and cancelled all prior agreements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court held that appellant state's jurisdictional attack on the judgment was misplaced. The court restricted the effect of the judgment to the period after the agreement went into effect and before it was superceded by further bargaining.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Orange and Bradford Counties (Florida), which denied his motions for postconviction relief. Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly denied him an oral hearing on his motion for stay of execution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's death sentence and convictions for first-degree murder and auto theft were affirmed because defendant was competent to stand trial, however, where conflicting evidence existed as to his competency to be executed, an evidentiary hearing was required. Defendant was convicted of murdering his neighbor. Defendant brought appeals at both the state and federal level, which were denied. Defendant brought a motion for postconviction relief and claimed he was not competent to proceed at a previous postconviction hearing and was incompetent to be executed. The reviewing court reversed in part and stayed defendant's execution. Because conflicting expert opinions existed as to whether defendant was competent to be executed, an evidentiary hearing was required. Because defense counsel was notified of a hearing to determine defendant's competency to proceed in postconviction matters and failed to present live witnesses, the court did not abuse its discretion by accepting live testimony of the witnesses present and by accepting the affidavits of defendant's experts. Because the trial court applied the correct standard at the hearing, defendant's convictions were upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida), which sentenced him to death. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the murder for pecuniary gain aggravator and in finding the aggravator; erred in giving the standard jury instruction to define the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator and in finding the aggravator, and that sentence was disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to death for murdering a used car salesman's daughter during the course of an attempted murder of the salesman. Finding no error in the application of aggravating factors, the court affirmed. The court held that a pecuniary gain instruction was warranted, and that the evidence supported the finding of this aggravator. The court held that the evidence showed that appellant had bounced a check in connection with the purchase of a vehicle, and that the murder was committed in connection with an attempt to avoid having to make good the check. The court held that appellant had waived his objection to the cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) aggravator. Noting appellant's pretrial motions regarding CCP, the court held that appellant had not properly preserved the issue by making a specific objection to the instruction as worded or offering a limiting or alternative instruction. In any event, the court found any error in the instruction obviated, because the murder was the result of cool reflection, carefully planned and premeditated, and without pretense of moral or legal justification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's death sentence. The court held that the evidence supported findings of both the pecuniary gain and cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) aggravators. The court held that appellant had failed to preserve the issue of the constitutionality of the CCP instruction given, because he had not specifically objected to the instruction as worded, nor offered any alternative or limiting instruction.</SPAN></P>

The court answered the certified question in the affirmative, quashed the appellate court's decision, and remanded the case with directions for a finding by the trial court as to the sufficiency of the evidence on the greater offense. The court held that there was some evidence regarding the legality of the arrest and that, therefore, the trial court properly gave the instruction on the lesser-included offense. The court ruled that a defendant who requested an instruction on a lesser-included offense could contest the sufficiency of the evidence on the lesser-included offense only when the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant on the greater charge as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After affirming a trial court's holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 943.059(2) (1993) was unconstitutional because the eligibility certificate and fee requirements for sealing nonjudicial criminal records were procedural in nature, the Second District Court of Appeal, Collier County (Florida), certified for review questions relating to the legislative and judicial requirements for sealing records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent filed a petition under Fla. R. Crim. P.  3.692 and Fla. Stat. ch. 943.059 (1993) to seal all of respondent's judicial and nonjudicial criminal history records. The trial court sealed all court records and ordered law enforcement agencies to seal nonjudicial records, concluding that the certificate and fee requirements for sealing nonjudicial records were procedural in nature and, therefore, Fla. Stat. ch. 943.059(2) (1993), was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling, but certified for review questions relating to legislative requirements and court standards for sealing records. On review, the court concluded that the ch. 943.059(2) requirements did not violate separation of powers, Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3, or the court's rulemaking authority, Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2, because creating such requirements was within the legislature's exclusive control. The court then found that a court was not required to apply the constitutional test set out in relevant case law before it sealed judicial records pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.692 as long as the court addressed that rule's requirements and those of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.989.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision that found the Florida statute that established certificate and fee requirements as conditions precedent to sealing nonjudicial records unconstitutional and remanded the case. The court held that creating such requirements was within the legislature's exclusive control. The court also held that a court did not have to apply the constitutional test set out in relevant case law before it sealed judicial records.</SPAN></P>

In denying the petition, the court held that all of petitioner's claims were either procedurally barred because they had already been examined on the merits on direct appeal or in petitioner's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 proceeding, because they could have been but were not raised in an earlier proceeding, or because the claims were meritless.</SPAN></P>

The court held that granting the requested stay would allow respondent department of corrections to continue implementing the administrative rule that the United States Supreme Court had held was clearly unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(c) (1993) provided that the sale or possession of cocaine with the intent to sell, although otherwise a second-degree felony, was a first-degree felony if the crime was committed within 1,000 feet of a school and occurred between the hours of 6 a.m. and 12 a.m. Petitioner was convicted under the statute for selling cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school and for possessing cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school with the intent to sell. The relevant incidents occurred at 7:28 p.m. and 1:20 p.m. The court reviewed a district court of appeal decision that expressly declared that the statute was constitutionally valid. Approving the decision, the court rejected petitioner's argument on appeal that the term &quot;12 a.m.&quot; in the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to put reasonable persons on notice as to whether the period of time in which an offense was subject to reclassification ended at noon or midnight. The court held that in context 12 a.m. meant midnight, and that the statute covered the 18-hour period from 6 a.m. until 12 a.m.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the district court of appeal decision that expressly declared that the statute was constitutionally valid, because the term &quot;12 a.m.&quot; in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court addressed a certified question from the district court. The issue was whether a trial judge, upon revocation of probation, could lawfully impose an habitual felony offender sentence, despite having declined to impose such a sentence at the original proceeding. The answer was no. Petitioner was convicted of burglary and robbery, which were punishable as provided in Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082, 775.083, and 775.084 (1989). The original sentencing judge explicitly rejected the habitual offender sentencing option and imposed a guidelines sentence under ch. 775.082, which specified the maximum imprisonment term for each offense classification. The sentencing judge could impose an habitual offender sentence or a guidelines sentence, but not both. Having served the imprisonment portion of his sentence under the guidelines, petitioner could not be sentenced as an habitual offender on revocation of probation. The hybrid sentence must be reversed. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701(d)(14) required sentences imposed after revocation of probation be in accordance with the guidelines. The court disapproved Davis to the extent it was inconsistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of possession of cocaine, Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(f) (1991), and possession of drug paraphernalia, ch. 893.147(1) (1995). Petitioner appealed, contending that the information should have been dismissed because neither count contained the essential element of knowledge, and that the court should have instructed the jury that the state had to prove he knew the substance he possessed was cocaine, and the object he possessed was drug paraphernalia. The district court rejected these contentions, but reversed on several sentencing issues. The court quashed the decision below. The court held that the state was required to prove that petitioner knew of the illicit nature of the items he possessed under ch. 893.13(6)(a) and 893.147(1), and that petitioner was entitled to a specific jury instruction on knowledge as requested, and remanded. Guilty knowledge must be established in a simple drug possession case. The legislature would not ordinarily criminalize the &quot;innocent&quot; possession of illegal drugs. Silence did not suggest that the legislature dispensed with scienter here. However, the information was not defective because it tracked the language in each statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Martin County (Florida), which denied his motion for postconviction relief related to a death warrant issued for his murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to being sentenced to death for his murder conviction, appellant argued that his death warrant should be stayed pending resolution of a hearing involving a codefendant. Appellant argued that, if the codefendant's death sentence was reduced, appellant's death sentence would be improperly disproportional. However, the court rejected appellant's argument, holding that appellant's death sentence would be proper even if his codefendant's sentence was reduced, in light of appellant's predominant role in the crime and appellant's prior history. The court then held that appellant's failure to object at the trial level to an instruction to his sentencing jury precluded his challenge to the instruction on appeal, despite the fact that the instruction had been found unconstitutionally vague. Thus, the court upheld the denial of appellant's claim for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying appellant's motion for postconviction relief was affirmed because appellant's role in the murder for which he was convicted warranted imposition of the death penalty, and appellant's failure to object to a jury instruction at the trial level precluded his challenge to the instruction on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a drug store chain, sought review of a decision of the District Court of Appeal (Florida), which determined that a portion of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a drug store chain, were subject to Fla. Stat. ch. 408.706(10), which set up community health purchasing alliances, required independent pharmacies to provide service at the same (or a lesser) rate as a contract pharmacy, and required them to meet any other qualifications necessary for participation in the specific health partnership. Petitioners asserted that the statute illegally limited certain Florida-based companies' access by barring both all pharmacies licensed under another state's law and all pharmacies with more than 12 Florida locations. The lower court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 408.706(10) did not violate the Commerce Clause. The court affirmed, holding that there was no discrimination against out-of-state businesses because they were treated the same as in-state businesses under the statute. The court ruled that the critical consideration was the overall effect of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding of constitutionality of a statute containing an exemption for independent pharmacies.

Appellant sought review, alleging discovery violations, wrongful admission of evidence relating to a collateral burglary, prosecutorial misconduct regarding a suicide defense, and sentencing errors.

The appellate court found that a collateral burglary committed by appellant was closely connected to the murder and was part of the entire context of the crime. The court indicated that the trial court properly admitted details of the burglary because it was inextricably intertwined with the murder but the state's use of the facts from the burglary exceeded the scope for which they were admitted. While the prosecutor's comments about those facts was error, it was harmless. The court found that that appellant opened the door to prosecutorial comment on suicide and there was no misconduct.

Because of the threats, the witness took three years to identify appellant, which left the witness's credibility in question. Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed burglary, extortion, attempted murder, armed kidnapping, and armed robbery and sentenced to death. On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred in admitting prior crimes evidence during the guilt phase, in not severing the extortion count, and in admitting documentary evidence. Appellant also claimed there was insufficient evidence and that there were sentencing errors. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that, because the witness's credibility was at issue, evidence regarding appellant's threats to the witness was admissible. The court found the documentary evidence admissible to prove appellant's identity. The court also found sufficient evidence to support the verdict and that the mitigating factors were subject to scrutiny because questioning was needed to clarify the effects of those circumstances on appellant.</SPAN></P>

Two days later, appellant lured the victim to a place where they kidnapped the victim, and one of the co-defendants shot the victim. The trial judge sentenced appellant to death after finding and giving great weight to aggravating circumstances. He gave slight weight to the mitigating circumstance that appellant was not the actual shooter because he used his friendship with the victim to lure the victim to his death. On appeal numerous issues were raised in the guilt and penalty phase. The court remanded his habitual offender sentences to be ordered to run concurrently rather than consecutively. The only other argument the court agreed with was that the trial judge erred in finding that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel. However, the court found this error to be harmless in light of the remaining aggravating factors (cold, contemplated and premeditated, prior violent felonies, committed during the course of a kidnapping, and committed for financial gain) and minimal mitigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed a decision of the District Court of Appeal, Duval County (Florida) and addressed a certified question regarding grandparental visitation rights and the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(e) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court addressed a certified question on grandparental visitation rights. The question asked whether Fla. Stat. ch. 752.01(1)(e) (1993) was facially unconstitutional because it constituted impermissible state interference with parental rights protected by either Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 or the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV? The answer was yes. Based on the Florida Constitution's privacy provision, the court held that the state could not intrude on parents' fundamental right to raise their children except where the child was threatened by harm. The court limited its holding to situations where a child was living with both natural parents, and at least one parent objected to the visitation. The court struck the section and quashed the court of appeal's decision that the statute was constitutional. The challenged paragraph's major flaw was its failure to require a showing of harm to the child before any award of grandparental visitation rights. This requirement resulted in the state being unable to satisfy the compelling interest standard announced in the court's decisions construing Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the affirmative and determined that the state may not constitutionally impose grandparental visitation on an intact family after at least one parent has objected to such visitation without first demonstrating harm to the child. The court quashed the district court of appeal's decision and remanded with directions to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal, Second District (Florida) certified for review the question of whether it had authority, under Fla. Stat. ch. 741.30(8)(a), to prevent the circuit court from exercising its power of indirect criminal contempt to punish petitioner for violating a domestic violence injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought to prevent the circuit court from exercising its power of indirect criminal contempt to punish his alleged violation of a domestic violence injunction. In denying the petition, the district court found that the legislature had no authority to limit a circuit court's inherent power of contempt, as it apparently attempted to do by restricting its jurisdiction to the use of civil contempt in enforcing injunctions issued under Fla. Stat. ch. 741.30. The court held that its power to punish for contempt was inherent and independent of any statutory grant of authority. Although the legislature could limit sanctions, it could not eliminate the ability of circuit courts to apply its inherent power of civil or criminal contempt and any attempt to do so directly affected the separate and distinct function of the judicial branch. Thus, in interpreting the statute so that it would withstand constitutional scrutiny, the court interpreted the phrase &quot;shall enforce, through a civil contempt proceeding&quot; in Fla. Stat. ch. 741.30(8)(a) as directory rather than mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court responded that the word &quot;shall&quot; was directory and not mandatory and that the circuit court could enforce its domestic violence injunction by way of an indirect criminal contempt proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, at the age of 60, asserted she was the natural daughter of decedent and filed a petition for revocation of probate and letters of administration, alleging decedent lacked testamentary capacity and that undue influence had been exerted. The trial court dismissed respondent's claim, holding it was barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(b), the statute of limitations for adjudication of paternity. The appellate court reversed and held that under Fla. Stat. ch. 732.108(2)(b), respondent could bring a paternity action in probate for the purpose of establishing her right to intestate succession. Petitioners filed a motion for rehearing which the court granted. The court held that the fact that paternity may be adjudicated in the course of probate proceedings did not mean that &sect; 95.11(3)(b) was inapplicable because there was no provision in the probate code that removed paternity adjudications brought in probate from the general statute of limitations. Further, the court held the statute began to run when the child reached the age of majority. The court therefore quashed the decision below and reinstated the trial court's judgment of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant raised 12 issues pertaining to both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. Addressing each of the issues raised by defendant, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Reviewing the voir dire, the court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing for cause a juror for her views on the death penalty. Moreover, the court affirmed the admission of hearsay statements under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, holding that there was sufficient evidence, apart from any hearsay statements, of a conspiracy. Addressing defendant's sentence, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant consumers filed suit against appellee manufacturer after appellant husband was injured using appellee's product.

On certification, the state supreme court held that appellants were entitled to sue because they could rely upon state precedent which for a time deemed the statute of repose, Fla.

Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 and that certain provisions of the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 409.910 (1995), were unconstitutional. The parties filed cross-appeals, and the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified that the judgment required immediate resolution by the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the governor ordered relevant executive branch officials to recover Medicaid expenditures only from the tobacco industry, appellee association sought a declaratory judgment that the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act (the Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 409.910 (1995), was unconstitutional and that appellant agency was structured in violation of the Florida Constitution. When the trial court found significant portions of the Act unconstitutional, the appellate court certified the parties' appeal. The court partially affirmed and reversed, holding that appellant's structure did not violate the 25 department limitation in Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6. The court then held that the Act's abrogation of affirmative defenses was facially constitutional, but this did not preclude a later action challenging the Act's application. Moreover, the authority to pursue an action without identifying individual Medicaid recipients had to be stricken; the abolition of a statute-of-repose defense was ineffective to revive time-barred claims; and the provision for combining theories of market share liability and joint and several liability had to be stricken even though either theory could be used separately.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court set plaintiff's auto negligence action for trial and ordered mediation. Fifteen days after mediation and 11 days before trial, defendants served an offer of judgment for $ 15,001, which plaintiff rejected. The case went to trial, and the jury ruled in plaintiff's favor for $ 15,000. The verdict was reduced by collateral sources to $ 5,000. Thereafter, defendants moved to assess costs and attorney fees pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 (1989). The trial court denied the motion as untimely. The lower court reversed and then certified the question of whether the time requirements in Fla. Stat. ch. 44.102 (1993) represented an unconstitutional intrusion of the legislature on the rule-making authority of the Supreme Court of Florida. The lower court's question was based upon its conclusion that &sect; 44.102(6)(b) enlarges the time to serve an offer of judgment in a case in which a court-ordered mediation has taken place. The reviewing court held that &sect; 44.102(6) was unconstitutional, and hence an offer of judgment made after an unsuccessful mediation still had to comply with the time requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 768.79 (1989) as incorporated into Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner appealed his conviction, which was affirmed by the lower court on the ground that there need not be stolen property to sustain a conviction. Thereafter, the lower court certified the question of whether it was necessary to prove the existence of stolen property in order to convict under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.019(1) (1995). On appeal, the court quashed the decision and remanded to the trial court to vacate petitioner's conviction because the requisite criminal intent was not proven. Noting that petitioner was never given an opportunity to view or inspect the property to determine if he would purchase it, the court ruled that there had to be some actual property which formed the basis of the charge whether or not it was actually stolen, or otherwise proving intent was problematic.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery and sentenced to death. On appeal, he raised nine issues. The court affirmed his convictions and death sentence. The trial court did not err by admitting excited utterances made to the neighbor and police, dying declarations made to the paramedic, or photographs of the victim's bloody clothes as their relevance was not so shocking as to outweigh their probative value. Evidence that he battered the victim several months before the murder should not have been admitted, but the error was harmless. Appellant was not entitled to a limiting instruction that the battery was relevant solely to prove motive because he failed to ask for one. His jury selection arguments failed as he failed to show an objectionable juror was selected. Florida's death penalty statute was not unconstitutional, and his sentence was proportional. Appellant's various remaining arguments lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction for murder, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing regarding a witness's recanting of her testimony.

The court reasoned that, in light of the newly discovered evidence, the trial court was permitted to deny post-conviction relief without a hearing only if the case conclusively showed defendant was not entitled to such relief. The court noted the trial court failed to explain its reasoning for denying a hearing and held the denial was erroneous. The court then held that the trial court erred in refusing, without explanation, to hear defendant's motion to compel witness responses to depositions concerning public records.

A complaint was filed with appellant ethics commission, alleging that appellee had accepted the memberships in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(4).

The court affirmed appellant's convictions and non-capital sentences, but vacated his death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding because the trial court erroneously excused for cause a qualified juror. That alone required the court to vacate the death sentence. Under controlling authority of the U.S. Supreme Court, it was reversible error to exclude for cause a juror whose views did not prevent or substantially impair him or her from performing the duties as a juror in accordance with the instructions and oath. The juror could follow her instructions and oath, and was qualified to serve under the Witherspoon-Witt standard. As to appellee's cross appeal, on remand it could present victim impact evidence that comported with the Payne case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction for first-degree murder and the resulting death penalty. After addressing each of appellant's issues, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held, inter alia, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding reputation testimony against one of the state's key witnesses. The court held that the trial judge had wide discretion in admitting or excluding the reputation testimony and that the exclusion of this evidence did not have an effect on the outcome of the jury's verdict. The court also found that although the &quot;doctrine of completeness&quot; was violated by the trial court's ruling that the defense had to show prejudice, the error was harmless because there was no reasonable probability that exclusion of the redacted statements affected the jury's verdict. The trial court's finding that the murder was both cold, calculated, and premeditated, and committed for financial gain, was not error because the facts in a given case could support multiple aggravating factors provided the factors were not based on the same essential feature of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court, Orange County (Florida), which imposed the death sentence upon him after a second remand for resentencing. Appellant was convicted for the strangulation murder of his brother's thirteen-year-old stepdaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for the strangulation murder of a 13-year-old girl and was sentenced to death. The sentence was affirmed by the state appellate court. However, it was vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court. On remand, the death sentence was again imposed. That sentence was also vacated. In the third sentencing proceeding the jury unanimously recommended the death penalty, which the trial court imposed. The court reversed and remanded, finding the trial court erred in allowing evidence that portrayed appellant as a pedophile. The court held this evidence was erroneously made a feature of the resentencing proceeding, was prejudicial, and deprived appellant of a fair sentencing. The court found that the trial court's instruction to the jury, which indicated appellant had been previously sentenced to death and that the sentence was overturned on appeal, was improper. The court held that comments regarding appellant's eligibility for parole after 25 years if a life sentence was imposed were improper because of the elapsed time between the conviction and sentencing. The court found the 17-year delay between conviction and sentencing did not violate appellant's speedy trial rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The imposition of the death sentence was reversed and the matter remanded for resentencing because evidence portraying appellant as a pedophile, including unverified allegations of appellant's sexual abuse of a number of children, was erroneously made a feature of his resentencing proceeding. This evidence was prejudicial and deprived appellant of a fair sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an insured and her husband, challenged a Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) decision in favor of respondent insurer, which reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in their declaratory action. Petitioners claimed that the appellate court's ruling incorrectly held that the trial court's retrospective application of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727(6) (Supp. 1992) was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an insured and her husband, sought payment from an underinsured motorist. The motorist's insurance company made a settlement offer. Petitioners informed respondent insurer of the offer. Respondent denied permission to settle and declined to pay the amount the motorist had offered. Petitioners still settled with the motorist and sought to recover from respondent, who refused to pay. Petitioners brought a declaratory judgment action against respondent, and the trial court granted summary judgment for petitioners, which obligated respondent to pay them. Respondent appealed the ruling. The appellate court held that retrospective application of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727(6) to a pending insurance claim unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of contract contrary to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Petitioners challenged this reversal by arguing to the court that the trial court's application of ch. 627.727(6) was constitutional. Based on this statute's history, the court determined that it was a substantive prospective statute and therefore declined to reach the constitutional issues. The court disagreed with the appellate court's reasoning, but affirmed its result for respondent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that because the victim was severely beaten and conscious after the fatal wound was inflicted, the murder was heinous. Because defendant failed to prove the elements for a continuance, the motion was properly denied. Cross-examination did not exceed the scope of direct because defendant opened the door to questions regarding defendant's link to the murder. Because an expert witness who did not perform the victim's autopsy testified to the cause of death, this testimony was admissible in that it was the expert's opinion in response to facts disclosed at trial. Although the trial court improperly found the murder was premeditated, this was harmless error because other aggravators existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner filed a civil complaint for disclosure of public records. Appellee Attorney General made the records available for viewing by appellant's counsel, but withheld certain documents. The lower court ruled the withheld documents either were not public records or were statutorily exempt from disclosure and dismissed the claim for possible Brady material in the withheld documents. In affirming the decision on appeal, the court held that handwritten documents fell under the work product exemption pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(3)(1), which was remedial in nature and therefore retroactive. It also ruled that the work product exemption applied equally whether a death-sentenced person was represented by private counsel or state-appointed counsel. Since the statute applied to all death-sentenced inmates, there was no constitutional violation. The court also found that Brady had no application to clemency proceedings and that clemency materials were not subject to disclosure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were each charged with misdemeanor battery involving domestic violence. Petitioners sought a writ of prohibition alleging that the continuing assignment of the judge was unconstitutional. The district court denied the petitions. On appeal, the supreme court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review the administrative assignment. Nonetheless, the supreme court denied petitioners' writ. The supreme court held that a county court judge could be assigned to hear circuit court work on a temporary, regular basis, provided the assignment was directed to a specified, limited class of cases, was used to maximize the efficient administration of justice, and required the county judges to supplement and aid the circuit court judges rather than to replace them. The supreme court found that the assignment of the judge to handle a limited number of county court domestic violence misdemeanors was appropriate because the assignment was directed to a specified class of cases, was used to maximize the efficient administration of justice, and supplemented and assisted the domestic violence county court judge rather than replace him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, petitioners were charged with theft of electricity in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 812.14 (1991). A trial court dismissed the charges against one of the petitioners holding that the statute created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption. The district court reversed, holding that trial court erred in determining the constitutionality of the statute facially rather than applied because the statute created a permissive inference as opposed to a mandatory rebuttable presumption. In consolidated appeals, petitioners challenged the district court's decision. The state supreme court agreed with the district court that the statute created a permissive inference rather than a mandatory rebuttable presumption and that the constitutionality of the statute must therefore be determined as applied rather than facially. The state supreme court determined that a rational connection existed between the facts in the record and the ultimate fact to be presumed because it was more likely than not that petitioners violated the statute. Therefore, the state supreme court held that the permissive inference was constitutional and affirmed the district court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and principal to aggravated assault, and received a death sentence. On appeal, he raised 18 claims. The court affirmed appellant's convictions but vacated his death sentence, and reduced his sentence to life imprisonment without eligibility of parole for 25 years. Appellant's death penalty was disproportionate, and this issue was dispositive of all his other penalty-phase claims. The proportionality review required the court to consider the totality of the circumstances and to compare the case with other capital cases. The court concluded that the circumstances did not meet the Dixon test to extract the death penalty for only the most aggravated and indefensible of crimes. The court found only one valid aggravator, no statutory mitigators, and minimal nonstatutory mitigation. It was clear that the murder took place during a robbery. But the circumstances surrounding the actual shooting were unclear. There was evidence in the record to support the theory that this was a robbery gone bad. The court could not conclusively determine what transpired immediately before the shooting.</SPAN></P>

However, the DOC was found not to have abused its discretion by not awarding respondent the maximum amount of gain-time available.

Appellant had attempted to provoke the victim into a fight but the victim had refused. Appellant came after the victim stating he would teach him how to bleed. Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, and the jury recommended death. The trial court found as aggravating factors that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel and that appellant had previous felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence. The trial court sentenced appellant to death. The court affirmed the conviction and found that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial after the lead detective made reference to a prior trial. The court found that the failure of the detective to preserve certain evidence was not a denial of due process because the evidence was neither material nor exculpatory. The court remanded for resentencing and held that the trial court erred in considering a prior juvenile adjudication as an aggravating factor because it was not a conviction within the meaning of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a convicted murderer, filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 3.850, which was denied by the trial court. When the denial was affirmed on appeal, petitioner retained new counsel and filed an original petition for habeas corpus with the court, in which he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Pursuant to instructions from the court, petitioner filed a second Fla. R. Civ. P. 3.850 motion with the trial court. The trial court denied the motion as being untimely. On appeal, the court held that because petitioner filed his second motion within the time provided by the court, it was not untimely. However, because the trial court did not rule on the merits of petitioner's claims, the court was unable to review them. The court held that because the jury was instructed on premeditation and felony murder, and because there was sufficient evidence to convict petitioner on premeditation, petitioner's counsel was not ineffective for not arguing that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of felony murder. Therefore, the court denied the petition for habeas corpus but remanded the case for reconsideration of petitioner's motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order finding that petitioner's second motion for postconviction relief was untimely and remanded it for reconsideration of the merits, because the court had granted petitioner the right to file the second motion, but the petition for habeas corpus was denied, because petitioner's counsel was not ineffective for not raising a nonmeritorious issue on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of numerous crimes, including murder and was sentenced to death. Following post-conviction proceedings, the death sentence was vacated, and a second sentencing hearing was conducted. At resentencing, defendant moved to disqualify the judge under Fla.

The trial court conducted a hearing, allowing the state to present evidence, and denied the motion at the conclusion of the hearing. Defendant was, again, sentenced to death. The court reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing, instructing that a new judge be appointed. The court found that by conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court failed to follow the procedural process outlined in Fla. R. Jud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case was brought before the court on cross-appeals regarding a decision which reversed defendant's conviction for attempted murder in the third degree of a law enforcement officer, because the Florida statutes under which defendant was convicted were unconstitutional in that attempted third degree murder was punished more severely than the completed offense. The court affirmed the decision based upon the rules of statutory construction, not reaching the constitutional issue. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch.  784.07(3) and Fla. Stat. ch. 775.0825, which applied to attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, applied only to first-degree murder. If it applied to defendant's attempted murder in the third degree, the result would be that the attempt carried a greater penalty than the completed offense, with the result that a criminal who attempted the murder of a law enforcement officer would have substantial incentive to complete the offense so as to avoid the harsher penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court held the statute to be vague and subject to arbitrary application, and therefore invalid. The statute made it a third-degree felony for an employee to accept a benefit in return for violating a &quot;common law duty.&quot; The court pointed out that few workers would be aware that they owe such a &quot;common law duty&quot; to their employers and fewer still could define the dimensions of that duty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for first degree murder and the imposition of the death penalty. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred by denying his motions for acquittal on both first degree murder and felony murder because insufficient evidence existed to convict on either charge. The court agreed that the trial court erred in denying the motion for a judgment of acquittal on first degree murder. The court did not reverse defendant's conviction because the trial court correctly denied the motion for acquittal on felony murder. The court held that although the trial court failed to instruct the jury on both charges, the error was harmless. The court reasoned that because the evidence supported a conviction for felony murder, the jury could convict defendant of first-degree murder. The court held no fundamental error occurred when a defense witness testified that inmates who served life sentences could be released. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to give the instruction that defendant's age could be considered for mitigation. All of defendant's other issues were meritless. Thus, the conviction and penalty were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus that required expunction of the allegedly unconstitutional proviso from the state's records. Respondent legislature filed a counter-petition for a writ of mandamus that required the secretary of state to expunge petitioner's veto. The supreme court found that the proviso was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12 and also found that petitioner's veto violated the same constitutional provision. The court held that the legislature could not enact or amend a law on a subject other than appropriations in an appropriation act simply because the legislature expressed an intent to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed burglary, attempted sexual battery, and armed robbery and was sentenced to death in the Circuit Court in and for Bay County (Florida). Appellant sought review, asserting that his motion to disqualify the trial judge was improperly denied and that a mistrial should have been granted after the prosecutor made comments that shifted the burden of proof to appellant and referred to his silence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant confessed to stabbing a woman, he was convicted of murder and other offenses and was sentenced to death. Appellant obtained a new trial with a new judge and claimed that the judge's conduct indicated he was biased against appellant. Appellant was again convicted and sentenced to death. He sought review, arguing that a motion to disqualify the trial judge should have been granted and that a mistrial should have been declared after comments by the prosecutor shifted the burden of proof to appellant and referred to his silence. On review, the supreme court found that the motion to disqualify was not legally sufficient in that appellant did not have a well-grounded fear that he would not receive a fair trial from the presiding judge. As to the prosecutor's comments, the supreme court found that the remarks did not have the effect of instructing the jury that appellant bore the burden of presenting evidence in his defense. The supreme court found that competent, substantial evidence supported the verdict. Other arguments were rejected where any error was found to be harmless, and the convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions for murder, armed burglary, attempted sexual battery, and armed robbery were affirmed. The motion to disqualify a judge was not sufficient, appellant did not have a well-grounded fear that he would not receive a fair trial, and prosecutor's comments did not impact appellant's burden of proof or right to a fair trial. The court also affirmed the sentences, including a death sentence, holding that any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner biological father sought review of a decision of the District Court of Appeal (Florida), that determined that petitioner abandoned a baby based on a consideration of petitioner's conduct toward the baby's mother during her pregnancy in an adoption proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner biological father impregnated the birth mother. During the pregnancy petitioner offered the birth mother little financial and emotional support. The birth mother moved out of petitioner's home after he physically abused her and informed petitioner that she was considering adoption. Petitioner told her to do whatever she had to do. After being notified that the baby was being put up for adoption, petitioner finally sought legal aid. The summation of various lower court proceedings ultimately was a determination that petitioner abandoned the baby. Petitioner asserted that consideration of how he treated the birth mother was improperly weighted. The court affirmed the determination, holding that evidence of a parent's prebirth conduct was relevant to whether that parent had abandoned the child and that the evidence indicated that petitioner showed little to no interest in the birth mother or the unborn child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the abandonment determination. The court held that the evidence indicated that petitioner biological father showed little to no interest in the birth mother or the unborn child. Evidence of a parent's prebirth conduct was relevant to whether a parent has abandoned a child.</SPAN></P>
