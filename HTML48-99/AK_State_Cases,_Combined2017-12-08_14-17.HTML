</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's trial did not begin until 14 months after the original complaint, arrest, and arraignment were filed. For 10 of those months, defendant's case remained completely dormant. The court found that defendant's failure to demand a speedy trial did not constitute a waiver and that the burden was on the State to give a speedy trial. The court determined that it was irrelevant whether the State or the congested trial calendar caused the delay because defendant had been substantially prejudiced either way. Reversing, the court held that the delay in bringing defendant to trial was excessive and violated her constitutional rights. The court gave retroactive effect to a prior decision that held a less than 14 month delay excessive because the purpose of the holding was primarily related to the integrity of the fact-finding process and application of the holding was not outweighed by a negative effect on the administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, wholesale liquor distributors, challenged an order of a superior court (Alaska), which granted summary judgment to appellee, the Commissioner of Economic Development, on the distributors' petition for judicial review of the commissioner's order granting a tax incentive to a brewery pursuant to the Alaska Industrial Incentive Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.26.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner granted an exemption from excise taxes to a brewery pursuant to &sect; 43.26.010. Judicial review was sought by the distributor, which resulted in a grant of summary judgment to the commissioner. The distributor contended that the exemption was unconstitutional and that the commissioner did not make proper findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court exercised judicial review and affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment to the commissioner. The distributor had standing to challenge the commissioner's decision based on its competitive effect on his economic interest. That was so despite the legislative limits set on judicial review of the commissioner's actions. The scope of review was nevertheless restricted to ensuring compliance with the constitution, including fundamental procedural fairness, and guarding against arbitrary action. Based on the evidence, the commissioner properly found that the brewery was an eligible business for an exemption from excise taxes. Furthermore, the classification of businesses violated neither the Equal Protection nor the Commerce Clauses because it proceeded on a rational basis and advanced economic development.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from a trial court (Alaska), which convicted him of felony escape in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.30.090 (Michie).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was incarcerated after his felony conviction. After he failed to appear for dinner, defendant was discovered in another town. Defendant contended that he lost consciousness and did not remember escaping. Defendant forfeited 168 days of good time and was convicted of escape. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Under &sect; 11.30.090, only a general intent was required for the crime of escape. Even though an injury could only have amounted to a crime when it was inflicted by an intention, the intention meant only that an accused's act was required to be more than simply inadvertent or neglectful. The jury instruction was sufficient if it required that defendant acted intentionally and with an awareness of his conduct. Defendant was not subject to double jeopardy by the combination of the administrative forfeiture of 168 days of good time and his subsequent criminal prosecution for escape when no greater sentence was imposed upon defendant by virtue of the disciplinary action. Section 11.30.090 did not deny defendant equal protection of the law when escape was classified as a felony or a misdemeanor on the basis on the crime for which the escapee was initially confined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fired shots at the victim as he was driving away. One shot struck the car at a point beside the right front door. A second and third shot were fired, and one struck a portion of a fence in line with the car. After defendant testified, the State was allowed to introduce, over objection, evidence of defendant's convictions for burglary and counterfeiting that occurred more than 30 years before as well as an armed robbery conviction that occurred approximately 15 years before. The court found that the trial court committed error by allowing evidence of these prior convictions. Evidence of the most recent conviction was not admissible because defendant had been denied assistance of counsel on appeal of that conviction. The court found that the introduction of a conviction for armed robbery would have had a substantial effect upon the jury's deliberations because his credibility was absolutely crucial; therefore, the error in admitting the evidence was not harmless. The court also found that it was an abuse of discretion to permit the introduction of a 37-year old conviction and a 35-year old conviction for the purposes of impeaching defendant's credibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a theater operator, sought review of the denial of a motion to suppress evidence and a motion to dismiss an indictment for contributing to the delinquency of a minor in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.40.130(a) in an adversary hearing in Alaska.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the denial of a motion to suppress evidence and a subsequent denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for contributing to a minor's delinquency. The court concluded that defendant presented a sufficiently important First Amendment-based question to warrant immediate review and because the state's prosecution impinged upon First Amendment rights under a statute alleged to be clearly inapplicable, serious constitutional issues appeared. The court found that the search warrant executed solely on the basis of the officer's affidavit asserting a portion of the films were viewed and that such films were obscene failed to constitute the required inquiry of whether the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appealed to prurient interests. The court found that the officer's conclusions were an insufficient basis for a warrant issuance and defendant was entitled to have the evidence suppressed. The court further found that the indictment had to be dismissed because the application of the delinquency statute to defendant's film exhibition was unconstitutional when the language of proscribed was too imprecise and vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's petition for immediate review of orders which denied both a motion to suppress evidence and a motion to dismiss the state's indictment for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The court reversed the orders and granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence and the motion to dismiss the indictment for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot a man after he quelled the voices in his head by agreeing to kill. Defendant was arrested at the scene, and a gun was recovered from defendant's car. After a continuance, a new judge assumed the bench, and defendant was tried and convicted by a jury. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, while defendant was denied his five days under Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.20.022(a)(c) to peremptorily challenge the new judge, he failed to show any harm. The court further held that the discovery of defendant's gun was valid on-the-scene questioning for which Miranda was unnecessary. Defendant was not objectively in custody, and the police had a valid reason to stop and frisk defendant for weapons. The court concluded that the record was inadequate because of defendant's lack of objection in order to determine whether or not the jury had been adequately instructed on the burden of proof as to the insanity defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested, tried, and convicted of robbery. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the victim's account of the details of the robbery, his identification of defendant as one of the robbers, and defendant's own had the tendency to induce a reasonable belief that the accomplice's story was true.The court found that there was nothing in the record suggesting that the police indulged in coercion that was offensive to due process in obtaining the statements from defendant's accomplice. The court found that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination was not involved and that the accomplice's testimony at defendant's trial was not inadmissible because of such constitutional right.

The public utility sought to enjoin the commission from enforcing a rate lower than that sought by the public utility to furnish electricity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public utility sought to increase its rates but was opposed by the state public service commission. The public utility sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the commission from enforcing its rate. The lower court denied injunctive relief, and the public utility sought review. On review, the court held that the lower court erred. The court concluded that the lower court denied injunctive relief because it did not believe that the public utility would be successful on the merits of its claim. The court, however, adopted a balance of hardships approach and determined that the economic harm that the public utility would suffer if the injunction were not granted would be greater than any harm the commission would suffer if the injunction were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the lower court erred in denying the preliminary injunction sought by the public utility. The court remanded the matter to the lower court, with instructions to remand to the public service commission to set an interim rate and to establish a trust fund for deposit of the difference between the interim rate and the permanent rate. The court also ordered the public utility to pursue its claim with diligence and good faith.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction in the trial court (Alaska) of the crime of larceny in a building following a joint trial with his co-defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the admission of his co-defendant's extrajudicial statements implicating defendant in the commission of the charged crime required reversal of defendant's conviction. The court held that the admission of the co-defendant's inculpatory extrajudicial statements did not require reversal. The court observed that as the co-defendant testified, defendant was afforded the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the very person whose extrajudicial statements inculpated him. In such circumstances, defendant's right of cross-examination secured by both the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 11 was satisfied. As a result, even assuming that the co-defendant's extrajudicial statements related by the prosecution's witnesses were inadmissible hearsay, the trial judge's limiting instructions protected defendant's right to a fair trial and the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. As Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.20.150 embodied a rational basis for distinguishing acts which would otherwise be encompassed within the state's general larceny statute, the statute did not offend due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 1969 amendment to Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.20.050 provided that jury arrays would come not only from a voting list, but also from a list of purchasers of resident hunting and fishing licenses and those who had filed state income tax returns. When defendants, who were to be tried in 1969, were informed that the jury would be selected only from a voting list, and not in accordance with the amended statute, they asserted that their due process rights were being violated. The court disagreed. The court held that although voter lists did not include the names of all residents of the community eligible for jury service, that did not mean that the voting list method of selecting jurors was unconstitutional. Additionally, according to the statute, a new list of prospective jurors, which included the purchasers of licenses and income tax filers, was not to be prepared until April 30, 1971. Thus, defendants did not have the right to a jury selected under the amended statute before August 30, 1971. As a separate matter, the court declined to review the order denying defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment because it was a non-final order.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that &sect; 28.35.026 failed to provide for proof of criminal intent before conviction. The trial court denied the motion and found that the statute did require an element of intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rented an automobile from a rental company pursuant to a signed agreement and failed to return the automobile at the time stated in the agreement. Defendant argued that failure to return a rented automobile under &sect; 28.35.026 was a felony and required proof of criminal intent for conviction. He claimed that the statute had no criminal intent requirement and was, therefore, invalid. The court found that under the statute, a person was guilty of a crime if he &quot;willfully&quot; neglected to return a motor vehicle to an owner. The court noted that the statute presented three definitions of willful neglect. Only one of those definitions, &quot;with a conscious purpose to injure,&quot; incorporated an element criminal intent. Under the remaining definitions, a person could be guilty of a felony even though he may have acted unwittingly or inadvertently or negligently. To that extent, the statute was invalid. Because the jury in this case did not specify the ground for its decision, defendant's conviction could not stand. In addition, the court held that defendant's right to be present at a presentence conference was a substantial one and that the denial of that right was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for failure to return a rented motor vehicle and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of two counts of possession of marijuana and one count of illegal sale of marijuana to a minor. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The search was unreasonable and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. Searches incident to an arrest could extend only to the persons of the suspect in order to remove any weapons that the suspect had and in order to prevent the concealment or destruction of any evidence on the suspect's person. The search could then extend only to the area in to which the suspect could reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the initial application for post-conviction relief, defendant maintained the officer who signed the criminal complaint against him leading to his conviction for robbery had lacked probable cause to believe he had participated in the robbery. The court found that there was abundant evidence adduced at hearings to support a finding of probable cause for defendant's arrest and therefore concluded that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving all of the facts necessary to overturn the prior judgment of conviction. The court also determined the trial court properly disposed of defendant's amended application for post-conviction relief that was the subject of the second order. Defendant sought relief from his conviction on the ground of systematic, unlawful exclusion of certain classes of persons from the jury at his trial. Although this precise ground had not been previously advanced by defendant at trial or at any post-conviction proceeding under Alaska R. Crim. P. 35(b), the court concluded the trial court had properly disposed of the application without an evidentiary hearing because defendant failed to offer a sufficient excuse for not raising the issue earlier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the Pickering case required balancing the interests of a teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern, with the interest of the state, as an employer, in promoting efficiency in the schools. Factors relevant to this inquiry were whether the teacher's statements were directed toward any person with whom he would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work and whether there was a question of maintaining discipline by an immediate superior. Additional factors were whether the subject was a matter of public concern, and whether falsely stated matters were consistent with good faith error and were matters that could be easily corrected. The court applied these factors and ordered the reinstatement of its prior judgment. The court found that the teachers' actions were directed towards someone with whom they had daily contact and that there was a question of maintaining discipline. The court held that this was not a matter of public concern voted on by the public, such as school expenditures, and that the teachers' false statements were not consistent with good faith but were made in reckless disregard of the truth.</SPAN></P>

The provision that the parole board not consider parole for five years should have been stricken as an impermissible increase of a sentence after the original sentencing.

The court dismissed the prisoner's appeal, opining that he had not demonstrated that his purported illegal detention in any way tainted the subsequent indictment which was returned against him or in any manner infected or influenced the outcome of the trial which was held following the return of the second indictment. The court explained that pursuant to Alaska R. Crim. P. 12(b)(5) the lower court had the authority to order the prisoner held in custody pending the filing of a new indictment or information. The court stated that, according to Alaska Stat. &sect;12.75.020, a person properly imprisoned or restrained by virtue of the legal judgment of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction, did not have the authority to seek his freedom pursuant to a habeas corpus writ. The court concluded that because the prisoner's detention did not contaminate the trial that led to his legal incarceration, he was not entitled to habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

The legislators appealed but the court affirmed the superior court. The court explained that the purpose of the prohibition on dual employment was, in part, to obviate the temptation of a lawmaker to promulgate legislation increasing his second salary or to trade his vote for action otherwise promoting his second career. The court referred to many constitutional articles and state statutes using the phrase &quot;position of profit&quot; to conclude that the Alaska constitution prohibited state lawmakers from holding any other salaried, permanent, federal or state employment. Superintendents of state schools and state school teachers were &quot;employed,&quot; the court held, in positions of profit subject to the prohibition of Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 5.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teachers obtained a grant of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court, which noted that supervening changes in state law were potentially relevant to the case and may have required a remand. At issue was the action of appellee school board (board), which refused to renew the teachers' contracts to teach in public schools on the ground that the teachers had engaged in immoral conduct under 1957 Alaska Sess. Laws ch. 71, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously upheld the board's refusal to renew the teachers' contracts. The teachers had made statements about education officials. The teachers cited their constitutional political expression rights. After the court's first opinion, two things occurred. Alaska Stat. &sect; 14.20.095 was enacted. The statute provided that the teachers' rights to criticize education officials, outside school hours, could not be infringed upon. The other thing was an amendment to Alaska Stat. &sect; 14.20.090, which listed the possible causes for revocation and which retained &quot;immorality&quot; as one cause, defining it as an act of moral turpitude. The court, however, affirmed the board's conclusions that the teachers had not complied with a board regulation; that the teachers were guilty of immorality under &sect; 14.20.090 as it formerly read; and that one teacher was guilty of immorality, as then defined, for soliciting other teachers to oust the superintendent. However, the conclusion, that the other teacher's speech to a union constituted immorality, was set aside as unsupported by substantial evidence. The court noted that &sect; 14.20.090 was not involved in the case and that it had no retrospective effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder by a grand jury made up of persons residing within a 15 mile radius of the City of Anchorage. The jury had this composition because of a policy adopted by the presiding judges of the superior court that grand juries be selected only from this geographical location. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was denied, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the presiding judge had a reasonable basis for concluding that a large expense would be involved in summoning jurors from outside of the Anchorage area. There was no a denial of equal protection because the persons in the selected area represented a fair cross-section of the different economic, social, religious, racial, political and geographical groups in the Third District. A grand jury selected from this area was a jury satisfying proper standards of jury selection. Although one of the grand jurors was not selected according to law, so she was not legally qualified to serve, the indictment was valid and not subject to dismissal. A majority of the total number of grand jurors, after deducting the one not qualified, concurred in finding the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the dismissal motion and determined that the attorney's disbarment was appropriate for over reaching with regard to a client transaction although the board had dismissed the complaint against the attorney. The court observed that because the board did not reach a unanimous decision to begin with, it was incumbent upon the court to exercise its independent judgment in the matter. The court granted the attorney's petition for rehearing on the decision to disbar, but rejected the attorney's arguments that the court lacked jurisdiction because only the bar association had jurisdiction to prosecute him for misconduct and that the prior board decision was final, explaining that it possessed the inherent power to suspend or disbar attorneys and that such power could not be defeated by any contrary legislation. The court found that the attorney was entitled to a suspension instead of disbarment based on evidence of willingness to make restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed ad valorem and sales taxes against property leased to the taxpayer's radio station, as well as the residences of the associate or lay pastor. The taxpayer brought suit against the city for the recovery of taxes paid under protest. The city counterclaimed for sales taxes on all radio time sold by the taxpayer. The trial court held in favor of the city. On appeal, the taxpayer contended that the city could not lawfully assess the taxes where the radio station was operated under the taxpayer's missionary function. The court held that: (1) the property of the radio station was subject to the city's ad valorem tax because it was not used exclusively for religious purposes and it did not matter that only apart of the radio's time was sold and used for commercial purposes and that the profits derived from the sale of radio time were used to further the taxpayer's missionary work; (2) where the sales tax did not impose any unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce, it could be validly assessed; and (3) however, under Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 4, and Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.10.336(c), the parsonage of the assistant lay pastor was exempt from ad valorem tax.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that the trial court erred by ruling that collateral estoppel barred the State from relitigating the Act's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors lived in Washington and did work in Alaska on federal land under a federal contract. They paid the fees as required by the Act under protest. They then filed an action for a refund. Meanwhile, the State filed an action against them in Washington to collect taxes for a subsequent year. The Washington superior court held that the Act was invalid. The contractors argued that because the parties and the subject matter were the same in their action for a refund, only the taxation year being different, the State was precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating the Act's constitutionality. On appeal, the court noted that since the State appealed from the trial court's grant of summary judgment in the contractors' action, the Washington Supreme Court reversed the superior court's decision, ruling that the Act imposed a permissible income tax measure but that the Act's regulatory provisions were severable. The court determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied to questions involving taxation as well as to questions of pure law. The court held, however, that the Washington Supreme Court's intervening decision could not be ignored.</SPAN></P>

Alaska law did not require all sentences to be proportional to the crime committed. Instead, it only prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.

The court sustained the superior court's order. In light of the clear wording of Alaska Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 17 and 18, the court believed that the framers of the constitution and the people who adopted it intended the effectiveness of the Act passed by the legislature should not be suspended during the period between its effective date and its rejection by the referendum. The court held that if they had intended otherwise they would have expressly so provided. The natural import of Alaska Const. art. II and XI was that the filing of a referendum petition did not suspend the effect or operation of the Act. Therefore, if the Act was rejected by the people in a referendum election, it remained in effect until 30 days after certification by the secretary of state. The court remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought suit seeking to have the legislature's creation of the association declared unconstitutional. The suit was a friendly contest to determine the constitutionality of the association prior to offering bonds to the investing public.

On appeal, the court held that the evidence was wholly inadequate to afford the court a basis for resolving the questions raised by the taxpayer's specifications of error. By way of example, the court stated that one of the major issues raised was whether the purposes for which the association was formed were public purposes. In order to determine the issue intelligently a court would need to know more about the secondary market for home mortgages in Alaska than was contained in the association's affidavit. The court held that: (1) the finding of the legislature that the association would serve a public purpose did not foreclose the court from making inquiry; and (2) in the absence of a full and adequate record, a constitutional issue should not have been disposed of by summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The magistrate found that the posters constituted a safety hazard to telephone linemen required to climb the poles. The city, as a municipal corporation, had the power to commence the action. Not mentioned in the briefs of either party was the fact that at the time the action arose, the city was a home rule city and therefore clothed with considerably broader powers than the usual municipal corporation in the state. The evidence supported the magistrate's findings that the candidate committed a trespass and that the city was entitled to reimbursement for the cost of restoring the property to its original state. The city was entitled to the relief granted regardless of the theory upon which its claim for relief was based.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an election for incorporation of a city, 22 persons voted in favor of incorporation and 17 against. Included were seven absentee ballots, five favoring incorporation and two opposing. Appellants filed a complaint asking the trial court to declare the election void. The issues were decided against appellants. On appeal, the court concluded that in view of the unequivocal wording of Alaska Const. art. V, &sect; 1, which required a voter to be for 30 days a resident of the election district in which he sought to vote, the portion of 1951 Alaska Sess. Laws ch. 46, &sect; 3 that permitted nonresident property owners to vote was not consistent with the constitution. However, even if all of the absentee ballots were disqualified the outcome of the election would not have been changed. The court had jurisdiction because the proceeding was a contest of a local election commenced prior to the signing of the certificate of election. The Alaska Constitution recognized the right to contest elections. The legislature's failure to date to provide for any preliminary administrative determination of local election contests before resort could be had to the courts was not of grave consequence.</SPAN></P>

Laws 112 provided that any such forfeiture was effective immediately and that no stay pending appeal could be granted. The fishermen appealed their criminal convictions, and the superior court ordered a stay as to the forfeiture of their licenses, thereby declaring the prohibition of such stays unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer requested a declaratory judgment that the act creating the corporation and appropriating funds to it were in violation of the Alaska Constitution. The trial court found in favor of appellees, and the taxpayer appealed, arguing that the appropriation of funds for the corporation and its issuance of debenture certificates constituted the transfer of public funds and the use of public credit for other than a public purpose, in violation of Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 6. The court disagreed, finding that the announced purpose of the act creating the corporation had a sound basis in fact and the dominant purpose was a public one. Likewise, the court found no merit in the taxpayer's argument that the issuance of debenture certificates by the corporation constituted the transfer of public funds for other than a public purpose. The taxpayer also argued that the act was unconstitutional because it attempted to create an independent agency in violation of Alaska Const. art. III, &sect; 22. The court held that the corporation was what the legislature said it was: an instrumentality of the state within the department of commerce, with a legal existence separate from the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of burglary and larceny of a store by a trial court (Alaska) following a jury trial, challenged its judgment after his motion for acquittal was denied. He claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict, that the taking of his clothing by the police was without probable cause and thus an unlawful search and seizure, and that it was error to refuse to publish the first verdict of the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of a hardware store and an airline office discovered that the store was broken into and the safe had been removed and pried open. A police investigation led to the discovery of defendant, whose boot print matched evidence found at the scene and whose foot was severely injured; he gave several inconsistent stories about the injury. On review, the court found that the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it justified the jury's conclusion that he had entered the store with the intent to commit larceny and that he forced open the safe, and that he did not make a motion pursuant to Alaska R. Crim. P. 37(c) for the return of his clothing and did not object to its introduction at trial, thus waiving the issue. The court affirmed and found that the trial court did not publish the first verdict in the interest of justice and of defendant, because the jury had not determined the value of the money or property stolen as required by Alaska Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 66-13-72 (1949), and Alaska Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 65-5-41 (1957), which differentiated between petit larceny and grand larceny. The court ruled that the indictment sufficiently identified the property in the larceny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Alaska, sought review of an order of a district court (Alaska) voiding Alaska Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 51-5-148 (1957), part of the Alaska Employment Security Act, on due process grounds. That section gave the State a lien for unpaid employment security contributions, not only on property of appellee employer but also upon real and personal property used with the permission of the owner in prosecuting the employer's business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer leased the owner's premises for use as a restaurant. When it failed to pay amounts owed under the Act, the State filed a lien against the owner's land for those taxes, precipitating the employer's surrender of property to the owner. The owner then sued for a declaration that the Act violated U.S. Const. amend XIV and Alaska Const. art. I &sect; 7. After the owner obtained summary judgment, the State appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. While ruling that the Act did not violate federal and state due process clauses, the court held that it could not be constitutionally applied to the owner's property. That was because the lease establishing the parties' obligations was executed prior to the date of enactment and the owner had no right to renegotiate the lease to afford the owner protection from such conduct of the employer as could result in the imposition of a lien under the Act. That being the case, the Act could not be not validly applied to the owner's property. Therefore, while holding that the Act was constitutional, the court agreed with the district court that it was not appropriately applied to the owner's property and ordered it discharged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court finding the statute unconstitutional but it sustained the district court's ruling granting summary judgment to the owner and ordering the lien released and discharged.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of the liquor establish owners, holding that the regulation was unlawful and invalid. On appeal the court reversed. The court ruled that the regulation adopted was within the scope of the authority conferred on the board. The court found that the board was given full power, authority and control in the regulation of liquor establishment's closing hours until such time as the legislature might enact laws that would provide for and supersede the powers, duties and functions thus delegated to the board.

The grand jury indicted defendant on one count of fourth-degree misconduct involving controlled substances for possessing 25 or more marijuana plants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State appealed from a decision dismissing its case against defendant for violating Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.09.015. This statute forbids a person to use the official state seal for any advertising or commercial purpose without permission from the Lieutenant Governor. Defendant appeared on QVC and marketed a gold and silver coin commemorating the anniversary of the 1897 gold rush with the state seal on one side and a trademarked design for the Gold Rush Centennial on the other side. Defendant was asked to stop selling the coin because he did not have permission to use the state seal. Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional and that his conduct was protected free speech. The court disagreed, concluding that the First Amendment did not bar the plaintiff State's prosecution of defendant for marketing commemorative coins bearing the official state seal, a commercial activity, because defendant used the state seal without permission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary. On appeal, defendant claimed that the superior court should have dismissed his indictment because the unfinished house that he burglarized did not meet the definition of a &quot;dwelling&quot; under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(b)(20) and the first-degree burglary statute was void for vagueness. The court found sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that there was a reasonable probability that the structure was a &quot;dwelling&quot; within the meaning of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(b)(20) because the building in question was intended to be a family dwelling, the exterior of the building was finished, and sheetrock was being installed. The court found the statutory definition of &quot;dwelling&quot; was definite enough to survive defendant's constitutional challenge. Similarly, the statutory definition of &quot;dwelling&quot; was not unconstitutional based on a potential for arbitrary enforcement because defendant failed to show that the statute had historically been enforced in an arbitrary manner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was subsequently convicted of misconduct involving weapons, for being a felon in possession of a concealable firearm. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. 1991 Alaska Sess. Laws 59, &sect; 5, which modified defendant's affirmative defense under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.200, was not ex post facto legislation because it was not punitive. Regulating convicted felons' access to concealable firearms had a valid regulatory purpose. Section 11.61.200 did not violate defendant's right to bear arms because Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 19 did not invalidate the state's authority to regulate convicted felons' possession of firearms.  Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.200 did not violate equal protection because it made distinctions between violent and nonviolent felons. The superior court properly denied defendant's mistake-of-law defense because three of defendant's four sources of interpretation of &sect; 11.61.200 did not qualify as official interpretations of the law and because defendant failed to allege that he relied upon the fourth source.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court held that when a reviewing court reviewed a regulation adopted pursuant to statutory authority, the court reviewed that regulation for consistency with the authorizing statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failure to register under Alaska's Sex Offender Registration Act (the Act), Alaska, Stat. &sect; 11.56.840. The court held that the requirement of sex offenders who have a high recidivism rate to register personal information with local law enforcement agencies was not an ex post facto law nor did it violate any constitutional right of defendant. The Act was not deemed punitive under the intent-effects test because it was enacted to regulate sex offenders, not to further punish them, and the requirement of registration was not so punitive as to view the Act as punishment. Defendant's expectation of privacy in regard to the information he was required to register was not reasonable when balanced with the issue of public safety to be protected by the enforcement of the Act. Because the Act was not deemed punitive, it was not viewed as an additional factor in defendant's sentence; and therefore it was not violative of defendant's procedural due process rights or right of fundamental fairness. Under the court's analysis of the Act, it withstood all constitutional challenges raised by defendant, and defendant's conviction was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Alaska, conviction on seven counts of first-degree sexual assault, seven corresponding counts of incest, and one count of reckless endangerment for having forcible sexual intercourse with his 16-year-old daughter and injecting alcohol into her arm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions of sexual assault, incest, and reckless endangerment were affirmed. The probative force of evidence defendant sought to introduce was outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice to the witness, and was properly excluded under Alaska R. Evid. 403. Defendant's prior bad acts were similar acts against another minor, which occurred within 10 years preceding the charged offense and were admissible under Alaska R. Evid. 404(b)(2). The prosecution's final argument addressed general impact on public welfare that occurred when offenses charged against defendant were committed, and was appropriate for final argument. Reasonable jurors could agree that the prosecution had met its burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt based upon evidence, so evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Conviction on some charges and dismissal of other charges was not inconsistent, because physical evidence available to support some charges was not available to support others. Societal interests protected under the incest statute were significantly different and distinct from those protected under the sexual assault statute, so there was no double jeopardy in conviction of both crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of first-degree sexual assault, incest, and reckless endangerment were affirmed. The trial judge's decisions to bar or admit evidence and to allow the prosecution's final argument were supported by Alaska's rules of evidence. The verdicts were supported by sufficient evidence and were not inconsistent, and the varied interests of the statutes under which defendant was convicted barred a claim of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The trial court subsequently denied his petition for post-conviction relief. In a memorandum decision, the appellate court affirmed. Appellant argued that the definition of sexual penetration as codified in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(b)(56)(A) was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court disagreed. Not only did ordinary people readily understand the challenged phrase, but also it had a long tradition in the criminal law. There was no equal protection problem because there was no statutory overlap between sexual abuse of a minor and the prohibition of incest. The appellate court also rejected appellant's claim that his right to a fair trial was abridged when the trial court allowed a juror to remain on the panel even though the juror allegedly expressed reservations about her ability to be fair.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged by the state with attempted murder and two counts of first-degree assault.

Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence, contending that it was unconstitutional to convict him as an adult after the jury found him guilty of only second-degree assault, that the lower court erroneously instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and scienter, and that the presumptive two-year sentence was inapplicable because he did not assault a correctional officer. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that appellant's conviction as an adult was constitutional because he did not show he was capable of rehabilitation in a juvenile facility and that it was not an abuse of discretion to reject appellant's jury instructions in favor of the lower court's instruction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state appealed the dismissal of the criminal charges against appellee juvenile by the District Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska), because it maintained that the administrative revocation of appellee's driving privileges was not the imposition of punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee juvenile was arrested for consuming alcoholic beverages. While awaiting trial, an administrative order was entered that prohibited her from obtaining a driver's license. Thereafter, she sought the dismissal of the criminal charges against her on the basis of double jeopardy. The trial court granted her motion. Appellant state sought review of that judgment, which was reversed. The court noted that it had been previously held that the administrative revocation of a license was not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy so long as the revocation was based on conduct that bore a rational relationship to the state's regulatory scheme or to its enforcement. However, the court observed that the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V was applicable to few, if any, administrative revocations of driver's licenses. In light of that inapplicability, the court concluded that an even an unconstitutional revocation of a driver's license failed to prevent a prosecution for the underlying criminal offense. Rather, the proper remedy was a constitutional challenge to the revocation itself. Thus, the court reversed the dismissal of the criminal case against appellee.</SPAN></P>

He had previously been convicted of a class A felony.

There was no such statute regarding bail on appeal of the sentence. Appellant challenged the dual standard, and the court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court held that Alaska courts had the right to make common law, including the law of release on bail, unless the legislature had spoken on the issue. Although no laws existed regarding bail for sentence appeals, the court held that Alaskan courts were unable to release a criminal defendant on bail during a sentence appeal if the same prisoner was ineligible for bail under &sect; 12.30.040(b)(2) for a merit appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, aged 17, was indicted on charges of first-degree robbery and second-degree theft. He asked the trial court to prosecute him as a juvenile instead of as an adult. The trial court refused, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(e), which allowed appellee state to have prosecuted appellant as an adult because of his crime, did not alter matters of procedure, but altered coverage of the juvenile delinquency laws. This change was within the province of the legislature. The court agreed that Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(e) was substantive rather than procedural and did not violate Alaska Const. art.

All felony defendants were entitled to have charges screened by a grand jury, and appellant had received this right.

The court reversed the decision of the trial court. It reasoned that a minor did not have a protected right to juvenile treatment. The court found that there was a reasonably close fit between the legislature's purpose and the means the legislature had employed to effect that purpose because in cases where the evidence did not disclose whether a minor could be rehabilitated under the juvenile system, it was reasonable for the legislature to make the decision turn on whether the state had previously established probable cause to believe that the minor had committed one of the serious felonies listed in &sect; 47.12.030(a).</SPAN></P>

In the trial court, defendant failed to argue that application of the sex offender registration law to him was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that: (1) Alaska R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction by the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, (Alaska) for second-degree murder. He contended that the state was improperly allowed to introduce evidence of his past violent acts to show that he was the aggressor in order to refute defendant's claim that he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, stemming from an altercation with another man. At trial, defendant claimed he acted in self-defense; however, over defendant's objections, the state countered with evidence that defendant had acted violently on past occasions, suggesting that defendant was the first aggressor. Defendant was convicted of murder, but the court reversed. It rejected defendant's contention that the rules of evidence at the time of the altercation controlled and thus barred admission of his prior acts, finding that the ex post facto clause did not give him the right to insist on application of the prior evidence rules. However, the court found that the trial court erred in allowing specific acts because in criminal cases involving claims of self-defense, only reputation and opinion evidence were allowed to prove the character of the defendant or the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that it was error to admit specific acts of acts of violence to prove defendant's character for violence and there is a substantial possibility that this wrongly admitted evidence affected the jury's verdict. As such, defendant was entitled to a new trial and the judgment of the superior court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state asked the court to dismiss appellant prisoner's appeal from a judgment of Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District (Alaska) for failure to pay the necessary filing fee pursuant Alaska Stat. &sect; 9.19.010 (statute). In his action against the state, the prisoner unsuccessfully sought post conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claiming indigency, the prisoner contended that he should have been allowed to pursue his appeal without paying any fee. The state filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute established a mandatory minimum filing fee for indigent prisoners who wished to sue the government over matters related to their treatment as a prisoner or related to a criminal charge against them. On appeal, the prisoner argued, inter alia, that the statute unconstitutionally discriminated against indigents who were prison inmates in violation of the equal protection clause of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court, however, rejected the prisoner's assertion that the statute denied indigent prisoner's their right of access to the courts because for a truly penniless prisoner, the minimum filing fee was zero. The court held that the statute passed the equal protection test because the legislature rationally decided to force a prisoner to determine whether the merit of his claim was worth the cost of its pursuit. The court concluded that the statute was constitutional and held that the appeal would be dismissed if the prisoner failed to either pay the fee or apply for a fee reduction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the prisoner was required, within 30 days, to either pay the normal filing fee or to apply to the clerk of the appellate courts for a fee reduction and to then pay the reduced fee. The court ordered that if the prisoner failed to comply, the state's motion to dismiss the prisoner's appeal would be granted.</SPAN></P>

In seeking review, defendant asserted mistake of law and ignorance of law defenses, attacked the statute's constitutionality, and claimed the sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant, a felon, took control of a gun during a domestic dispute, defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 11.61.200(a)(10), which prohibited a felon from residing in a dwelling containing a firearm, and sentenced to a 5-year composite sentence. Upon review, the court held that defendant could be convicted of violating &sect; 11.61.200(a)(10) even if defendant was ignorant of the law.After rejecting the claim that &sect; 11.61.200(a)(10) violated the right of association, the court also held that &sect; 11.61.200(a)(10) did not violate the right to bear arms guaranteed by Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 19. In so holding, the court noted that even though &sect; 19 guaranteed the right to bear arms, the government retained the authority to enact laws prohibiting the possession of weapons when there was a significant risk that those weapons would be used criminally. Furthermore, in rejecting a mistake of law claim under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.420(a), (b)(1), the court held the fact that defendant might have relied on bad legal advice from a probation officer did not provide defendant with a defense. Finally, after independently examining the record, the court upheld defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the forfeiture of his vehicle constituted a prohibited &quot;excessive fine&quot; within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend.

Defendant also contended that forfeiture of an $ 8,000 vehicle violated Alaska law because, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.035(b), the maximum fine for a class A misdemeanor was $ 5,000. The ultimate question in assessing the Eighth Amendment claim was whether the forfeiture was grossly disproportionate to his crime. The court affirmed and held that defendant presented no facts or cases suggesting that forfeiture of a vehicle worth $ 8,000 was grossly disproportionate to his offense of repeat drunk driving. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 12.55.035 limited forfeitures because there was nothing in the statutory language to indicate as much, and defendant cited no legislative history or case authority to support his contention that the legislature used the word &quot;fine&quot; to mean both &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;forfeiture.&quot; Therefore, the court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 12.55.035(b) set a $ 5,000 limit on vehicle forfeitures imposed as a penalty for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska) convicted defendant, upon a jury trial, of two counts of receiving a bribe, one count of misconduct involving a controlled substance in the sixth degree, and three counts of solicitation to engage in the crime of delivering controlled substance, all in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 11.56.110(a)(2), 11.71.060, 11.31.110(a), and 11.71.040(a)(2).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an assistant public defender, was appointed to represent an accused, who was charged with several marijuana offenses and one possession of cocaine offense. The accused testified he gave defendant small amounts of marijuana, which defendant referred to as &quot;fuel for the case.&quot; He further testified that he took her out for expensive dinners, bought her champagne, and provided her with other meals. The accused testified that defendant scared him into giving her whatever she wanted, because he was willing to give her what she wanted to get justice. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence in the accused's case, which was denied by the trial court. Ultimately, the accused pleaded no contest to one felony count of possession of marijuana. The court held that Alaska &sect; 11.56.110(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The court concluded that defendant's conduct, as charged, fell within the &quot;core conduct&quot; prohibited by the statute. The court also ruled that the crime of receiving a bribe under &sect; 11.56.110(a)(2) did not require the State to prove that defendant acted corruptly.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants, all convicted of the crime of stalking under Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 11.41.260, .270, challenged the constitutionality of the statutes. After clarifying that the defendants' argument was more properly considered an overbreadth claim rather than a vagueness claim, the court reviewed the definitions under the stalking statute, concluded that the crime of stalking required proof that a defendant knowingly engaged in repeated acts of nonconsensual contact, and did not prohibit constitutionally protected speech. Thus, the court affirmed the convictions of the two defendants whose appeals were solely based on a challenge to the statute's constitutionality. As to the third defendant, the court also affirmed his conviction, holding that evidence of &quot;other bad acts&quot; was properly admitted under Alaska R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with two counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor. The State sought discovery under amended Criminal Rule 16. Respondent moved for a protective order, arguing that portions of the amended rule violated the privilege against self-incrimination in Alaska Constitution, Article 1, &sect; 9, as interpreted by the Alaska Supreme Court. The order was granted. The State argued that the judge erred in finding a prior decision controlling on the constitutionality of the portions of amended Rule 16(c) that required defense disclosure of witness information. The State claimed that the holding was subject to reexamination in light of intervening decisions interpreting the Federal Constitution. The court held that the precedents, decided under the Federal Constitution, had no direct effect on the Alaska Supreme Court's interpretation of Alaska's constitution and joined the Superior Court in finding unconstitutional the form of Criminal Rule 16(c) enacted in chapter 95 of the 1996 Session Laws. In accordance with &sect; 2 of chapter 95, the entire amended rule was declared invalid, and the pre-existing version remained in effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order from the Superior Court, First Judicial District, Juneau (Alaska), that denied his application for post-conviction relief. The superior court upheld a provision in appellant's judgment of conviction of one count of sexual assault in the first degree. Under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.015(a)(10), the superior court required appellant to participate in and complete a sex offender treatment program that was offered in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court decided that the wording of the order requiring appellant to complete a program of treatment did not conflict with &sect; 12.55.015(a)(10). The court decided that the wording was synonymous with the language in &sect; 12.55.015(a)(10) that authorized the superior court to require appellant to &quot;comply with&quot; his treatment plan. The court considered groundless appellant's complaint that &sect; 12.55.015(a)(10) was unconstitutionally vague. The court ruled that the words &quot;participate in or comply with&quot; in &sect; 12.55.015(a)(10) plainly empowered the superior court to order appellant's participation, compliance, or both. The court decided that appellant could not have plausibly claimed confusion as to whether he had a choice between participation or compliance because the judgment required both. The court determined that the statutory language was readily comprehensible and reasonably fixed the scope of both participation and compliance. The court concluded that the condition of probation was legal that required appellant, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.100(a)(5), to reside in a Community Residential Center approved by the Alaska Department of Corrections for a period of time not to exceed one year.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the disorderly conduct conviction. Defendant's overbreadth and vagueness challenges to the disorderly conduct statute failed because the court previously upheld it against overbreadth and vagueness challenges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged an order of the District Court, First Judicial District, Ketchikan (Alaska), which dismissed the charge against defendant for fishing with an undersized gillnet in violation of 5 AAC 27.131(f). The trial court found that the regulation defining the &quot;stretched measure&quot; method of determining net mesh size, 5 AAC 39.975(11), violated defendant's right to due process because it was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was fishing commercially for herring in an area where gillnets with a mesh size of less than two and one-fourth inches were prohibited. He was cited for violating 5 AAC 27.131(f). He moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that the regulations governing measurement of minimum net mesh size were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court dismissed the case. The court held that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the definition of the &quot;stretched measure&quot; method of determining net mesh size in 5 AAC 39.975(11) (Alaska) failed to make an accurate form of measurement reasonably available to him or that he made reasonable efforts to act lawfully. Defendant was charged with a violation under a strict liability statute, which subjected him only to non-criminal sanctions and applied regardless of his culpable mental state. Therefore, the need to provide him a precise means of predicting the lawfulness of his conduct was significantly diminished. Even if the State had a constitutional duty to provide defendant a precise means to determine in advance the lawfulness of his net's mesh size, the definition of &quot;stretched measure&quot; was not deficient.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that if defendant honestly believed, even mistakenly, that there was no legal impediment to her taking her daughter and hiding her from the authorities, then defendant did not act with the culpable mental state required for the crime of custodial interference. The court held that defendant's subjective understanding of the legal effect of the superior court's custody orders was directly relevant to the proof of this element and that defendant's conversations with her attorney were directly relevant to the task of ascertaining defendant's subjective understanding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the various cases before the trial court, the defendants' faced prosecution by either the State of Alaska or the Municipality of Anchorage. All the defendants' argued that because they had already lost their driver's licenses for the same conduct that formed the basis of the criminal prosecutions they had already been punished once and could not be punished again. The court found that the criminal prosecutions did not violate double jeopardy because the license revocations served a remedial not a punitive goal. The court rejected the defendants' argument that the license revocation was a punitive measure for the purposes of double jeopardy merely because it did not compensate the government for a loss. Instead the court looked to the purpose of revocation and found that the chief goal of revocation of a driver's license was to protect the public from dangerous drivers and was not meant as a punishment for a driver's criminal offenses and traffic violation's. As such, revocation was remedial in nature. The court also found that the mere fact that revocation served to deter misconduct, a goal of punishment, did not defeat the primarily remedial character of revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a decision by the District Court, Third Judicial District (Alaska) that granted defendants' motion to dismiss and entered an order to dismiss the charges against them on grounds that the state regulations were preempted by the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), 16 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1361-1421(h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state regulation prohibited entrance onto an island of walrus' without a permit, and further prohibited the discharge of firearms while present. Defendants were charged with entering the sanctuary without a permit and with discharging a firearm on the island. However, the MMPA exempted certain persons from the moratorium on the taking and importation of marine mammals and provided that no state might attempt to enforce any law relating to the taking of any species of marine mammal within the state. The State contended that the MMPA's prohibition did not preclude the State from enforcing its regulation because it was not a hunting regulation, but a land use regulation. The court ruled that the state regulation was preempted. The court held that the use of the phrase &quot;relating to&quot; in an express preemption clause connoted an intent to preempt state law on a broad scale. The court reasoned that both the specific prohibition against discharging a weapon on the island, under which defendants were charged, and the general requirement upon which an entry permit was conditioned, were clearly related to the taking of walrus, which was preempted under federal law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. An abundant evidentiary basis supported a jury finding that the victim did not understand the nature and consequences of engaging in an act of sexual intercourse. Ample evidence to support a reasonable conclusion that the state met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that she was mentally incapable of meaningfully consenting to sexual intercourse. There was no lack of evidence on the issues of her mental incapacity or defendant's knowledge of that incapacity. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions for acquittal. The trial court did not err in rejecting a claim of vagueness and overbreadth. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's rejection of defendant's proposed instruction on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The record supported the conclusion that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in rejecting either proposed mitigating factor.

The court held that, under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (Act), Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.30, parents were not exempt from custodial interference statutes. The court determined that the Act was intended to prohibit parents from abducting their children as a means of settling a custody dispute. The court found that the state met its burden of proving that defendant performed the act with the knowledge that he had no legal right to take the child.

The State indicted defendant for six counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree for engaging in sexual penetration with a female under 13 years of age in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.434(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge found that there was a substantial basis to defendant's defense that the victim exhibited a sexual and physical maturity, which could lead a reasonable person to believe that she was older than her actual age of just under 13 years. The trial judge rejected defendant's claim that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.445(b) was unconstitutional on its face. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial judge was required to allow defendant to present an affirmative defense that he reasonably believed that at the time he engaged in sexual penetration with the victim, she was 16 years of age or older. The court ruled that convicting defendant of sexual abuse of a minor without allowing him to present the affirmative defense of a reasonable mistake of age would violate his right to due process of law under the Alaska Constitution. Accordingly, the court did not consider the trial judge's ruling that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.445(b) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and state constitutions barred separate sentences for the murder, robbery, and assault. He claimed that he could only be sentenced for murder. When defendant raised the double jeopardy issue in the superior court, the judge agreed that robbery was a lesser-included offense of felony murder in defendant's case; that is, if he committed felony murder as alleged, he perforce committed first-degree robbery. Nevertheless, the superior court ruled that the differences in intent and conduct between robbery and felony murder were substantial enough to justify separate convictions and sentences. Defendant asserted that the superior court erred because separate convictions were never allowed when one crime was a lesser-included offense of the other. The court affirmed the cumulative sentences because Alaska law clearly supported separate convictions and punishments for the felony and the homicide.Because the legislature indicated that it wished cumulative punishment for two offenses, the Constitution allowed cumulative punishment even though the two offenses were the &quot;same.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a state trooper was driving home one evening, he noticed defendant's car, which had apparently slid into a snow berm at an intersection.

Subsequently, defendant was convicted of DWI and refusal to submit to a breath test. As a result, he received consecutive sentences, fines, and license revocations. On review, the court affirmed, with the exception of the consecutive fines and license revocations. The court held that defendant was not deprived of his right to an independent test as a result of the state trooper's refusal to administer a blood test. The court found that, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.033(e), the statutory right to an independent test was applicable after a person submitted to a breath test. Thus, the court found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one was a commercial fisherman who held a CFEC permit, which required him to be on board his fishing vessel when the mobile net gear was being used. Defendant one permitted the other defendants to use the vessel and mobile nets for fishing, while he was working for an oil company. An Alaska state trooper, who inspected the licenses and permits, charged all three defendants with fish and game violations. Defendants argued on appeal that &sect; 39.107(b), upon which their convictions were predicated, violated the equal protection clause of Art. I, &sect; 1 of the Alaska Constitution because although the State of Alaska may have had an interest in enforcing a permit system that limited the number of people who engaged in commercial fishing, so long as the number of boats taking fish did not exceed the number of permits, there was no difference whether a fishing boat was being operated by the permit-holder or by someone else. In affirming the convictions, the court held that &sect; 39.107(b) was constitutional because important governmental interests in regulating commercial fishing were advanced by requiring the permit-holder's personal presence on board the fishing vessel.</SPAN></P>

The district court also revoked defendant's license for the rest of his life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his original sentence, which consisted of a one-year prison term and a fine.

The trial court judge amended the sentence by adding a residential treatment requirement to follow the prison term. On appeal, defendant challenged the amended sentence. The court remanded the case for removal of the residential treatment portion of the sentence. The court determined that the time in the residential treatment facility was functionally equivalent to jail time. The court held that having once imposed a sentence the trial court judge could not increase the sentence by requiring additional treatment time. The record was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that defendant was a worst offender. The trial court did not have to inquire into defendant's ability to pay the fine imposed. The lifetime revocation of defendant's driver's license was legal and proportionate to defendant's offense.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.445(b), which provided an affirmative defense in regard to a reasonable belief by defendant as to the age of the victims, was constitutional even though defendant bore the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(b)(1).

The court affirmed defendant's sentence and conviction but remanded for a finding as to whether the composite sentence was necessary to protect the public, such a finding being required before the imposition of a consecutive sentence exceeding the maximum sentence of a defendant's most serious crime. Although defendant asserted he was erroneously submitted to an independent psychiatric examination under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.47.020(a), finding that neither Alaska R. Crim. P. 16(c)(4) nor (5), precluded a judge form ordering a psychiatric examination until the defendant filed a formal notice of an intent to offer the defense of insanity. The court found no indication that the prosecuting attorney asked improper questions at cross-examination, noting that under Alaska R. Evid. 404(b), evidence of past crimes was admissible if it had probative value apart from demonstrating defendant's criminal propensities and if such value outweighed its prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, and two others were indicted on charges of first-degree murder and kidnapping. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping but was the jury deadlocked as to the murder charge. He was retried and convicted of murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the denial of his post-trial motion for a new trial was proper. The trial court found that if the &quot;newly discovered evidence&quot; pointing to a different perpetrator and a police coverup had been offered to the jury it would not have produced an acquittal. The court concluded that trial court's finding was neither &quot;clearly untenable&quot; nor &quot;unreasonable.&quot; Moreover, the trial court properly recognized the potential violation of defendant's double jeopardy rights and declined to impose a sentence for kidnapping. The jury was not instructed that, for purposes of the kidnapping charge, it was required to find an act of restraint going beyond any act incidental to the murder. Therefore, the instructions left open the possibility that the verdict of guilt on the kidnapping charge was based on the jury's finding of an act of restraint that was integral to the conduct on which it based the conviction for murder.</SPAN></P>

In one call, defendant gave his phone number and motel room. The women's shelter called the police because they feared that someone at the motel room may have been being abused. When police arrived, defendant was naked and the police followed him into his room where defendant made incriminating statements. Defendant was tried and convicted of harassment pursuant to &sect; 11.61.120(a)(4). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court held that defendant was not in custody and his incriminating statements were properly admissible. The court further determined, however, that the trial court's jury instructions were faulty. The court held that the trial court's general instruction on the intentionality requirement of &sect; 11.61.120(a)(4) rendered the statute overbroad. The court concluded that the jury should have been instructed that defendant was guilty of harassment only if his phone calls had no legitimate communicative purpose and if defendant's speech was devoid of any substantive information and his sole intention was to annoy or harass the women's shelter.</SPAN></P>

The court found under the implied consent statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.035(a), the police were authorized to test an arrested motorist's blood whenever a motor vehicle accident occurred and someone other than the motorist had been injured in the accident. The court held that &sect; 28.35.035(a) did not require an arrested motorist be offered a breath test first where it could not infer a legislative intent to limit the blood testing authorized by the statute to situations in which the motorist had first refused to submit to a breath test. The court concluded when a blood sample was drawn by a physician in a medially acceptable manner in a hospital, blood extraction from an arrestee was not so great of an intrusion as to have violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court's order of dismissal contained language suggesting that the trial judge may have weighed or considered some of the evidence at trial in making its ruling. The court stated that for defendant to prevail on his motion for dismissal, the burden was on him to prove affirmatively that he did not know and could not have learned, through reasonable inquiry, the location of the boundary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a property owner who lived on his mining claim during the spring and summer. He maintained a landing strip for airplanes during the months he lived on the property. He was convicted of violating &sect; 02.20.050 after he placed barrels on the landing strip to prevent its use during the winter months. Defendant contended that the district court should have granted his motion to dismiss because he did not intend the land to be used as an airstrip during the winter, and that, therefore, his placing the barrels on the property did not actually cause an obstruction of an airport under &sect; 02.20.050. The court agreed and reversed the conviction, concluding that the motion to dismiss should have been granted. The court found that the statute was not sufficiently clear so that it could be said that defendant's conduct was criminal under &sect; 02.20.050. As worded, the statute did not specify when or how a landowner could legally obstruct his airstrip as a means of closing it to air traffic. Because the statute was ambiguous it had to be construed in favor of defendant and against the State, and, as such, it did not reach defendant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

The State's evidence at trial indicated that, after riding in a taxicab, defendant left without paying. Defendant asserted that he had fled the cab without paying because the driver had assaulted him. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court gave the jury an instruction reciting the elements of the offense of theft of services as set out in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.200(a)(1). Over defendant's objection, the trial court also included in the instruction the language of &sect; 11.46.200(b). Defendant claimed that the instruction in effect created a presumption that impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defense. The court held that because defendant presented evidence at trial to meet or rebut the presumption that he had obtained services by deception when he failed to pay the fare, the decision of whether to inform the jury of its existence was a matter for the trial court's discretion. The court held that in electing to inform the jury of the statutory presumption, the trial court was obligated, under Alaska R. Evid. 303(a)(1), to describe the presumption as a permissible inference, and it did not do so.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a statement which he made before a magistrate, in denying his motion to dismiss the case, and in allowing a witness to testify to statements which the victim made identifying him as her assailant. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting the first part of defendant's statement to the magistrate because it was unsolicited and voluntary. Admission of the second part was harmless error. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds because the first trial court's finding that the prosecutorial misconduct leading to the mistrial was inadvertent precluded a finding that the misconduct rose to a level which prevented a retrial. The victim's statement to the witness was an excited utterance. An excited utterance was a firmly rooted hearsay exception and admission of out-of-court statements under the exception did not violate the confrontation clause.</SPAN></P>

The proposed cross-examination was intended to show that the alleged victim entered a conduct agreement, an informal juvenile probation, when he first reported being sexually abused by defendant and when he testified against defendant before the grand jury. On appeal, the court reversed because it could not say that the error in precluding cross-examination on the issue of motive was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The alleged victim was the State's primary witness, corroborating evidence was minimal, and the State's case hinged on the alleged victim's credibility. The exposure of the alleged victim's motivation in testifying was an important function of defendant's constitutionally-protected right of cross-examination, and defendant's right to cross-examination outweighed the State's interest in protecting the anonymity of juvenile offenders.</SPAN></P>

The trial court stayed execution of the sentence pending the appeal of the constitutional issues defendant had preserved. Defendant appealed his conviction, raising several constitutional issues. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute was not vague and clearly prohibited the importation of alcoholic beverages for personal consumption. The court found that defendant's argument that a potential defendant would be unable to find any published law banning the importation of alcohol into the municipality was without merit because he never claimed not knowing that the law was passed and the importation was illegal. The court opined that local option laws were not an unconstitutional delegation of authority because the local municipalities were not enacting state law but only adopting the state law in their communities.

Per the court, the Alaska legislature acted constitutionally in enacting former &sect; 11.71.060(a)(3), which established 19 years as the minimum age for possession and use of marijuana and leaving the maximum age for juvenile jurisdiction unchanged so that 18-year-olds that violated former &sect; 11.71.060(a)(3) would be prosecuted as adults.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' sentences ranged from 15 days to one year in prison, and on appeal, defendants claimed that Alaska Statute 04.16.200 violated equal protection and due process, discriminated against rural communities, and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that when read in conjunction with Alaska Statute 04.11.010, Alaska Statute 04.16.200(b) defined an offense, afforded adequate notice of the proscribed conduct and the prescribed penalty, and thus satisfied due process requirements, and the fact that Alaska Statute 04.11.490 did not itself create or give notice of the felony offense and penalty did not violate constitutional due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that a grant of use and derivative use immunity to defendant had no effect on her pending appeal and did not preclude the State from reprosecuting in the event of a reversal. The court found that the issue presented was whether the Alaska Constitution permitted the State to compel potentially self-incriminatory testimony from a witness by an offer of use and derivative use immunity, or, conversely, whether a broader form of immunity, transactional immunity, was required. The court affirmed the order of the trial court and held that only a grant of transactional immunity met the requirements of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court reasoned that art. I, &sect; 9 commanded that no person shall be compelled in any criminal proceeding to be a witness against himself and that a narrow interpretation of the Alaska Constitution was not permitted, because the court found that the drafters of art. I, &sect; 9 intended the privilege against self-incrimination to have been supplanted only by a grant of transactional immunity.</SPAN></P>

The arresting officer saw defendant put a knife into a briefcase he was carrying.

Defendant attacked his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon on grounds that carrying the knife in his briefcase did not violate the statute as it was not concealed on his person, or, alternatively, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Affirming, the court held that the phrase &quot;on the person&quot; was broad enough to encompass weapons concealed either in clothing or in purses, briefcases, or other hand-carried containers. The court found that the fact that people could in good faith litigate the meaning of a statute did not necessarily mean that the statute was so indefinite as to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted sexual abuse of a minor, and, in a retrial, of sexual abuse of a minor in the first- and second-degrees and appealed. He urged that the trial court had erroneously entered a closure order under &sect; 12.45.048 in the retrial, and that insufficient evidence supported his conviction in the first trial. The court agreed in part, explaining that the trial court had granted the State's request to close the courtroom in the retrial, but the record omitted specific findings to justify the decision. For this reason, the court reversed the conviction in the retrial. The court found that there was ample evidence of attempted sexual abuse of a minor in the first-degree under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.31.100(a) to support the verdict in the first trial. The record showed that defendant had brought the victim and syrup into the bathroom, and asked the victim if she would lick the syrup from his penis. The presence of a wet drop of syrup on the counter supported the conclusion that defendant had actually opened the syrup and poured some of it. A reasonable jury could have found that these actions were a substantial step toward committing first-degree sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on parole for a robbery conviction. He violated the terms of his parole and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In the process of being arrested for his parole violation, defendant escaped. He was charged with second degree escape and the trial court dismissed the indictment. The state appealed and the court reversed. The court found that defendant remained subject to all the terms of his burglary sentence. His parole violation triggered parole revocation and an immediate reinstatement of the maximum prison term, requiring him to resume service of the burglary sentence. The trial court erred in ruling that the underlying burglary was &quot;too attenuated&quot; to support the escape charge. Rather, the burglary was the direct source of the arrest. The court held that the term &quot;official detention for a felony&quot; in the second-degree escape statute was intended to encompass detention based on parole warrants for parole violations. The statute was not void for vagueness because the language was broad enough to permit defendant to understand that the act of running away was prohibited and would subject him to further criminal liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of commercial fishing in closed waters pursuant to &sect; 09.320(a) following the prosecution of their cases as violations on a strict liability theory. The sentence imposes was a fine and a payment in lieu of forfeiture of their fishing nets. After payment of the fines, defendants filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Alaska R. Crim. P. 35.1 for modification of their sentences and under Alaska R. Crim. P. 35 for a refund of excess fines, to reduce their fines, alleging that the Legislature had limited fines for strict liability violations of fishing regulations. On appeal from an order granting the motion, the court held that: (1) the district court had jurisdiction to hear the motion as a Rule 35(a) motion because it was part of the original criminal proceeding, not as a motion for post-conviction relief; (2) as such, it was not governed by the restrictions on the civil jurisdiction of the district court set forth in Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.15.050 in that it was not an action of an equitable nature, and (3) hence, the district court had jurisdiction to hear the motion as a Rule 35(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence, and hence, to order a refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested while commercially fishing for salmon using drift net gear on a river. The criminal complaint alleged that he fixed the net to an exposed sandbar by allowing his fishing vessel to go aground and go dry, thus ceasing the net from drifting and cited 5 AAC 39.105(a)(3) as the regulation that defendant had allegedly violated. Defendant requested that the trial court include in its instruction to the jury on the elements of the offense a mens rea of intent. The trial court refused and instead instructed the jury that the mens rea for the offense was negligence. The trial court convicted defendant as charged. On his appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that by the use of the word &quot;intentionally&quot; in 5 AAC 39.105(d)(3), the Alaska Board of Fisheries established a mens rea of intent for the offense of using a drift gill net while not drifting and that intent was an essential element of the offense despite the subsequent enactment of AS 16.05.723 because the trial court's ruling that AS 16.05.723 effectively repealed the mens rea provision in the regulation contravened the presumption against repeal of prior laws by implication.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial judge erred in ordering that the courtroom be closed to the public under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.45.048, while the children gave testimony. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court concluded that defendant had been denied his right to a public trial as provided by U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that the trial judge erred in failing to hold a hearing on the issue of the particular need for closure in the case, the emotional or psychological condition of the children, or their ability to testify accurately in a public setting. Furthermore, the trial judge did not consider alternatives to closure which might have protected the welfare of the children while still allowing public access.

On appeal, the court affirmed the disorderly conduct conviction and reversed the controlled substance conviction. Given the lateness of the hour, the complaints of a citizen informant, the prior warning to defendant, and defendant's conduct when approached, the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for disorderly conduct committed in their presence. The arrest did not violate the First Amendment. Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.110(a)(1), as applied to defendant's conduct, was neither vague nor overbroad. The statute permissibly regulated the time, place, and manner of speech to avoid excessive noise. The trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the marijuana found in the dwelling's kitchen, upstairs bedroom, and garage. The officers needed only to arrest and handcuff defendant and interrogate his friend to determine that he was a proper person to care for the children present. The protective search exception to the warrant requirement did not apply, and it did not permit the extensive search undertaken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Kenai, which convicted him, following a jury trial, of sexual assault in the first degree and kidnapping in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 11.41.410 and 11.41.300(a)(1)(C), respectively. Defendant challenged the denial of his motions to change the venue, for additional peremptory challenges, and to excuse a juror for cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the sexual assault and kidnapping of a woman. The parties questioned 57 prospective jurors. The judge excused 27 jurors for cause; 10 jurors knew the victim; two knew the defendant's family; one was on duty at the hospital when the victim was examined; and one could not disregard an article that he had read in the newspaper. The article claimed that the defendant had been arrested and charged with sexual assault, that the victim had identified him, and that the defendant had prior felony convictions for sexual assault. After the defendant had exercised all of his peremptory challenges, he tried to strike a juror that knew the victim and the victim's husband. The trial judge denied that request. Defendant argued that the jury was not impartial. The court held that: (1) there was substantial doubt on whether an impartial jury had heard the case; (2) the superior court should have allowed the defendant to challenge one of the jurors for cause or to give him additional peremptory challenges; and (3) the superior court properly refused to suppress evidence of two of the victim's hairs taken from defendant's clothes after his arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that defendant drove his car across the opposing lane of traffic where he collided with a car traveling in the opposite direction. An accident reconstruction ruled out every explanation consistent with non-negligence on defendant's part. Defendant insisted that he had not been distracted by anything before the collision and denied being impaired by alcohol or drugs. His blood was tested shortly after the accident and was found to be free of alcohol. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that his indictment should have been dismissed because inadmissible evidence was presented to the grand jury. Specifically, the grand jury was informed that an autopsy of defendant's wife revealed that she had traces of cocaine and marijuana in her blood and that defendant's attorney refused to release defendant's hospital records to police. The court agreed with defendant that the disputed evidence should not have been heard by the grand jury. Nevertheless, the court affirmed because the remaining evidence supported the indictment, and the improper evidence did not appreciably affect the outcome of the grand jury's deliberations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's victims complained to their parents and to the police of numerous sex acts performed on them, including cunnilingus. Defendant was convicted of violating Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.434(a)(1) and sentenced to a total of 64 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed, but the court affirmed the conviction, vacating the sentence and remanding the case for resentencing. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.40.110 was constitutional and that it called for corroboration or credibility of hearsay testimony forming the basis of an indictment. Neither did &sect; 12.40.110 deny sex offenders equal protection in light of Alaska's adjustable uniform-balancing test. The court found that the grand jury was given sufficient evidence, including inconsistencies in the victims' statements, allowing assessment of the victims' credibility. The court also found corroboration of the victims' testimony, even if not in the way of medical evidence or an admission by defendant. The superior court properly found six aggravating factors, the court held, but in light of similar cases and the need for uniformity in sentencing, a sentence of not more than 60 years with 10 years suspended was required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to grant defendant relief and dismissed the application. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial court was correct in concluding that defendant's motion and supporting affidavits did not state a claim for relief under Rule 35(b). The court found that Rule 35(b) could not be read together with Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.165-.175 to permit the trial court to refer the case to a three-judge panel based upon a nonstatutory mitigating factor, institutional rehabilitation, arising after defendant had served a significant part of his sentence.

The trial court found that defendant had not personally inflicted the injuries on his daughter and had not acted as an accomplice. The trial court convicted defendant of two counts of second-degree assault, a lesser-included offense. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court determined that under &sect; 11.41.210, a person committed second-degree assault by recklessly causing serious physical injury to another person. Because a parent had a clear duty to aid his child, a parent's failure to carry out that duty is a legal cause of any resultant injuries and the parent could be held criminally liable. Although reasonable people could differ about the outer boundaries of a parent's duty to protect his child from harm, the duty of a parent to protect a child from severe abuse was crystal clear. Under &sect; 11.81.610, defendant knowingly engaged in the conduct causing his daughter's injuries. Defendant did not have to know that his daughter's injuries were serious, he only needed to be reckless concerning the risk that her injuries would be serious.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions for second-degree assault and terroristic threatening, holding that the terroristic threatening statute was not impermissibly vague when &quot;repeated&quot; was accorded its ordinary meaning, and there was ample evidence to permit a finding that the defendant had made &quot;repeated threats&quot; to take his wife's life. Further, there was sufficient medical testimony that the wife had suffered serious physical injury posing a substantial risk of death, therefore the second-degree assault conviction was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping, assault in the first degree, and sexual assault in the first degree. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage sentenced defendant to 12 years for the kidnapping, 7 years for the first-degree assault, and 10 years for the first-degree sexual assault. The sentences ran concurrently. Defendant appealed his conviction and the State appealed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant argued that the superior court erred in denying his request to act as co-counsel. The court held that a defendant had a constitutional right to counsel as well as the right to self-representation. However, the right to participate as co-counsel or have hybrid representation was not constitutionally protected. The trial court had broad discretion to deny hybrid representation or co-counsel status. Accordingly, the court concluded that the superior court did not err in denying co-counsel status in the instant case. The State's contention that defendant's sentence of 12 years' imprisonment was too lenient. The superior court recognized the serious nature of defendant's offense, and the sentence imposed was sufficiently substantial to reflect community condemnation. In spite of the serious nature of defendant's offense and his guarded prospects for rehabilitation given his long-term drug abuse, this was defendant's first criminal offense. Accordingly, the sentence was not clearly mistaken.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence from the telephone trap because she had no expectation of privacy in the phone messages; (2) the phone ordinance was not vague because it did not purport to hinge the lawfulness of speech or conduct on standardless, subjective reactions of unspecified third persons; (3) the ordinance was not overbroad because the ordinance was reasonably specific and provided adequate notice to allow ordinary people to know what conduct was prohibited; (4) there was little possibility that the ordinance posed any appreciable risk of chilling the legitimate exercise of free speech; (5) the ordinance did not require an actual person-to-person conversation; and (6) her sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Defendant failed to offer any explanation for how the victim's alleged promiscuity or her abuse by others could have conceivably have led a reasonable person who was unaware of her conduct to believe that she was likely to be 16 years of age or older.Because the trial judge correctly found that the proposed evidence was basically irrelevant, it was unnecessary for him to apply the balancing test as to its probative value. Under the rape shield law and the rules of evidence, the evidence was properly excluded. The trial court correctly instructed the jury on all of the essential elements of the offense. Nothing in the instructions precluded the jury from considering defendant's mental condition at the time of the alleged offense. Under the circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the proposed instructions dealing with defendant's exhaustion and intoxication.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that this statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness, and that his sentence was excessive.

The felony conviction underlying the charge had been reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of the initial felony, he was placed on a suspended imposition of sentence. One of the conditions of probation prohibited him from possessing a concealed weapon. When defendant was released pending appeal, it was under the same conditions as his pre-trial release on bail. Those conditions made no mention of weapons. Defendant testified that he understood that he could not possess firearms while on probation. He stated that he believed that when he was released pending his appeal, his conviction was not final and that he was only subject to his original bail conditions. The parole officer testified that he told defendant that he was not under his supervision while the appeal was pending. The court upheld the conviction. Defendant's claim of mistake of law amounted only to his personal belief that he was not convicted for purposes of the felon in possession statute while his case was on appeal. The reversal of the former conviction was not a defense to the felon in possession charge. The affirmative defenses in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.200(b)(1)-(b)(3) arose only when the actions described occurred before the felon in possession offense was committed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that it must find that defendant operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor as a condition prerequisite to convicting him the refusal. While a trial court might consider his admission of intoxication in mitigation of punishment, it was not a defense to a refusal to provide a chemical breath test.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a probation condition set by the District Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage. Defendant pleaded no contest to fifth-degree misconduct involving the controlled substance marijuana, a class A misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a probation condition, which prohibited him from being in a 45-block area of the Anchorage downtown area, 24 hours per day for one year. Defendant's temporary place of residence and work was within the restricted area. Reversing, the court held that even though the trial court had broad discretion to provide for probation upon the terms and conditions as the trial court considered best, it had to invalidate the probation condition imposed. The court found that there was no basis in the record, that there was a clear nexus between the area and defendant's misconduct. Furthermore, the court found that the condition imposed was unnecessarily severe and restrictive because the area encompassed a 45-block area. The court held that the restriction lacked a clear connection with the underlying offense and had a demonstrable affect on defendant's legitimate activities of working and residing. Moreover, the court held that the condition was struck because it was not reasonably related to defendant's rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then sentenced defendant to 90 days' imprisonment, with 60 days suspended on the condition that defendant not be on or near a commercial fishing boat or fishing site for a period of three years. The trial court also imposed a fine. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that defendant failed to establish that he made a reasonable mistake of law. The court noted that a superior court had rejected defendant's two prior challenges to the constitutionality of the Act and that defendant was warned by counsel of the consequences of his actions if the ruling declaring the Act unconstitutional was reversed. As to the sentence, the court vacated the fine because the trial court failed to inquire as to defendant's ability to pay.

The dispatcher provided a general description, which matched the driver. The trooper placed defendant under arrest, and gave the required Miranda warnings after which defendant made various admissions. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. The court held that the trial court properly determined that the steps taken by the trooper were reasonable, and that the officer had probable cause for arrest as soon as he learned that defendant's license was revoked and that defendant, who had given a false name, fit the general description given by the dispatcher.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the State did not call the child as a witness, relying on the testimony of the child's mother, a trooper, and a doctor as to the child's out-of-court statements. The mother's testimony qualified as an exception to the hearsay rule as an excited utterance. The trooper's testimony was not hearsay as it was admitted to establish that the child understood the term penis. Nor was it prejudicial as the jury had already heard evidence disclosing the substance of the child's statement to the trooper. Admission of the doctor's testimony was harmless as it centered entirely on the conclusion that the child understood his anatomical question. The corpus delicti rule was satisfied by the mother's corroborative testimony. Upon analyzing the reliability of the child's out-of-court statement, and, finding it to be reliable and trustworthy, the court concluded that no violation of the right to confrontation had occurred. The court rejected defendant's claims of prosecutorial misconduct. Because the record as a whole demonstrated that defendant received a fair trial, his claim of cumulative error was rejected. The trial court incorrectly concluded that concurrent sentences were mandatory.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the case dismissed pursuant to the civil compromise provisions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court's exercise of discretion to dismiss the case was expressly authorized by the legislature in &sect;&sect; 12.45.120 and 12.45.130.

The police informed him at the accident scene that his license would be suspended in 30 days if he did not comply with the financial responsibility statute by filing proof of financial responsibility.

Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in convicting him because he never received formal notice of the suspension, which by no fault of his, was mailed to his address of record but never successfully delivered to him. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that defendant had notice that his license was suspended. Despite not receiving actual notice sent from the Department of Motor Vehicles, defendant had knowledge that his license was suspended when he was expressly told by the police after the accident that it would be suspended if he did not comply with the financial responsibility statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a state trooper stopped defendant for speeding, he noticed signs of intoxication, administered a set of field sobriety tests, and asked defendant to take the preliminary breath test, but he declined. The trooper was convinced that he had probable cause to arrest for driving while intoxicated, but another speeding car came by, so the trooper just cited defendant for speeding and refusing the breath test, instructing the passenger to drive. The court agreed that requiring a suspect to submit to a breath test was a sufficient intrusion by a law enforcement officer to be regarded as a search. However, the court disagreed that the search was unreasonable, as an officer had to have probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence before he could lawfully administer a preliminary breath test, and it was reasonable for an officer to confirm or dispel his observations. The court similarly rejected the argument that the breath test violated the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that he could not be convicted of being a felon in possession of a concealable firearm while the predicate conviction was on appeal and the sentence stayed pursuant to Alaska R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for the sale of narcotics. While defendant was appealing this conviction he pawned a handgun at a gun shop.

Defendant contended that during the period of his appeal the execution of his sentence was expressly stayed by the superior court pursuant to Alaska R. App. P. 206(a). Defendant argued that he was not &quot;convicted by a court&quot; while his case was on appeal and his sentence stayed. His conviction was not final and therefore could not be a predicate for prosecution under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.200(a)(1). On appeal the court held that a person has been &quot;convicted of a felony&quot; under the statute when the appropriate trier of fact has made a determination of guilt and sentence has been imposed. A timely appeal did not suspend a conviction, even though a formal stay was entered under Alaska R. App. P. 206.

On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and argued that the convictions were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.51.120 in effect shifted to him the burden of proving the lack of a lawful excuse for failure to pay. Defendant further argued that the term &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; in &sect; 11.51.120 was impermissibly vague and that the trial court's decision to restrict the phrase to the issue of ability to pay precluded him from raising any defense other than financial inability. Defendant also argued that he should not have been convicted of multiple counts of non-support because the offense of criminal non-support was a continuing one. The court held that: (1) &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; meant that the prosecution had to establish that the accused had the ability to pay; (2) proof of failure to make court-ordered support payments sufficed to establish a prima facie case of non-support; (3) proof of a knowing failure to provide support accompanied by a reckless disregard for the ability to pay was required; (4) defendant was not required to prove the absence of a lawful excuse or to incriminate himself; and (5) the prosecution properly conceded that defendant's support obligation was a continuing one and he should have only been convicted for one count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed a man in an airport by pointing a loaded gun at him and demanding money from him. Defendant did not contest the physical aspects of the crime but relied on the affirmative defense of insanity, Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.47.010. Defendant was found guilty but mentally ill and appealed her conviction. Defendant contended that Alaska's insanity statutes,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.47.010 et seq., violated the state and federal constitutional guarantees of (1) due process, (2) equal protection, and (3) the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction. The court found that the general statutory scheme was constitutional, but defendant was prejudiced by a jury instruction. The court found that the jury instruction confused the defense of insanity with the culpable mental state required for a robbery conviction. The jury should have first considered whether the State had met its burden of proof with respect to both the actus reus and the mens rea elements of the offense. The instruction diluted the State's burden of proving culpable mental state and the other instructions did not cure the deficiency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first degree murder, Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.100(a)(1), and convicted of second degree murder, Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.110, following a jury trial in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to permit the defense to admit the hearsay statement of an unavailable witness. The witness's statement to the police was made 40 to 50 minutes after the shooting. Thus, the hearsay statement was not a present sense impression as defined by Alaska R. Evid. 803(1). Additionally, the exclusion of the statement did not substantially affect defendant's ability to present his defense. The court also reviewed the withheld anonymous &quot;Crime Stoppers&quot; tips that the police received concerning the shooting incident and determined that they were properly withheld from defendant because disclosure would have harmed enforcement or protection efforts, and the documents were not relevant to his defense. Further, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on imperfect self-defense because an &quot;unreasonable&quot; belief that force was necessary did not mitigate murder to manslaughter. Finally, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that they could not consider lesser included offenses unless they first unanimously found defendant not guilty of the greater charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate trials, defendants were convicted of violating regulations adopted by the Board, which were strict liability offenses under &sect; 39.002. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decisions. The court held that the Board was authorized to make the breach of a regulation a violation and a strict-liability offense that was punishable by a noncriminal fine. A violation was a noncriminal offense punishable only by fine, and a person charged with a violation was not entitled to a trial by jury or appointed counsel. The Board was authorized to make the breach of a regulation a crime that was punishable by imprisonment, but only if mens rea was required. Where a higher degree of mens rea was not specified in a regulation, the court inferred a negligence requirement as a predicate to a sentence of imprisonment. The Board was not authorized to adopt a regulation if a violation of the regulation subjected the violator to the statutory penalty of imprisonment in the absence of a finding of mens rea because strict liability was not necessary to carry out the purpose of the statutes authorizing the Board to adopt regulations and make their violations criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his murder conviction by the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District. He argued that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of his intoxication offered to show diminished capacity, that the indictment should have been dismissed because of errors in grand jury instructions, that there was a failure to present exculpatory evidence and use of inadmissible evidence, and that his sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was drinking with several men when an argument began. Defendant shot one of the men twice in the abdomen. The victim died in the hospital after stating that defendant shot him. Defendant confessed but claimed that he was drunk. Defendant was convicted of murder, and his appeal was denied. The trial court correctly refused defendant's offer of proof that he was intoxicated at the time he shot the victim. The court rejected defendant's attack on the constitutionality of both the limitation on the defense of intoxication in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(a)(2) and, by extension, the absolute prohibition of that defense in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.630, as well as his due process, equal protection, and cruel and unusual punishment arguments. It was not plain error to interpret Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.110(a)(1) as an offense that did not require that defendant intentionally cause a result. The decision to deny defendant the right to rely on a diminished capacity defense based on intoxication was correct. The prosecutor did not err in presenting evidence to the grand jury. It was correct to find that defendant was a worst offender, and the sentence imposed was not clearly mistaken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress the drugs seized from her house because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.

Further, defendant claimed that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.73.099, which defined &quot;imitation controlled substances,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court held that the warrant was supported by probable cause because the information on which the warrant was based, which was provided by an informant, was reasonably credible, the information was not stale, and there was a nexus between defendant's residence and the drugs. The court also held that the introduction of a hearsay laboratory report in the grand jury proceedings did not require dismissal of the indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior case, the trial court determined that the state's Limited Entry Act (act) was unconstitutional and vacated the prior convictions of defendant and his two daughters for violations of the statute. While the trial court's decision in that case was pending, a state trooper boarded defendant's boat and found additional violations of the statute. Defendant was charged with the new offenses five days later, after the state supreme court granted the state's request for a stay of the trial court's ruling in the prior case. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence imposed by the trial court and remanded the case. The court held that defendant presented a sufficient claim of a reasonable mistake of law for the trial court on remand to conduct a hearing on the issue. The court found that it was for the trial court to determine whether defendant reasonably relied on the judicial court's ruling in the prior case. The court noted that defendant also claimed that he was relying on the advice of counsel when he continued fishing, and the state apparently believed that it needed to stay the prior judicial decision in order to enforce the act.</SPAN></P>

The court also directed the trial court to consider the extent of defendant's good faith in sentencing if the reasonable reliance defense was rejected on remand.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, while there may have been a better procedure for the prosecutor to prove the elements of the instant offense to the grand jury, it was not error to prove defendant's prior convictions first. The court stated that although many of the prospective jurors had heard of defendant, no juror was shown by defendant to have been unfair or prejudiced against him. The court further commented that there was no evidence that defendant was tried in an atmosphere hostile to him. As such, it found no error in denying his motion for a change of venue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled nolo contendere and was convicted of assault and attempted murder. In accordance with an agreement with the State, he was adjudicated guilty but mentally ill and sentenced to 12 years with 5 years suspended on each count, to be served concurrently. Defendant argued that to hold someone criminally responsible who lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the law's requirements violated due process, constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and resulted in a deprivation of equal protection. He also argued that his sentences were excessive under the circumstances. The court concluded that the State of Alaska could constitutionally eliminate a separate insanity defense based on irresistible impulse or inability to conform one's conduct to the law. The determination of the point at which a person's mental condition justified exculpation was an ethical question for legislatures and juries, not courts. The court held that the trial court should not have rejected the mitigating factor submitted by defendant out of hand without giving any reasons. The court directed the trial court on remand to disclose on the record its reasons for accepting or rejecting the mitigator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, vacated the sentence imposed, and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stopped his vehicle of his own accord and he himself approached the officer who, though he had also stopped his car, had made no attempt to contact him.

After defendant failed the test, defendant refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. Defendant was charged under City of Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 9.28.022(C). Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not in custody until he was ordered to submit to field sobriety tests, which was proper because at that point, the police officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant had been drinking. The court further held that the plain meaning of City of Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 9.28.021(A) is not unconstitutionally vague and plainly informs that a driver is deemed to consent to a blood test. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to an attorney before the test's administration because the test was not a critical stage requiring counsel's presence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove a friend's car while he was extremely intoxicated. He hit two pedestrians at an intersection. A jury convicted him of manslaughter, and he pled no contest to leaving the scene of an injury accident. The trial court found that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.135 allowed separate punishment on the manslaughter counts. On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence violated the constitutional prohibition on being placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.135 was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The trial court's imposition of separate punishments for the two manslaughter counts violated Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Although defendant acted recklessly with regard to the lives of the pedestrians, the focus was upon his intent and conduct. The difference between each count was the name of the pedestrian involved. Because defendant hit both pedestrians at once, but he intended to hit neither, his intent and conduct were identical as to each count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the District Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, which convicted him of driving while intoxicated in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a)(1). On appeal, defendant contended that the phrase &quot;intoxicating liquor&quot; in the statute was so vague as to deprive him of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also contended on appeal that the phrase &quot;intoxicating liquor&quot; did not put him on notice that his drinking of two cough medicines that contained alcohol was within the statutory prohibition. He also objected to the use of two jury instructions relating to when a person was considered to be under the influence. Defendant's vehicle was stopped because it was weaving within its own lane and had crossed the divider. The officer smelled alcohol on defendant, who refused to perform sobriety tests. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The revision of the statute defining intoxicating liquor, Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.20.010, by Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.21.080(b)(1), included a definition of alcoholic beverages, which the court found to be merely a replacement for the phrase &quot;intoxicating liquor.&quot; Using the definitions of intoxicating liquor, intoxicant, drink, and beverage, the court found that the two cough medicines used by defendant included alcohol and were, therefore, intoxicating liquors within the common understanding of that phrase. In addition, a prior case provided that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a)(1), (2) gave ample notice of what substances a driver had to avoid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, following a jury trial, of attempted kidnapping. He was given the class A felony presumptive sentence of five years, pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(c)(1). On appeal, defendant argued that he should have been sentenced as a class B offender, or, alternatively that the applicable presumptive sentencing provisions were improperly enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction stemmed from an incident in which he came up behind the victim, held something to her back, and told her to get in her car. She escaped, and later identified defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's sentence. Defendant's argument that attempted kidnapping was a class B felony based upon Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.300(d) failed because the statute as it read when defendant committed the crime clearly provided that an attempted kidnapping was a class A felony, and the statute's subsequent amendments, which were made to reflect the addition of another unclassified felony, did not apply retrospectively. Further, there was no language indicating a legislative intent to create a class B felony charge for attempted kidnapping. The court further held that 1982 Alaska Sess. Laws ch. 143, which created the five-year presumptive sentence, was not unconstitutional. It did not violate the one-subject rule in Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 13, which was construed by Alaska courts with considerable breadth, and the requirement that the same bill be passed by both houses was not violated because that portion not passed by the Senate was not presented to the Governor.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant should have been permitted to prove his defense. The court held that it was a defense that a defendant acted in reasonable reliance upon a judicial decision later determined to be invalid. The court further held that whether the reliance was reasonable, was a question of fact that a defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence. The court reasoned that although it might normally be unreasonable to rely on a lower court decision, defendant's reliance was reasonable where he was a party to the prior action, he received assurance from his attorney, the officer himself was uncertain of a violation, and the State was operating under the prior ruling by obtaining a stay to enforce the statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court stated that a breathalyzer test was a reasonable search because it was incident to arrest. Furthermore, &sect; 28.35.032's criminalization of the refusal to take a breathalyzer test was not a violation of the constitutional right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and Alaska Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the District Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which denied him relief under Alaska R. Crim. P. 35(a). Defendant had sought relief from his 360-day sentence for the municipal offense of driving while intoxicated. The sentence was to be served in a state facility because Anchorage did not maintain a prison for those convicted of municipal offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentence was illegal because it rested in part on an implicit assumption that he would be eligible for parole to the same extent as a person serving the same term for a violation of the state statute punishing driving while intoxicated. He contended that pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.15.180, the Alaska State Parole Board excluded prisoners in state institutions who were convicted of municipal offenses. Defendant argued that the disparate treatment given those convicted of municipal offenses in comparison with those convicted of nearly identical state offenses deprived him of due process and equal protection of the law. The court upheld the denial of relief. First, the court held that Alaska R. Crim. P. 35(a) was not intended to provide a remedy for defendant's complaints. In particular, parole eligibility was not a proper consideration in deciding a Rule 35(a) application. Second, the court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide challenges to the parole board's interpretation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.15.180 and to the constitutionality of the statute as interpreted. Such challenges had to be brought in the superior court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which denied him bail pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.040 after he was found guilty of second degree murder, an unclassified felony. Defendant argued that &sect; 12.30.040 denied him his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection and that &sect; 12.30.040(b) unconstitutionally invaded the Alaska Supreme Court's rule-making power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder, an unclassified felony. The trial court entered an order denying bail pursuant to &sect; 12.30.040. Defendant appealed the order, and the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 12.30.040 did not deny defendant his due process and equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 3. There was no arbitrary discrimination among those convicted of dangerous crimes by allowing bail for some while denying it to others. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.040 was constitutional because the limitation on bail was rationally related to the legislative purposes of assurance of continued appearance and community protection. The court also concluded that &sect; 12.30.040(b) did not invade the Alaska Supreme Court's rule-making power. The statute did not conflict with Alaska R. Crim. P. 41, 32(a), or Alaska R. App. P. 206(b). The court concluded that Alaska R. Crim. P. 41(a) adopted by reference subsequent amendments Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.040(b), which specifically forbade bail to those convicted of unclassified felonies. The trial court had no inherent authority to grant bail in derogation of &sect; 12.30.040(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for sexual assault, sexual abuse of a minor, and for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He contended that the statutory definition of sexual contact included innocent conduct and that the statutes were, therefore, unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendant also challenged his sentences of imprisonment as excessive. On review, the court reversed the convictions for sexual abuse and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and the court affirmed the 10-year sentence for first-degree sexual assault, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court held that the trial court erred in its instructions regarding the mens rea required for sexual abuse of a minor and for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were father and son, appealed the judgment of the District Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, which convicted defendants of taking a black bear the same day airborne in violation of Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 81.075(A)(4). As a penalty, the father's Cessna 185 airplane was ordered forfeited to the state pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.900.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants shot a moose, salvaged most of the meat, and transported by plane to their permanent camp. When they returned later, defendants discovered a black bear on the moose carcass, and the son shot the black bear from the plane. The trial court convicted defendants of taking a black bear the same day airborne and ordered the forfeiture of either the airplane or the bond posted to obtain the release of the plane. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and the sentence. Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 81.375 was properly enacted in accordance with Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255, and when read together with &sect; 11.81.320, which defined the defense of necessity, established the only circumstances under which a defense of necessity could be interposed to a claim that game was illegally taken. Defendants failed to present some evidence on their own behalf that would have brought their conduct within the defense of necessity, and the trial court properly instructed the jury that the defense was unavailable. The loss of the plane was not intended as a fine but as a forfeiture, and thus, the order of forfeiture was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

On consideration of defendant's constitutional challenge to the ordinance, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test was admissible because the evidence was strongly probative of either guilt or innocence of the crime and not for the showing of any consciousness of guilt. The court held that the breathalyzer test, assuming that it was a search properly protected under Alaska Const. art. 1, &sect; 14 and U.S. Const. amend.

Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences to the court contending that his conviction for attempted second-degree murder must be set aside, and that the crime of attempted second-degree murder was logically impossible because Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.110 did not require intent to kill as a prerequisite to guilt. The court concluded that defendant could not be convicted of attempted second-degree murder even under the second-degree murder statute because a defendant who acted knowing that his conduct was substantially certain to cause death did not necessarily intend to kill given the definition in the revised code; therefore, defendant's conviction and sentences for attempted second-degree murder were reversed, and defendant's convictions for burglary and assault were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was ordered to pay restitution as well for his part in stealing and forging traveler's checks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised several issues on appeal. The court first found that, although Alaska R. Crim. P. 6(c)(1) required that grand jurors be selected from a population within a 50-mile radius of where the grand jury was convened, there was no showing of any prejudice by the fact that one grand jury resided 176 miles from the courthouse. The court then found that the trial court did not err in failing to suppress two inculpatory statements. The police officers who interviewed defendant only tape-recorded the last few minutes of the conversation. Although the Alaska Supreme Court required that police agencies record statements, the court refused to adopt a hard and fast rule that any statements made in violation of that requirement would be suppressed. The court found, at any rate, that the confession was voluntary given the totality of the circumstances. Furthermore, the court found no reversible error in the jury instructions, which did indicate that the property had to be &quot;stolen property&quot; in order to find defendant guilty of theft by receiving in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.190. Finally, the trial court had discretion in ordering restitution in the amount that it did.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant obtained large sums of money from her victim, who was a 62 year old man that had fallen in love with her. Defendant had asked for money from her victim for a variety of purposes that had turned out to be false. The victim considered all of the money that he gave to defendant to be a loan. Defendant had told the victim that she loved him and intended to move into his apartment. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss her indictment because the crime of theft by deception, as stated in &sect; 11.46.180, was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. Specifically, she claimed that &sect; 11.46.180 impinged on her constitutional right to freedom of speech because it restricted a form of speech, namely, deceptive speech. The court held that defendant's argument was without merit. The statutory prohibition against theft by deception was not directed against speech. Rather, it was intended to prohibit the unlawful taking of property by means of deception. Thus, defendant's conduct was regulated by &sect; 11.46.180 and speech was merely restricted incidentally as an element of the conduct proscribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two accomplices intended to burglarize a residence. The burglary turned into a homicide when one of defendant's accomplices shot the occupants to death. Defendant claimed the affirmative defense of duress. He argued that had he not participated, his accomplices would have killed him. The trial judge instructed the jury that defendant had the burden of proving the duress defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant objected to the trial court's instructions, arguing that placing the burden on him to prove his defense by a preponderance of the evidence was a violation of substantive due process. He renewed that argument on appeal. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the legislature did not violate substantive due process by placing the burden of proof on defendant to prove the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. The government still had to prove that defendant committed all the elements of the crimes of which he was convicted. However, once the government proved that defendant committed the crimes, he had to show that he was justified in committing the crimes in order to prove the defense of duress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was himself an inmate, was convicted of raping a fellow inmate. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In reaching its decision, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence, based on Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.45.045, Alaska's rape victim shield law. The court considered the application of the rape victim shield law in the context of a homosexual rape and ruled that the trial court's exclusion of the evidence at issue resulted in no violation of defendant's right to confront witnesses against him. Moreover, the court ruled that the trial court properly applied the rape victim shield law. Thus, the court concluded that the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in excluding evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in admitting a letter written by defendant to a prison official. The court concluded that no Miranda violation occurred because defendant volunteered the statements he made in the letter in the absence of police questioning.</SPAN></P>

The superior courts convicted defendants of forgery in the second degree, a class C felony and a violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.505(a)(1). The superior courts denied defendants' motions to dismiss the indictments as violative of their right to equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants attempted to cash stolen checks. Defendants filed pretrial motions that challenged the indictments on the basis that &sect; 11.46.505 violated their rights to equal protection guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court upheld defendants' convictions. The court held that the classification of a forgery offense as a felony, or as a misdemeanor under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.510(a), according to the type of instrument forged, was both reasonable and justified. The court held that neither statute violated equal protection because the State was required to prove additional elements to establish a felony forgery as compared to a misdemeanor forgery. The court found that the offense of felony forgery was clearly defined and distinguishable from misdemeanor forgery and that there were valid reasons for imposing a harsher punishment for the former offense. The court decided that, as the legislative classifications were not arbitrary, the fact that the same conduct violated both a general and a specific provision of those statutes did not render the legislation unconstitutional, even though one violation was subject to a greater sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a 29 year-old army sergeant when he procured two 16-year-old girls and one 14-year-old girl for prostitution. One of the girls began living with defendant and engaging in prostitution after defendant promised to marry her and to buy her things. Defendant assaulted one of the girls so the two others left him and contacted police. The police obtained a search warrant to record conversations between defendant and the girls. Defendant was convicted of promoting prostitution in the first degree and managing a prostitution enterprise. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the mistake of age defense was not available to defendant. The act of procuring another for purposes of prostitution was malum in se, without regard to the age of the person procured, and thus, in a prosecution for procuring a person under the age of 16 years, the intent to procure satisfied the minimal constitutional requirement of criminal intent. Multiple punishment was appropriate in this case because of the differences in intent and conduct between the two crimes defendant was convicted of and because of the differing societal interests furthered by the two statutes.</SPAN></P>

After he was convicted of the attempted robbery, and the trial court declared a mistrial as to the assault and murder, defendant entered a plea of no contest to a reduced charge of manslaughter. On appeal, defendant argued that allowing him to be convicted of attempted armed robbery and manslaughter violated double jeopardy and that the mistrial on the murder charge prohibited further prosecution on that charge. The court held that double jeopardy was violated by defendant's convictions for both attempted armed robbery and manslaughter because the attempted armed robbery was the underlying felony for the felony murder charge.

The court found that defendant accrued a number of fundamental rights protecting criminal defendants, including the right to bail pending conviction. The court concluded that if convicted, defendant had a statutory right to bail pending sentencing and appeal subject to certain qualifications. The court concluded that while defendant's constitutional right to bail might have lapsed with his conviction, defendant had accrued a sufficient statutory right to post-conviction bail at the time of his alleged offense to fall within the protection of Alaska Stat. &sect; 01.10.100(a).

He claimed that he did not notice anything about her behavior or demeanor that would indicated that she did not wish to have intercourse with him. Defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the first-degree, but acquitted of a kidnapping charge. He sought review challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 11.41.410, and arguing that he should have been given a directed verdict of acquittal on the kidnapping and sexual assault charges or, alternatively, more favorable jury instructions. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the state proved that defendant knowingly engaged in sexual intercourse and recklessly disregarded his victim's lack of consent. The court found that &sect; 11.41.410 did not punish harmless conduct and was neither vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been living with the victim for several years, but he indicated that he was dissatisfied with their relationship. For months they had been bickering, and defendant had contemplated suicide. A few days before the shooting, defendant discovered that the victim was seeing another woman, and she discussed shooting him or the woman with her friends. She confronted him but was dissatisfied with his responses, so she shot him as he bent over the sink to wash his hands. He staggered toward her, and she shot him again, and then shot him twice in the head as he lay on the ground. Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree. She appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the minimum sentence for first-degree murder was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that legislatures traditionally reserved the highest penalties for intentional homicide, established mitigating factors for homicides by differentiating between degrees of murder and between murder and manslaughter, and by enumerating specific defenses to murder. A sentence based on that distinction did not deny defendant the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were participants in a series of crimes that included the sexual assault of two teenage prostitutes, robbery, and attempted robbery. Acting on a tip, officer went to an apartment where defendants were believed to be. They were admitted by a teenage girl who answered the door. Once inside, defendants were discovered, along with various weapons, which were alleged to be in plain view of the officers. The apartment was then searched more intensively, and numerous items were recovered, which apparently linked defendants to the crimes. After being convicted, defendant appealed. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in finding that the officers had proper consent to enter the apartment and that the weapons were in plain view and therefore properly seized. However, the court found that the subsequent warrantless search of the apartment was illegal, but was unable to determine the effects of the search upon defendants' trial. Accordingly, the court remanded the matters for the appropriate determinations.</SPAN></P>

She removed and paid for a plastic shopping bag but did not pay for the gloves or for the socks. She placed two more pairs of gloves in the tote bag. She then exited the store and was apprehended at a refreshment stand nearby but outside the store. Defendant alleged that she was under medication, which made her thirsty, and that she left the store to buy a Coke. The trial court stated that it could not determine whether defendant had an intent to permanently deprive, but it convicted defendant of shoplifting, under &sect; 6.303(a). On appeal, the court held that: (1) &sect; 6.303(a) explicitly required an &quot;intent to deprive;&quot; (2) the term &quot;deprive,&quot; when used in a statute or in an ordinance to define larceny or a larceny-type offense, meant to permanently deprive; and (3) in order to violate &sect; 6.303(a), defendant had to have intended to permanently deprive the store of its merchandise.</SPAN></P>

He had been convicted of two prior felonies, the sale of LSD under former Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.12.010; and the sale of marijuana under former Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.12.010. He was sentenced to the presumptive three-year sentence reserved for third felony offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the applicability of the presumptive sentencing statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(e), which imposed a three-year sentence on any defendant who was convicted of his third felony. He also contended that the exclusion of voluntary intoxication or alcoholism as mitigating factors was irrational and deprived him of the equal protection of the laws. The court noted that the legislature's rejection of voluntary intoxication as a mitigating circumstance was consistent with the legislature's treatment of intoxication throughout the criminal code. It held that it was appropriate to exclude voluntary intoxication and alcoholism as mitigating factors in determining an appropriate sentence under the presumptive sentencing. The application of the presumptive sentence statute was appropriate because defendant had been convicted of two prior drug offenses that were treated as felonies when the presumptive sentence was imposed. It rejected defendant's contention that his pending appeal of a conviction precluded its inclusion for sentencing purposes. The change in status from a felony to an offense of the act underlying one conviction did affect the applicability of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, but it vacated the sentence due to a change in the status of the earlier marijuana conviction, and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Anchorage Superior Court, Third Judicial District (Alaska), which convicted defendant for theft by receiving in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.190. Defendant contended that the statute violated constitutional due process because it was vague, and because it required no criminal intent as an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the theft by receiving statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.190, violated constitutional due process by defining the conduct prohibited in a manner that was impermissibly vague and expansive, and by dispensing with the requirement of criminal intent as an element of the offense, thus rendering it a strict liability crime. Defendant contended that &quot;with reckless disregard&quot; created a broad and undefined standard. On appeal, the court held that the term &quot;reckless disregard&quot; in &sect; 11.46.190 had to be interpreted in light of the statutory definition of recklessness found in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(a)(3). The requisite degree of criminal intent for the offense of theft by receiving under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.190 was recklessness, and given the definition of the term in Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.900(a)(3), the criminal intent requirement of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.46.190 was neither vague nor undefined. The standard of &quot;reckless disregard&quot; was sufficient to meet the due process requirement of criminal intent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree robbery and assault, third degree theft, and criminal mischief. His aggregate sentence included a presumptive sentence of six years for each offense under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(c)(1). In a separate action, he pled guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced under &sect; 12.55.125(c)(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant robbed a store at gunpoint, he shot an officer and fled. Another officer, knowing of these events, pulled over a driver from whom defendant got a ride, as they were acting suspiciously. The officer saw defendant's partially concealed jacket by his leg. After defendant was arrested, another officer searched the jacket and found a paper bag containing the stolen money. The court held that the warrantless search was valid. It was incident to a lawful arrest for armed robbery, and evidence of that offense could have been concealed in personal property immediately associated with defendant. The presence of uniformed officers in the courtroom did not infringe on defendant's right to a fair trial, as there was no restraint or direct physical contact. The officer who was shot was not subject to sequestration, as the State identified him as important to its presentation. The trial court erred in failing to make express findings as to the aggravating circumstances it considered in imposing the sentence on the assault charge, in requiring other than a short form pre-sentence report, and in not holding a pre-sentence hearing to determine the existence of aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that conviction should have been reversed because jury was not instructed that in order to convict him the jury had to find proof that he had a specific intent to conceal and to permanently deprive the owner of merchandise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel requested an instruction that stated that a specific intent to permanently deprive the owner of the concealed merchandise was a necessary element for conviction. The prosecutor for the municipality argued that the ordinance required only general intent. The trial court refused to instruct the jury that intent to deprive the owner of property was a necessary element for conviction. The jury was instructed that general intent and the willful concealment of merchandise was necessary for conviction. On appeal the court held that the Anchorage ordinance must be interpreted to require an intent to conceal property. To construe the ordinance otherwise could lead to constitutional problems by allowing a person to be convicted of a crime where he had no criminal intent. Although the court noted that the instructions would have been better if the instruction on the elements of the offense had told the jury that the defendant had to have an intent to conceal the property, the instruction that stated that the jury had to find that the defendant &quot;wilfully concealed merchandise&quot; was adequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of felony escape, felony assault, and misdemeanor assault. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the trial court did not error by denying defendant's request for separate trials for the charges where all the charges grew out of a related series of events and the trial court could have anticipated that much of the evidence offered in support of one count would have been relevant to the others. The court held defendant was not entitled to a lesser included jury instruction for the escape charge where resisting arrest and attempted escape were not lesser included offenses of the escape. The court determined the offense of escape was completed when a person once in lawful custody, voluntarily removed himself from custody. The court concluded that because defendant had already been arrested when he broke free and ran, he could only be convicted of escape or acquitted. The court found even though the trial court erred by failing to give a jury instruction on general criminal intent, the error was harmless because there was no evidence presented from which the jury could have inferred mistake or confusion on the part of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the trial court's dismissal of the complaint against defendant. In so holding, the court found that: (1) roe, which was deposited by female salmon just prior to spawning, was in a class by itself, and was not clearly &quot;fish parts&quot; are defined in the statute; (2) provisions of other state statutes, such as Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.920(a), explicitly mentioned fish eggs along with fish parts; and (3) while the State was correct that a grave threat was posed to the salmon population by permitting the selling of roe, such a concern did not validate application of otherwise unconstitutionally vague regulatory language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile delinquent challenged his theft conviction, contending that money seized from his person by school officials should have been suppressed. The court rejected that argument, and affirmed. Juvenile was accused of having stolen cash from another student's clothing and, thereafter, school personnel searched, inter alia, juvenile's shoes. Cash was found in one of juvenile's shoes, in the same denominations as the student who was the victim of the theft had reported. Juvenile unsuccessfully sought to suppress the money as being the fruit of a search that violated the state and federal constitutions. On appeal from that decision, the court affirmed. It held that while the school officials in question were state actors, given that school attendance was compulsory, they were not law enforcement officers. Since the state and federal constitutions protected against illegal searches by law enforcement officers only, the exclusionary rule did not apply in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment below was affirmed. Although the state and federal constitutions protect school students against illegal searches and seizures, those protections were inapplicable when as here the searching parties were not law enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>

As a condition to his probation, the superior court ordered defendant to be incarcerated for five days prior to beginning the next school year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was placed on probation for possession of marijuana and ordered to serve five days in a youth center prior to the next school year. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, remanding the cause for resentencing on the five-day incarceration in the youth center. Defendant argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.12.110(d)(4) repealed Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 47.10.010(a)(1) and 47.10.080 insofar as the latter statutes would have otherwise given the children's court jurisdiction over minors accused of possession of marijuana. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(1) was consistent with Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(1) and therefore the trial court was the appropriate forum for defendant's prosecution. The court found that Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.12.110 was not unconstitutionally vague because it had no adverse effect on defendant's first amendment rights, defendant had clear notice of the conduct that was prohibited, and there was no risk of arbitrary enforcement. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to waive juvenile jurisdiction because there were no facts to support a finding that he was not amenable to treatment as a minor.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected the prosecution's contention that defendant's attorney waived his client's right to a jury trial. The court further recognized that defendant had to personally express his waiver.

He was tried before a jury, was found guilty of robbery but not guilty of theft, and was sentenced by the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, to a six-year term of imprisonment with one year suspended.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's brother threatened to throw him out if he did not obtain a job. Defendant then allegedly stole items from his brother's apartment and later that day used a gun stolen from the apartment in the robbery of a taxicab. Defendant was subject to a presumptive sentence of six years under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.125(c)(1), but one year of the presumptive six-year term was suspended. On appeal, the court held that it was appropriate to charge both offenses in the same indictment and there was no error in denying severance. The instruction on robbery was not erroneous; the State was not required to prove that defendant intended to permanently deprive another of property, and the robbery statute was not unconstitutional without the requirement of such intent. The jury was properly instructed to consider a lesser included offense only after it had acquitted defendant on the higher charge. The presumptive sentencing provisions of &sect; 12.55.125(c)(1) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine or conflict with Alaska Const. art. 1, &sect; 12.There was no error in the trial judge's failure to place defendant in a treatment program as an alternative to incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to soliciting for prostitution, and the district court placed defendant on probation with a special condition prohibiting defendant from being within a two-block radius of an area that was known for street prostitution. Defendant's probation was revoked, and the district court imposed a sentence. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District (Alaska), affirmed the revocation, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the area restriction was invalid because it was not reasonably related to the purposes of her probation and that the restriction was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The restriction did not have a chilling effect on First Amendment rights of defendant because defendant did not indicate that she was prevented from using legitimate businesses, services, or public facilities in the area. There was also no indication that it was necessary for defendant to travel through the area in her normal lawful activities. The restriction applied only to defendant and, thus, did not affect a certain class of individuals. Therefore, the restriction was not overbroad. The restriction was not so vague as to encourage arbitrary enforcement. Further, the restriction was reasonably related to the purposes of her probation for rehabilitation. The area restriction did not unduly impinge on defendant's liberty and was not unreasonable under the circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment that affirmed the district court's judgment revoking probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants sought review of judgments of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which convicted both defendants of armed robbery after the parties stipulated to a Cooksey plea and preserved a question of whether one defendant's confession was admissible against the second defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the first defendant was arrested at the second defendant's apartment for two armed robberies at shopping centers, he made a confession at the police station. The officer persuaded the first defendant to call his accomplice. During the telephone call, the officer then persuaded the second defendant to turn himself in to police. The second defendant then made a confession. Both defendants filed motions to suppress their confessions as fruits of an illegal arrest. The trial court concluded that the entry into the apartment and the first defendant's arrest were illegal, that no exigent circumstances were involved, but that the admissions were admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery. The court held that: (1) the warrantless arrest of the first defendant in his home was illegal; (2) the second defendant had standing to contest the search that resulted in the arrest of the first defendant in his home; (3) the second defendant's confession was not sufficiently attenuated from the first defendant's illegal arrest so that the taint of the unlawful entry of his home had not been dissipated; and (3) the inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the superior court's judgments that convicted both defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks entered upon his plea of nolo contendere to driving with a suspended license in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.05.291. On appeal, he asserted that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.05.121, the notice provision, was unconstitutional because it allowed the suspension of his license without actual notice to him that his license had been suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's license was suspended under Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.251 because he had accumulated 14 points for traffic violations within a 12-month period. The Alaska Department of Public Safety mailed a notice of the suspension to him pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.05.121. The notice was sent twice by certified mail, return receipt requested. The address was correct, but defendant was only in Alaska two days during that month and did not receive the letter. He was subsequently arrested for driving while his license was suspended, in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.291(a). On appeal, defendant argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.05.121 was unconstitutional because it allowed his license to be suspended without actual notice to him, turning Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.291(a) into a strict liability crime in violation of due process. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.121 was constitutional because it did not preclude defendant from asserting as a defense to the offense that he did not receive the notice. Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.291(a) contained an element of mens rea that had to be proven by the State. Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.05.121 did not permit a conviction without a showing of this mens rea.</SPAN></P>
