</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was conducting undercover surveillance of a suspected drug house. The officer observed defendant go into the house, leave shortly thereafter, and then drive to a liquor store. The officer approached defendant when he suspected a drug buy was taking place. The officer observed what he thought was marijuana in defendant's car. When the officer approached and told him he was under arrest, defendant sped off. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 575.150. While the evidence may not have supported the finding of an actual drug transaction such a finding was not necessary. The statute only required the officer to contemplate making a felony arrest. The officer clearly believed a drug transaction had taken place and made his decision to arrest based on that legitimate belief. Defendant's resistance was by a means other than flight, as the officer was struck by defendant's vehicle and partially dragged when defendant left the scene. Defendant was clearly aware the officer was from the police because the officer identified himself and showed his badge to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that granted respondent's motion to dismiss a petition for forfeiture under the Criminal Activity Forfeiture Act (CAFA), as contained in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 513.600 to 513.645 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the trial court's grant of respondent's motion to dismiss a petition for forfeiture under the CAFA. On appeal, the sole issue was whether the time limitations for state action after a seizure of property that had been used or intended for use or derived from criminal activity were mandatory. The court noted that where, as here, a statutory provision did not provide what results should follow a failure to comply with its terms, it was generally held to be directory. The court held that because a forfeiture was involved, even though no punitive means were provided, the time limitations in CAFA were mandatory. The court refused to broaden the scope of the legislative enactment to permit a forfeiture where it was not clearly authorized. The court noted that if the legislature decided to relax the requirements it had seen fit to impose in &sect; 513.607.5(2), then it alone must do so. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which affirmed an order of suspension and probation against him by the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission on an amended complaint by the state registration board that the physician violated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.100.1(10) (1978) for engaging in unethical or unprofessional conduct likely to harm the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's complaint against the doctor, an obstetrician-gynecologist, alleged that he engaged in a sexual relationship with a patient under his care. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The Commission did not abuse its discretion in its assessment of the need for expert testimony or its assessment of the patient's testimony regarding her relationship with the physician. Under &sect; 334.100.1(10), it was not necessary for the Commission to receive expert testimony to establish professional standards; the evidence was sufficient to support the decision that the physician engaged in unethical or unprofessional conduct. Section &sect; 334.100.1(10) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad in violation of the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because it gave reasonable notice of the proscribed activity and guidance for governmental enforcement of the statute in a nonarbitrary and nondiscriminatory fashion. Allowance to the board to file an amended complaint was not an abuse of discretion by the Commission. No prejudice existed to support the physician's invocation of the doctrine of laches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of kidnapping, assault in the first degree, and armed criminal action, after a jury trial. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion in limine and in failing to sustain his numerous objections to evidence of other crimes. The court affirmed his convictions. The court held that the evidence of the commission of other crimes was admissible to show motive. Two of the offenses with which defendant was charged involved specific mental states. Defendant further argued that even if the evidence of his commission of other crimes was relevant, the resulting prejudice outweighed the relevance of the evidence. The court ruled that the determination whether the relevance of such evidence outweighed any prejudice to defendant lied within the discretion of the trial court. The court found no abuse of that discretion. Defendant's contention that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence because the search warrant for said address was issued based upon an application and affidavit that did not contain a sufficient statement of probable cause was also without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant electric company appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Missouri) that granted declaratory relief in favor of plaintiff County of Warren and decreed that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.805 (1986) required an electric supplier to purchase electricity from a governing body's waste to energy plant at the actual amount it billed the governing body less unretained taxes imposed by the governing body.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county, seeking to own and operate a waste to energy facility, wrote to the electric company and requested it to purchase electricity from the proposed facility. The electric company replied that it was willing to enter into a contract, but only at a rate of its avoided costs. The county filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, requesting the circuit court to find that the language in &sect; 260.805 (1986) meant that same price the utility charged the governing body and was not limited to the utility's avoided cost. The electric company filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that under the statute it was not required to pay more than avoided costs. The circuit court ruled in favor of the county and the electric company appealed, arguing that payment for electricity in excess of avoided costs would be unlawful. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's decision, stating that until the Public Service Commission had taken action, it had no jurisdiction to rule upon the legality of any future rate that the commission would set. The court stated that the electric company's arguments, based on what the commission might or might not do, were purely speculative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's decision, stating that it would not reverse a declaratory judgment on the basis of future hypothetical or speculative situations which were not themselves ripe for judicial review. The court stated that determination of issues raised by the electric company would have been inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

The contractor entered into a contract to remove asbestos-containing materials for the project. The contractor paid his asbestos workers the wages as required by the wage determination. The contractor also hired hazardous waste helpers to assist the asbestos workers. The helpers were paid less than the asbestos workers.When the differential was revealed in an audit, the department assessed penalties against the contractor. The contractor filed an objection with the department. The department refused to hear the objection. The contractor sought judicial review and the trial court dismissed the actions. The contractor appealed. The court held that that the trial court erred in dismissing the actions. By the department refusing to hear the claim, the contractor had its right to full payment under the contract adversely determined by default. Therefore, the department's decision to refuse the contractor's request for a remedy was a final decision and reviewable by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order, which dismissed the contractor's actions against the department, and remanded both actions to the trial court for a hearing on the contractor's request for review of the department's actions and for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor, a citizen of plaintiff, the City of Hannibal, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Marion County (Missouri) in favor of defendant, the County of Marion, which held that Hannibal, Mo. Charter &sect; 20.25 (1957) which purported to exempt the city's citizens from paying county road taxes for roads or bridges outside its city limits, conflicted with Mo. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 3, 6 and, thus, was void and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had a legislative charter incorporating 1873 Mo. Laws 236, art. VIII, &sect; 1, which provided that the citizens of the city would be exempt from certain county taxes spent on items outside the city limits. In 1957, the city adopted a charter pursuant to Mo. Const. 1945, art. VI, &sect; 19, which required charters to be consistent with the Missouri Constitution. The citizen asserted an exemption to the county's taxes under Hannibal, Mo. Charter &sect; 20.25 (1957), which purportedly retained the exemption under 1873 Mo. Laws 236, art. VIII, &sect; 1 from the original charter. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment finding that Hannibal, Mo. Charter &sect; 20.25 (1957), was unconstitutional and void. The court held that &sect; 20.25 resulted in non-uniform taxation of the class subject to the county's taxes; thus, it was inconsistent with Mo. Const. 1945, art. X, &sect; 3, and art X, &sect; 6, which did not include the city among the exceptions to its provision declaring tax exemptions void. The court ruled that 1873 Mo. Acts 226, art. VIII, &sect; 1, despite inclusion in the original charter, was changed by Mo. Const. 1945, art. X, &sect;&sect; 3, 6; thus, it could not be readopted in the 1957 charter.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.020.1 (1986), and, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200.1(4) (Supp. 1988), sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of 25 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction that defined the word &quot;sale&quot; and that the penalty imposed on him was cruel and unusual punishment contrary to provisions of the Missouri Constitution and U.S&gt; Const. amend. XIII. The court concluded that the State failed to explicitly follow the model jury instructions, but that the State's error was not prejudicial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that defendant's claim regarding the unconstitutionality of his sentence was not raised in defendant's motion for a new trial and thus was not preserved for appeal. However, relying on the plain error doctrine, the court held that, unless the case was remanded for resentencing, manifest injustice would result, and ordered such a remand. During the time the case had been on appeal, the legislature had changed the range of punishment for the offense of which defendant had been convicted. Under the changed law, the maximum punishment that could be imposed was 15 years imprisonment. Defendant was entitled to benefit from the changed law because the change had occurred while his case was still pending.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police chief argued that: 1) the city's decision was unsupported by substantial evidence and was arbitrary and capricious; 2) the governing provisions allegedly violated were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and had been unconstitutionally applied; 3) the city did not submit conclusions of law as required; and 4) the city council's order was arbitrary and capricious because it did not specify separate discipline for each charge. The court disagreed with each argument. The court found that the city's action was supported by substantial evidence. It was not arbitrary and capricious. The record contained substantial evidence to show that the police chief took an active part in a campaign. He arranged a press conference, the express purpose of which was to prevent an opponent's reelection. He distributed the candidate's fund raising tickets to another officer. The restrictions were narrowly drawn and were constitutionally applied. Police personnel were permitted to participate in a wide range of political activities, provided they were off duty and in civilian attire. The conclusions of law were sufficient in detail to reveal the basis for the city council's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners were selling their land to the applicant, a corporation, so that the applicant could construct a convenience store on the site. However, because the applicant's request for a demolition permit to clear the site was denied, defendants also denied the applicant's petition for a building permit. Thus, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, administrative review of the permit denials, and damages and attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court granted the requests for administrative and injunctive relief and left the question of &sect; 1983 liability for later determination. Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the division of the remedy between the equitable and legal claims was not an order that could be certified for appellate review, and thus the portion of the order regarding &sect; 1983 and attorney's fees was non-appealable. However, the administrative review of the permit denials was an appealable order under Mo. R. Civ. P. 74.01(b), and the trial court's review was erroneous as plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's administrative review of plaintiffs' permit applications, affirmed its order preventing the demolition permit denial from affecting the building permit process, and dismissed the remainder of the appeal without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for mistrial after the arresting officer testified defendant made no response when asked whether the cocaine belonged to him, and that he did not consent to the search. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that circumstantial evidence demonstrated that defendant was aware of the presence and character of the cocaine and was intentionally and consciously in possession of it. There was direct evidence that defendant had put two items, money and a lighter, in the compartment and circumstantial evidence that he had put cigarettes there. It was inferable that the vial was readily visible, particularly as it was not beneath anything.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed an action against defendants alleging that they negligently caused the death of her daughter. The trial court entered judgment for defendants. The court reversed in part and remanded the claim against the treating physician for a new trial. The mother's equal protection claim was denied because defendants' discriminatory use of peremptory challenges did not involve state action. Batson was not applicable to the civil litigation between the private parties who were not represented by government counsel because the judge did not compel, but merely acquiesced in defendants' decision to discriminate. The treating physician's testimony, which included reference to a radiologist's out-of-court opinion, was inadmissible hearsay. It went directly to the critical issue whether he knew or should have known of the daughter's illness, and was not excepted from the hearsay rule to demonstrate that the treating physician acted reasonably because it was not information upon which he relied to form his opinion. It was a concurring opinion. The court affirmed the judgment for the diagnosing physician because the improper evidence was unrelated to the claim against her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retail store challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) dismissing its petition seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The store sought a declaration that Kansas City, Mo., Code of General Ordinances ch. 26, No. 63979 was unconstitutional, that the tobacco products for sale were not unlawful, and an injunction barring the city and police from enforcing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police informed the store that it was in violation of Ordinance 63979, which prohibited the sale of drug paraphernalia, for selling items which the store claimed were tobacco products. The police also said that if the items were not removed the store's employees would be arrested and the items seized. The trial court dismissed the store's petition for declaratory and injunctive relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the Declaratory Judgment Act was not to be used when an adequate remedy already existed. A declaration that the items were not drug paraphernalia would be in conflict with the provisions of the ordinance because, as the store admitted, a number of the items were generically described by the ordinance. The store also claimed that if not granted injunctive relief, it would suffer arrest of its employees, a severe loss of business, and possible bankruptcy. The court found that the claims that the store would suffer severe financial loss, without facts in support, constituted nothing more than conclusions; therefore, the store was not entitled to injunctive relief. The city had a valid interest in banning the sale of drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the store's request for declarative and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The lodge contended that under its lease, the city had a duty to provide it with access to the city sanitary sewer system at the city's sole cost and that Ordinance 673, in increasing the building permit fee and in creating the capacity fee, was illegal and unconstitutional because it impaired the obligations of the lease, and prescribed a building permit fee which was so excessive as to be unreasonable. The trial court found in favor of the city. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded, holding that the lodge was not required to pay the capacity fee prescribed by Ordinance 673 but was required to pay the building permit fee prescribed by the ordinance. The lease imposed on the city the duty to provide the lodge with sanitary sewers at no expense to the lodge and Ordinance 673, impaired the rights of the lodge under the lease. The city could not condition the issuance of the building permit upon such payment. However, the lodge failed to sustain its burden of showing unreasonableness of the building permit fee. The court reversed the order awarding the city attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief of police suspended the sergeant with forfeiture of all pay and allowances from the police force. The chief contended that the petition for writ was not timely filed and that the trial court erred in finding that the suspension was the result of an arbitrary and capricious act on the part of the chief. The court reviewed the file and the statements of the three persons directly involved in the interrogation of the suspect. Although there was conflict in the statements, the court found that the sergeant did order the detectives to interrogate the suspect after the suspect requested the presence of an attorney. After reviewing the documentary evidence, which was before the trial court, and assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the court concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the sergeant did violate the suspect's rights by ordering a detective to interrogate the suspect after he exercised his right to request an attorney. Because the sergeant ordered the detective to violate the suspect's rights by continuing the interrogation after he requested an attorney, it followed that the chief's decision was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

The measures also benefited the area around the stadium site and the land of adjacent private owners.

While parts of the transcript indicated defendant's reluctance to plead guilty, other parts showed defendant knew exactly what he was pleading guilty to. The transcript as a whole showed that defendant understood the charges, the availability of a trial, and that he willfully chose to plead guilty rather than face trial. The court rejected defendant's claim that he was entitled to post-conviction relief because his attorney failed to include in his amended motions his original claims of lack of a factual basis for his original plea. The court actually did consider those claims, even without the specific allegations of the original complaint. Defendant's claim that the trial court had no jurisdiction to accept his plea on the failure to appear charge because the trial court in the rape charge was without jurisdiction was rejected because it was an attempt to collaterally attack his rape conviction, which was affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court affirmed defendant's decision. The court affirmed, holding that the &quot;for cause&quot; standard in &sect;77.340 was not void for vagueness. The standard provided the flexibility needed for assessing the performance of public officials, but also created a constitutionally protected property interest that could be denied an office holder only upon notice of the specific causes for his proposed removal and after an opportunity to be heard. The bill of impeachment on which petitioner was tried was also not so indefinite that it violated procedural due process because the charges in the bill referred to specific acts or omissions allegedly committed by petitioner on specific dates.

The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion under Rule 29.15 based on untimeliness. The court held that the rule did not violate defendant's constitutional rights, and although it may have been harsh, because the delay was caused by the correctional center, the high court had held such challenges to filing deadlines to be without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners had 65 acres of property zoned non-urban, of which the commission condemned 8 acres for use in new highway construction. A report recommended an award of damages, to which both parties filed exceptions. Ten months later the landowners entered into a contract to sell the remaining property contingent on rezoning. The property was rezoned by ordinances, which purported to require dedication of the right-of-way, which the commission had already taken. The landowners claimed the trial court erred in admitting evidence that supported the finding of zero damages and that the prospect of dedication was irrelevant to calculation of the just compensation guaranteed to owners of condemned property. The court reversed. The commission had the burden of proof that a dedication requirement would have been constitutional based on a reasonable relationship between the dedication and the activity for which rezoning was sought. The commission made no effort to show the constitutionality of a dedication requirement. The dedication requirement in the rezoning ordinances enacted subsequent to the condemnation did not create a presumption of validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's stepdaughter was 15 years old in July or August 1987, the time of the first degree sexual assault with which defendant was charged. Defendant's daughter was 12 years old the time of the sodomy of which he was charged. She testified that he had sexual intercourse with her on two prior occasions. Defendant was also charged with child abuse based upon his excessive, injury-inflicting punishments administered to his stepdaughter, daughter, and son. During the trial, a pediatrician testified that she examined the stepdaughter on May 9, 1988, and that the absence of her hymeneal tissue suggested sexual intercourse. The trial court sustained plaintiff State's objection to defendant's cross-examination questions of the stepdaughter regarding other sexual activity she may have engaged in, on the basis of the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015 (1986). Defendant was convicted of all charges. The court reversed in part the judgment, by holding that defendant was put to an unfair disadvantage when he was not allowed to counter the inference that he sexually assaulted his stepdaughter by showing that other sexual activity could have accounted for her absence of the hymen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed an application with the DNR under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, Mo. Rev.

The DNR returned the application as incomplete because it did not provide adequate evidence of compliance with local zoning and permitting requirements. On review the court held that because the circuit court dismissed the action on the grounds that the city had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, the court was rendered powerless to consider the matter on its merits because it lacked the jurisdiction to do so. The city and the DNR claimed that the return of the application was not a denial. The court ruled that the city could not, on the one hand, assert that an administrative body had rendered a decision and, on the other hand, stress the incompleteness of the processing of the application. The action of the DNR in sending the application back to the city constituted a decision of that agency, which in turn triggered the provisions of review under Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Movant sought post-conviction relief. The motion court dismissed the motion on the basis that the petition was procedurally barred by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035(b) because the motion was not filed within 90 days after movant was delivered to the custody of the department of corrections as mandated by Rule 24.035(b). Movant appealed. The court held that the mandatory time limitations in Rule 24.035 were reasonable, served the legitimate interest of avoiding delay in the processing of prisoner's claims, and prevented the litigation of stale claims. Thus, the motion court did not err in dismissing movant's motion following evidentiary hearing. Movant was not denied due process due to the time limitations in Rule 24.035 because the time limitations of Rule 24.035 were found to be constitutionally valid by another court. Rule 24.035 did not operate as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

A sentence of 10 years on each count, to run consecutively, was vacated, but movant was resentenced to the same terms on February 14, 1984. Movant filed a pro se motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 on September 20, 1988. The trial court denied the motion on grounds of untimeliness because movant failed to file it before June 30, 1988. Movant appealed and contended that the rule was unconstitutional and violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. V. The court affirmed the trial court judgment and held that the record clearly showed that sentence was pronounced before January 1, 1988, and therefore movant was required to file his motion by June 30, 1988. The court held that movant's constitutional claim was without merit since the rule was held to be constitutionally valid in a prior case. The court also held that rule did not have a res judicata effect on the constitutional right to habeas corpus. The court further rejected such claims because movant failed to make the constitutional challenges before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 16-year-old son died after the insured, the stepfather of the son's friends, either injected the son with cocaine, assisted the son in injecting himself with cocaine, or supplied the son with cocaine knowing that he would inject it. The insurer sought a declaration that the actions of the insured were excluded under the &quot;expected or intended&quot; exclusion of his homeowners' policy. In reversing the trial court's order that entered judgment for the insured, the court held that the trial court erroneously applied the law. The court ruled that if the insured's actions were reckless, his conduct could be equated to expecting harm, and the exclusion of coverage clause would be triggered. The insured's two related convictions of manslaughter and cocaine distribution furnished substantial evidence of the insured's recklessness; hence, his expectation of harm to the son was established. Furthermore, because cocaine was a dangerous drug, the insured's acts were such that his intent to harm the son could be inferred as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and his right to a speedy trial was violated. The court held that in determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict the court viewed the evidence and all inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict and disregarded all contrary evidence and inferences. The court stated that the test was whether the evidence, so viewed, was sufficient to make a submissible case from which rational jurors could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty. The court determined that the evidence showed that defendant had thrown bed sheets at the jailer and knocked over a deputy before fleeing. The court noted that this evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because defendant did not assert his right and was in prison while awaiting trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the operation of the time limitations provided in Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15(m) acted to deny him due process of law, denied him his rights to habeas corpus, and denied him equal protection of law. His argument under due process of law was that he was arbitrarily denied post-conviction relief since Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 made no provision for late filing in cases where the motion was not filed through no fault of defendant. His contention that he was denied equal protection of law was based on allegations that he was not informed of the strict time limitations contained in Rule 29.15 whereas defendants sentenced after January 1, 1988, were provided with an explanation and notice of the limitations. The court affirmed and held that failure of a trial court to notify defendant of the time limitations of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 or Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 did not override the mandatory time limitations. Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 did not operate as an unconstitutional suspension or the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) forgery was a writing capable of fraudulent use, made false with intent to defraud; (2) the Batson challenge was properly rejected because the prosecutor produced a nondiscriminatory reason for his peremptory challenge; (3) the jury could well have inferred an intent to defraud; (4) there was probable cause that the appellant had committed an offense, the arrest was lawful, and the search incident to arrest was valid; (5) Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant prisoner appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Washington County (Missouri), which denied his motion for post-conviction relief filed pursuant to Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 after an evidentiary hearing. The prisoner had been convicted by a jury of attempted robbery in the first-degree, armed criminal action, and assault in the second-degree and was sentenced as a prior offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner contended the motion court erred in failing to vacate his sentences. First, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 557.021.2 (1986) had no application to the armed criminal action offense. The absence of a stated maximum penalty merely indicated a legislative intent that a defendant convicted of that offense could be sentenced to any term of years above the minimum, including life imprisonment. The court also held that the prisoner's claim that his counsel was ineffective failed because the prisoner failed to provide a copy of his arrest warrant or of the transcript of the suppression hearing. Finally, although the court affirmed the prisoner's convictions, the court ruled that his sentence should be set aside because the trial judge's remarks to the prisoner's relatives indicated that he was penalized for exercising his right to a trial by jury. The trial judge's testimony clearly revealed that he imposed the maximum sentence on each count and consecutive sentences because the prisoner refused to plead guilty. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 557.036 (1986), the trial judge had a duty to impose a punishment which fit the crime and the prisoner's criminal history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the motion court upholding the prisoner's convictions. The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion to vacate and set aside the sentences and remanded the cause solely for the purpose of resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The second count of the holder's petition was an application for a hardship driving privilege under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.309.3 (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holder's license was revoked due to her refusal to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcohol content of his blood after an arrest for driving a motor vehicle on the thoroughfares of the state. The holder sought review in the circuit court, and the circuit court entered a judgment in favor of the holder. The Director sought review. Vacating the circuit court's judgment and dismissing the holder's petition, the court held that the &quot;judgment&quot; to reinstate the holder's license did not support an adjunctive proceeding, which had occurred more than 30 days after notice of revocation. The petition for review of the revocation was not filed by the holder until more than one year after the revocation order. The Director argued that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear the holder's application for a hardship driving privilege. Furthermore the court held that unsworn statements of trial counsel do not prove themselves or constitute evidence. Therefore, the &quot;oral testimony&quot; of counsel regarding the holder's hardship was not sufficient to support the circuit court's &quot;judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the holder's motion to dismiss the Director's appeal. Accordingly, the court vacated and the circuit court's judgment and dismissed the holder's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was driving a car registered in his and his wife's names when he was stopped by police. The driver failed to produce an insurance identification card when asked to do so, and the police notified the Director pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 303.024 (1986). The Director notified the driver that his license and registration would be suspended unless he produced evidence of insurance. After an administrative hearing, the hearing officer determined that respondents were in violation of Missouri's financial responsibility laws. The circuit court reversed the hearing officer's order temporarily revoking the driver's license and respondents' registration. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that a suspension pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 303.041 (1986) could not result from an officer's stop of a vehicle absent probable cause for the stop. The Director did not provide any evidence for the reason that the driver's vehicle was stopped.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.150.1 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney had worked as staff counsel for the former employer, a non-profit organization which sponsored civil rights litigation. The former employer's policies required its staff counsel to pay over to it any court-awarded fees. The attorney acted as counsel for a plaintiff in a successful civil rights action that resulted in an award of attorney's fees to the plaintiff. The attorney, who had resigned from his position, refused to turn over his portion of the fee to the former employer. The court reversed the judgment, holding that no contractual obligation existed because the former employer's fee-sharing policy violated &sect; 484.150.1 and Mo. R. Prof. Conduct 4(5.4). Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.150.1 was not unconstitutional as applied to the former employer. The former employer did not establish conversion because it did not show that it had a property right in the fee that carried the right to immediate possession. The court held that because the agreement between the attorney and the former employer was not an assignment, the former employer had failed to show unjust enrichment by establishing that a benefit was conferred upon the attorney at the former employer's expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment that had denied the attorney's summary judgment motion and had granted summary judgment to the former employer in its action alleging that the attorney was obliged to turn over a legal fee to the former employer. The action was remanded to the trial court for the entry of summary judgment in favor of the attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the movant's conviction and sentence for three counts of rape had been affirmed on appeal, he filed a pro-se motion for post conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion court denied the motion without a hearing on July 10. Movant then appealed denial of his first motion on August 8. On August 11, movant's public defender filed an amended motion requesting a hearing. On August 28 the motion court made findings of fact and conclusions of law stating that the amended motion was untimely and should be disregarded, and that trial counsel's failure to call impeachment witnesses was a mater of trial strategy. On review, the court affirmed the last judgment of the motion court, treating it as a motion to correct a clerical error under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.06(a). The court rejected movant's argument that the motion court had erred in failing to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15(i), holding that the first order was not final. The court also held that the motion for an evidentiary hearing was properly denied under R. 29.15(g) because it was not timely made.</SPAN></P>

However, the court ruled that the city charter mandated that violations of city ordinances be adjudicated in the municipal court. The court also concluded that violations of the ordinance were required to be prosecuted by the city attorney by information. The ordinance could not be enforced as a matter of private right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's brother was injured in a car bombing. Defendant and several associates determined that the victim was one of the men responsible for the bombing. Defendant directed the associates to find the people responsible for the bombing. The associates constructed a bomb, which they placed on the victim's car. Defendant was charged with capital murder. At trial defendant requested a manslaughter instruction over the State's objection. On appeal from his conviction of manslaughter, defendant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on manslaughter and in entering judgment convicting him of that crime. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. A manslaughter conviction could not stand unless there was evidence of adequate provocation in the record; the provocation had to be sudden and sufficient to indicate an absence of malice and premeditation. The evidence indicated that defendant planned the murder for more than a year and that defendant was not present when the murder occurred. Although defendant requested the instruction, he raised a specific objection to that instruction in his motion for a new trial in accordance with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 28.03.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two children in defendant's care stated that defendant sexually abused them. Defendant was later convicted on sodomy charges. On appeal, defendant argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 492.304 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court held that the doctrine of vagueness in criminal law was directed at statutes that specify the criminal conduct on which charges are based, so that the potential violators know what standards of behavior they must adhere to. Therefore, a constitutional challenge to a statute relating to the admission of evidence on the basis of indefiniteness and overbreadth was without legal foundation. Next, defendant argued that the trial court erred in the admission of the testimony of the various witnesses concerning extra-judicial statements of the children. The court held that it was clear from the record that defendant received notice of the children's statements sufficiently in advance of trial to have a fair opportunity to prepare to meet the statements. Lastly, the court held that a Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 hearing was not required because the record established that defendant was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

The General Assembly's finding that life began at conception, construed in light of the present law declared by the U.S. Supreme Court and the preamble, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;1.205, that the rights of the unborn were subject to the Constitution, did not vary the holding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of forcible rape, sodomy, and armed criminal action, and was sentenced as a persistent offender with terms running consecutively for a total of 23 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 motion, appellant alleged that the trial court was without jurisdiction to try, convict, or sentence him on the Class A felonies of rape and sodomy because he had not been charged with Class A felonies. Appellant alleged that his conviction for armed criminal action subjected him to double jeopardy, violating his right to due process. The court rejected appellant's allegation that he was convicted of charges that were not included in his indictment. The indictments read that appellant committed the felonies of forcible rape and sodomy by having sexual intercourse and deviate sexual intercourse with the victim to whom movant was not married, without her consent, and by the use of forcible compulsion. Neither of those acts was a Class A felony. Because the sentences imposed were within the range authorized under the statutes for forcible rape and sodomy, the court found that appellant's claim that he was tried, convicted, and sentenced on charges that were not charged in his indictment was without merit. The court also found that the double jeopardy contention was meritless because appellant was neither charged nor convicted of Class A rape or sodomy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri), which denied his motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant asserted that the motion court erred in failing to make more specific and complete findings of fact and conclusions of law, pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26(i). Findings of fact and conclusions of law would be deemed sufficient if they enabled a reviewing court to determine whether those finds may be judged clearly erroneous. No error could result from a failure to make finding of fact or conclusions of law on claims which were not supported by substantive evidence or on claims not cognizable under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26. The court refused to allow defendant to relitigate issues concerning the admissibility of certain photographs which had already been decided on direct appeal. Defendant attacked the constitutionality of Missouri's capital murder statute but the court found that these constitutional claims could not be raised by this post-conviction motion. A claim that defendant's counsel failed to object to certain testimony was a trial error, not cognizable under this motion. Defendant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to call his sister as a witness but did not show that her testimony would have presented a viable defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband, who was incarcerated, and the wife were married at a penitentiary. Approximately five years later, the husband filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage and requested approximately $ 5,000 worth of property from the marital estate. The wife filed a cross-petition for annulment and alleged that she had believed that her husband was legally capable of entering into a marriage, but he was not because he was a convict, and that the marriage had never been consummated. The trial court granted the annulment, finding that the husband was a convict and could not legally marry and that the parties had not lived together or consummated their marriage. On appeal, the court held that the statute suspending all civil rights of a convict had been held unconstitutional and that there was a constitutional right to marry. Consequently, the trial court erred in its declaration and application of the law. In reversing the judgment, the court held that a ceremonial marriage was valid notwithstanding that it was not consummated by coition and that the wife failed to meet her burden of proving the invalidity of the marriage, so there was no evidence to warrant an annulment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restrictive covenants allowed &quot;for sale&quot; signs to be displayed only on weekend afternoons. When the homeowners violated this provision, the homeowners' association removed the signs. The court declined to address the homeowners' constitutional claims, as well as several other claims, because the homeowners had not raised them until the filing of their appellate brief. Turning to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.317, which prevented a political subdivision from enacting or enforcing ordinances that banned &quot;for sale&quot; advertising, the court stated that the language of &sect; 67.317 was also consistent with the free and untrammeled use by an owner of private property and that the restrictive covenants were consistent with public policy in favor of planned community developments. It held that the restrictive covenants allowed the homeowners' association to remove the offending signs without the need for an easement. Finally, it held that the trial court could have reasonably found from the evidence that the homeowners' association did not selectively enforce, and thus waive, the sign restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convict made his motion for post-conviction relief after his appeal had been denied. The trial court found that the convict's failure to file a motion on or before June 30, 1988 amounted to a complete waiver of his right to relief under Rule 29.15(m). Per Rule 29.15(m), if sentence were pronounced before January 1, 1988, and no prior motion had been filed pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26, a motion via Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 could be filed on or before June 30, 1988, and failure to file a motion on or before June 30, 1988 constituted a complete waiver of the right to proceed using Rule 29.15. The court held that the time limit of Rule 29.15 was constitutional and mandatory. The court ruled that the convict's alleged ignorance of the repeal of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 and enactment of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.15 was not a defense. The court ruled further that even if the motion for relief under Rule 29.15 were treated as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, it had no jurisdiction to reverse the trial court's denial of such a writ; there was no appeal from a decision in a habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for 50 years. She filed a motion for post-conviction relief. A hearing on her motion was not held until six years later. The trial court denied her motion. Her ineffective assistance of counsel claim was based on the failure of her trial attorney to object to jurisdictional defects in the arrest warrant, failure to present evidence to the jury regarding the creditable of the informant, failing to disqualify the trial judge, admission of polygraph evidence, and other errors. The court found that none of her assigned errors were meritorious. The court noted that the evidence did not show that movant had either failed or taken the polygraph, therefore there was no prejudice established by the failure to object. The court held that the fact that the trial judge asked three questions did not indicate partiality by him and a motion to disqualify him would have been meritless.

</DIV>

The partners also challenged the trial court's award of attorney fees plus costs to the corporation and against the partners. The corporation filed a motion seeking additional attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership purchased land from two individuals and the corporation. One partner worked as their agent and originated the idea of developing a self-storage project. The agent oversaw the preparation of an application to rezone the property, which, under &sect; 29-34(a)(3), required the filing of a list of all landowners within certain lines. The list of landowners accompanying the sellers' application failed to include the corporation. Because it was not included on the sellers' list, notice of the rezoning hearings was not mailed to the corporation. The trial court found that the agent intentionally omitted the corporation. The court held that: (1) although the notice provided satisfied the requirements of &sect; 29-34(a)(4), the notice requirements by themselves did not obviate the list of landowners requirement of &sect; 29-34(a)(3); (2) the partnership benefited by the agent's misconduct, but this alone did not justify the award of attorney fees under any partnership theory; (3) nor was it a special circumstance justifying the award of attorney fees as costs under Mo. R. Civ. P. 87.09; and (4) therefore, the award of attorney fees against the other partners was inequitable and unjust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to determine the equitable amount of attorney fees to be awarded to the corporation and against the agent. The court denied the corporation's motion for additional attorney fees incurred in defending the appeal, or, alternatively, as a sanction against the partners for filing a &quot;frivolous appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's Civil Service Commission concluded that the fire fighter's public threat against an alderman was conduct and speech by a Battalion Chief prohibited by the city's Charter and the Commission's Rules. The Commission ordered that the fire fighter be suspended without pay for 28 days. The fire fighter then filed a four-count petition in the circuit court. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and the fire fighter filed a motion for a partial summary judgment against the city on the issue of liability. On appeal, the court held that the fire fighter did not attempt to by-pass the Administrative Procedure Act. He was pursuing his administrative and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 remedies simultaneously and fully pursued his administrative remedy, obtaining a reversal of the Commission's decision, before proceeding with his &sect; 1983 action. The fire fighter had ample notice and opportunity to use discovery to establish operative facts supporting the inference that the Commission's decision was &quot;arbitrary and capricious.&quot; The questioning of a city employee by a city's personnel director did not violate an employee's First Amendment rights; thus, the Director's conduct was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sergeant was allegedly involved in a kidnapping in another municipality in the course of investigating the victim's involvement in an extortion scheme. After the sergeant was questioned by the city's police chief regarding the incident, he asserted his Fifth Amendment rights on the advice of counsel and refused to cooperate with the internal investigation. The chief placed the sergeant on suspension and eventually the city fired him. That decision was affirmed by the board and then by the trial court. On further appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. State law did not provide for immunity. However, the Fifth Amendment itself prohibited the use of the sergeant's statements or their fruits because they would have been made under the threat of dismissal from public office. Therefore, by advising the sergeant that his statements, when given under threat of discharge, could not have been used against him in subsequent criminal proceedings, the chief was not granting immunity from prosecution but was merely advising him of the constitutional limitations on any criminal prosecution should he answer. Therefore, his refusal to cooperate provided adequate grounds for the dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which denied his motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 after an evidentiary hearing. Movant contended in part that the hearing court erred by failing to vacate his first-degree felony murder conviction in order to remedy a double jeopardy violation and by finding that his guilty plea was voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant was originally charged with capital murder and kidnapping. Relatives urged movant to plead guilty to a reduced charge of first-degree felony murder and kidnapping. He was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment on the felony murder charge and a concurrent 10-year term on the kidnapping charge. The hearing court found that movant was subjected to double jeopardy and vacated the kidnapping sentence, which had already been served. The hearing court denied the motion to vacate the felony murder conviction. The court upheld the hearing court's judgment. The court agreed that the imposition of two sentences upon a defendant convicted of both felony murder and the underlying felony violated double jeopardy rights. However, the court did not agree that the felony murder conviction had to be vacated once the lesser kidnapping sentence had been served. The hearing court's remedy of vacating movant's kidnapping sentence and leaving intact the life sentence for the felony murder conviction fully vindicated movant's double jeopardy rights. The constitution did not require that sentencing should be a game in which a wrong move by the judge meant immunity for the prisoner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed. The court held that review of the denial of defendant's motion in limine to prevent evidence of prior convictions was not preserved for review given review of the denial of a motion in limine was an interlocutory order. The court also held that the prosecutor's proffered jury instructions that specified defendant's prior convictions was not unduly prejudicial to defendant given they conformed to the Mo. Approved Instructions prescriptions. Denial of a mistrial for comments about bullets found in defendant's car that were immaterial to the murder case was upheld given a curative instruction was given to the jury.

The officers then placed defendant under arrest and read him his Miranda rights. Subsequently defendant spit another plastic bag onto the sidewalk. Inside the bag were more capsules. The capsules were later identified as cocaine and heroin. The court held that a &quot;class X offender&quot; was one who had previously been found guilty of three felonies committed at different times. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019.4(3) (1986).

The court reasoned that by the adoption of &sect; 537.053, the former common law rule against dram shop liability was effectively reinstated. The court further rejected the individual's contention that the legislature did not intend to prohibit intoxicated persons from recovering for their own injuries. The court held that according to the plain language of the statute, there was no dram shop liability. The court held that a limited exception existed only where a tavern owner had been convicted or received a suspended imposition of sentence for the sale of intoxicating beverages to a person under the age of 21 or to an obviously intoxicated person, and then only if the sale was the proximate cause of the personal injury or death.

The court reviewed the record and held that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the ordinances were void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck a two-year old child with his car when the child ran into the middle of the street. Defendant left the scene of the accident. The child died three days later from a severe head injury. The car defendant was driving had been stolen almost seven months before the day that defendant struck the child. Defendant was convicted and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss on grounds of the unconstitutional application of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.021.1(2) (1986), the felony murder statute. The State clearly met its burden in proving defendant had the requisite mental state for the felony of tampering in the first degree at the time of the incident, even though the car was actually stolen seven months prior. The court concluded that first-degree tampering was a proper foundation for the application of the felony murder statute. Evidence of other crimes was inadmissible, but when the criminal conduct was part of a continuous occurrence intimately connected with the crime for which defendant was being tried, it was admissible.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that there was no error in precluding introduction of the victim's alleged prior sexual activity pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015 (1986). There was also no error in not striking a venireperson who initially said he would favor police officers' testimony because he also said he would evaluate such testimony the same as any other. There was no improper bolstering of the victim's testimony by other witnesses. The testimony was not totally duplicative and was admissible to explain various matters. Neither was there any harm in refusal to grant defendant's motion to interview two persons before trial, as they were not witnesses. The court found no error in forcing defense counsel to turn over his notes of his interview with the victim because the notes were not attorney work product. Finally, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's instruction regarding character and reputation, as it was not relevant to the crimes. The court concluded that the prosecutor's remarks in closing argument were not egregious enough to require a mistrial and that &sect; 491.015 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The employee requested a hearing from the mayor, which hearing was held before the aldermen. The employee was present and represented by counsel. The aldermen voted to uphold the termination. The employee then filed a petition against the city, the police chief, the mayor, the city administrator, and the aldermen, later dismissing the administrator and the aldermen. The employee claimed that he was entitled pursuant to city ordinances to certain contractual and procedural rights that were denied him. Summary judgment was granted against the employee and he appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the city ordinance, City of Northwoods Ordinance 80.8 purporting to afford certain contractual rights to a city employee was void because it conflicted with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79.240 (1986), which provided that the employee, as an employee at will, could be dismissed at will by respondents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A physician negligently performed surgery on the patient. The patient argued that provider was liable for the physician's negligence under the doctrine of corporate negligence because if the provider had investigated the physician's credentials it was have uncovered medical malpractice claims filed against him. The patient was a subscriber to the provider's health care plan. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 354.125 (1978) provided immunity to health services corporations for injuries caused by negligence. The patient argued that &sect; 354.125 was unconstitutional. The court held that because the provider limited the patient's access to physicians acceptable to the provider, an unreasonable risk of harm was created to subscribers if the physicians were unqualified. Thus, the provider had a common law duty to investigate its physicians. However, &sect; 354.125 gave the provider immunity. The provider was considered a health services provider because it was a not-for-profit corporation that provided reimbursement for health care services rather than providing the services.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State played for the jury the eight-year-old victim's videotaped statement to police at the time the incident was reported. The State also called the victim to the stand. The court noted that defendant did not object to the introduction of the videotape, except at a pretrial hearing. The court held that by failing to object when it was offered into evidence, defendant failed to preserve the issue for review. The court also noted that the constitutionality of &sect; 492.304 (1986) was raised for the first time on appeal and that the rule was that to preserve a constitutional issue, it must be raised at the earliest time consistent with good pleading and orderly procedure. The offenses were charged as having occurred on or about a certain date. Defendant argued that the jury should have been instructed as to the precise date and time of the offenses. The court held that time was not of the essence for sexual offenses and that when a specific date was impossible to fix, the instruction could be modified to identify the occurrence by some other reference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed in an adult book store, surrounded by sexually oriented books, magazines, videos, sex toys and artificial sex organs. A witness and two associates entered the store, selected two adult magazines, and told defendant that they wanted to purchase them. She told them the price, accepted the money from the witness and rang the magazines up. Defendant was convicted of promoting pornography in the second-degree. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the contents of the magazines constituted unadulterated and unmitigated smut. The court determined that no rational person could have found either magazine, taken as a whole, to have any literary, artistic, political or scientific value. In addition, sufficient evidence was presented by the State from which any rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew the character and content of the magazines. Finally, evidence of the mere availability of similar materials was not by itself sufficiently probative of community standards for admission into evidence, absence proof that the material enjoyed a reasonable degree of community acceptance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, which was a corporation running a bookstore, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which convicted it of seven counts of promoting pornography in the second degree, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.030 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All the counts involved pornographic magazines. The crux of the charge against defendant was the promotion of pornographic materials for pecuniary gain. Defendant was convicted, fined, and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed and remanded it in part. The court upheld defendant's argument that the trial court erred in overruling its objections to the use of certain police reports to refresh the recollections of two police detectives. The court ruled that the trial court erred in permitting the use of the police reports without a proper foundation, thus two counts needed to be reversed. The court found that the record did not exhibit a lack of present memory nor the need for the aid of a writing for recall before the witnesses were allowed to look at the police reports which were never admitted into evidence. The court rejected defendant's argument that that the sentences imposed were excessive and constituted cruel and unusual punishment in the circumstances of the case in that they were disproportionate to the offenses committed. The court held that punishment within the range prescribed by statute could not be judged excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to five of the counts and reversed and remanded the judgment as to two of the counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed an action in the Circuit Court of Franklin (Missouri), seeking a declaratory judgment following the denial of their application for a rezoning of their property from residential to commercial. The trial court concluded it had no jurisdiction and sustained a motion to dismiss filed by defendants, a county and related parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that prohibiting the commercial development of their property under the existing zoning order was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unconstitutional. Defendants argued that the rejection of the owners' application for rezoning was not a determination of general policy, but an adjudicative decision concerning a particular party that was therefore a quasi-judicial or administrative decision, rather that an exercise of legislative power. Thus, defendants argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.870.2 (1978), which lacked any time limitation for the filing of a petition for review of a county commission zoning order, must be read in pari materia with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.110.1, thus supplying a 30-day limitation for the filing of a petition for review. Reversing the dismissal of the owners' petition and remanding the cause, the court rejected the argument that the owners' petition was untimely. The petition was not an appeal, but an action for a declaratory judgment due to an adverse legislative function. Thus, it was not governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 49.230, which provided that appeals from county commission orders would be conducted under the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Adair County (Missouri) that convicted her of sodomy, alleging that her right to confrontation, guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment and Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's sodomy trial, a videotape of the deposition of the child victim, which defendant was not permitted to attend, was presented into evidence. Defendant was convicted and appealed from the judgment, asserting that her right to confront the witness, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 16(a), was violated. The court observed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.680, videotape recordings of child victims were permitted for use as substantive evidence at a trial upon motion of the prosecutor. The court further noted that, before the motion was granted, the State was required to produce evidence regarding the trauma that the child would have suffered if ordered to testify at trial. Because the State did not introduce any evidence as to the emotional or psychological trauma the child victim would have suffered by being required to testify in the presence of defendant, the videotape deposition improperly was presented into evidence. The deposition was a crucial part of the evidence against defendant, and its admission at trial constituted reversible error. The court reversed and remanded the judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing. The court held that the explanations provided by the State regarding the challenging of jurors were legitimate and racially neutral. Defendant did not present a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. It was not error for the State to challenge the credibility of a principal witness who had a familial relationship with defendant. The court held that the State's closing argument was a permissible attack on the credibility of an alibi witness. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019 (1986), as it applied to defendant, was an ex post facto law, having become effective after the crimes were committed, and thus violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action, appellant police officer, individually and on behalf of other police officers, challenged the decision from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which denied the police officer's challenge against respondents, police retirement system, city, and board of trustees, for a refund of retirement contributions. The police officer alleged that setting a cutoff point was discriminatory and violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.253(4) (1986) required that police officers upon retirement should have been repaid the amount of their contributions to the retirement system. A related law was interpreted as setting a date of September 28, 1981, as the point where a retired officer would or would not be entitled to a refund. The police officer retired before that date and was ineligible. Respondents contended that the police officer would have received more than he was entitled to if he received a refund and that the retirement system could not afford the cost. The circuit court agreed, and the appellate court affirmed. The court first found that the rational basis test applied. The rules concerning retirement were rationally related to a State purpose of adequately funding retirement. Police officers were not a suspect class entitled to strict scrutiny review. Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 39(3) prohibited a city for giving extra compensation to an employee whose services were already rendered. The court rejected the argument that the contributions were &quot;earned compensation&quot; rather than &quot;extra compensation.&quot; In summary, the retirement scheme passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sergeant resigned from his employment after he was told that he would have to resign from the association or be fired. He argued that the action violated his constitutional right to freedom of association. On appeal from the declaratory judgment that the sergeant had a right to be a member of the association, the court reversed, finding that U.S. Const. amend. I, Mo. Const. art. I., &sect;&sect; 8 and 9, and the Public Sector Labor Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.510, did not guarantee a supervisory police officer a right to belong to the association. The court exercised its discretionary jurisdiction to review the moot issue. The court discussed freedom of association, finding that the freedom provided public employees with the right to organize and to belong to labor unions and noting that the freedom should not be confused with the right of collective bargaining. The court held that the police department had a right to prohibit a supervisory officer from belonging to an association which included subordinate officers and which performed the activities of a labor union. The government had a legitimate interest in subjecting public employees to some regulation for the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

She and her husband brought a lawsuit against the city in which she claimed that the unevenness of the slabs created a dangerous condition, and that the city breached its duty to repair the condition. The city claimed that the husband and wife failed to notify the mayor of the claim within 90 days of the occurrence as was required by its charter. The city filed an amended motion for summary judgment based on this defense. The trial court sustained the motion, and the city challenged the order. On appeal, the court held that the city was not subject to the notice-of-claim statutes. The court found that the city's ordinance was patterned after a statute similar to one that the Missouri Supreme Court found was constitutional. Relying on this decision, the court rejected the claim of the husband and wife that challenging the ordinance on equal protection grounds. The court found without merit the claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was inconsistent with state law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant's Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion was denied after an evidentiary hearing. Movant argued that the trial court erred when it failed to issue findings regarding: (1) trial counsel's ineffectiveness in failing to file a writ of prohibition to stop criminal proceedings against her because the statute under which she was charged was later ruled unconstitutional; (2) the insufficiency of the indictment; (3) counsel's ineffectiveness in failing to object to certain jury instructions; and, (4) error in the trial court's scienter instructions. Movant did not raise the first issue at the hearing; thus, there was no error. The indictment was not insufficient because it did contain the word &quot;unlawfully&quot; on its face, contained all elements of the offense charged, and gave the movant adequate notice. Counsel's failure to object to certain jury instructions were not reviewable under the R. 27.26 motion. Counsel's waiver of a first-degree murder instruction was a reasonable trial strategy and choice given movant's degree of participation in the underlying robbery. Movant did not prove that counsel's failure to call certain witnesses denied her a viable defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought an action against the telegraph company in an attempt to collect a charge on the company's gross receipts. The city contended that the charge was authorized by &sect; 23.32 of the Revised Code of the City of St. Louis. The company filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment. It argued that it was exempt from any charge or tax for use of the city's streets, alleys, or public areas. It also claimed that, as applied, &sect; 23.32 was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed with the company and the city sought review. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that a series of cases from the late 1800's established the company's contractual rights with the city. Those cases, the court said, established that the city was not entitled to charge the company rent. The court rejected the city's claim that the charge was a tax, not a rent, saying that the ordinance's language clearly did not impose a tax. The court also found that the ordinance violated the Equal Protection Clause because it treated telegraph and telephone companies differently and because there was no rational basis for the difference. The court also held that the ordinance violated the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

The trial court specified that summary judgment was granted solely on the basis of the two-year statute of limitations of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that, during an examination more than three years before he filed his petition, the providers were negligent in failing to diagnose the presence of calcified kidney stones in his kidney. He alleged that he did not suffer damage until a kidney stone dislodged from his kidney and obstructed his ureter and left kidney. The court held that the patient's limitation period commenced to run at the time of the physical exam, when the negligent act complained of occurred. Thus, the action was untimely because it was not filed within two years of the date of the exam. The court further found that the patient was not receiving the continued care necessary to toll the statute. The court rejected the patient's claim that the cause of action did not accrue until the kidney stone descended, emphasizing that Missouri had rejected the adoption of a discovery rule for malpractice actions. Section 516.105 was not unconstitutional because the patient was not a minor when the negligent act occurred and the time allowed for commencement of the action was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The victim was drinking in a tavern with defendant and others. The victim left the tavern in a highly intoxicated state. Some distance from the tavern, the victim was attacked, beaten, cut with a knife, and robbed. A witness identified defendant as the assailant. Defendant argued trial court error in the failure to suppress the evidence consisting of bloodstained clothing worn by defendant on the night of the crime. The court held that because the clothing was voluntarily delivered to the police by defendant's wife, the point had no merit. Search without a warrant was valid if done with proper consent voluntarily given. Further, consent of one person who possessed common authority was valid as against the absent nonconsenting person with whom the authority was shared. Defendant was fully informed of his rights and made inculpatory statements without any threats or promises being made. The court was therefore entitled to find that the arrest, even if without probable cause, was not a factor tending to coerce defendant. The court correctly overruled objections to defendant's statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) for manslaughter and the resultant sentence as a prior offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two others agreed to participate in the robbery to obtain a car for a trip. When the victim approached a stop sign, defendant, armed with a gun, ran to the driver side and announced a robbery. The victim resisted and was fatally shot. Defendant was convicted of manslaughter as a prior offender. On appeal, the court held that where a statute was procedural in that it provided what could be utilized as evidence in a trial, it did not change the ingredients of the crime or the ultimate facts necessary to prove the crime or change the consequences of defendant's acts. Thus, a statute's application did not run afoul of the prohibition on ex post facto laws. It was unnecessary for defendant to admit that he made a statement if, from his testimony and other evidence, the fact that such statements were made was established. The court found no error in admission of the co-defendant's taped prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence or in the trial court's sentencing defendant as a prior offender. Defendant was present when the killing occurred and actively participated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city, a mayor's commission on human rights and community relations, four members of the commission, and the complaining employee, sought review of a Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri) decision, which reversed a commission order directing respondent doctor to compensate the employee for discrimination in employment based on religion and for retaliation for having filed a discrimination claim against respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court rejected the merit of appellants' argument that the failure to serve the state's attorney general with a copy of the proceeding should have resulted in the circuit court's judgment being a nullity. The court then found that the commission had erred in determining that the employee's discharge was the result of religious discrimination and retaliation. In an earlier administrative proceeding, the issue had been whether the employee had been discharged for misconduct connected with her work. The appeals referee had determined that the employee was discharged because she had removed a bandage from the foot of a patient after being specifically told, more than once, not to do so, and that the error resulted in additional surgery for the patient. The court further noted that the decision of the appeals referee became final for lack of further administrative or judicial review. In affirming, the court concluded that the rule of collateral estoppel should have barred the employee from claiming that her discharge from employment by respondent was the result of the claimed religious discrimination and retaliation.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the matter to the circuit court with directions to dismiss the insurance company's petition for review for want of jurisdiction. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.100 (1986) defined the conditions for judicial review, which required, in part, a contested case. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36.010(2) (1986) defined a contested case as a proceeding before an agency in which legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties were required by law to be determined after hearing; a case that had to be contested before an administrative agency because of some requirement in a statute, ordinance, municipal charter or constitutional provision for a hearing before it of which a record had to be made unless waived. In the instant case, there was no requirement for a hearing, and thus, the matter before the court on appeal was not a contested case, and was not an appropriate subject for judicial review. The mere fact that the Director permitted a hearing, where none was required, did not make the matter a contested case.</SPAN></P>

The court found that under Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and he appealed. The court found no merit in any of his points of alleged trial error and affirmed the judgment and sentences. The court held that Mo. Rev.

The court held that there was no confrontational violation. The court also found no abuse of discretion in the case. The evidence of the facial scars was competent evidence to show defendant's consciousness of guilt and his attempt to induce false testimony by a witness. There was no proof made by defendant that racial discrimination in the selection of the jury denied him due process and equal protection of the law. The trial court properly overruled defendant's motion to quash the jury panel. The in-court identification was properly received because the witnesses had a substantial basis for their testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a member of the Missouri Bar and held an L.L.M. degree. He appeared pro se throughout the proceeding and pleaded not guilty. He was convicted and, on appeal, he did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, but only contended, in part, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.017, 195.020 and 195.200 violated fundamental rights, due process and equal protection. The court disagreed and affirmed. Defendant did not cite any provision of the U.S. or Missouri Constitutions. The court noted that the Missouri Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.017, and rejected defendant's assertion that &sect; 195.017 was constitutional as applied to a sale of marijuana, while he merely possessed of a small amount of marijuana. Also, because his &quot;suggestions&quot; were not contained in the file and the record did not show what constitutional sections he might have cited, the court held that defendant did not raise the constitutional issue in the trial court; therefore, it was not preserved for appellate review. Moreover, the record did not show that the trial court heard and determined his motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with the receivership, the trial court issued an order relative to disbursement of the funds. In a prior appeal, the stockholder obtained a writ of prohibition directing that the order be vacated and set aside and that the order not be enforced in any way. Following the court's writ, the trustee continued to administer the fund, compensating herself for her services. The IRS later determined that it had no claim for federal taxes against the company or the receiver, therefore, it paid the receiver the funds which had been deposited in escrow. The stockholder never enforced the court's writ. On appeal, the court determined that the stockholder made no attempt to enforce the writ and in fact, continued to recognize the trial court's order as if it were valid and viable. Thus, the court held, the stockholder was not permitted to appeal the order. The court further ruled that it would not consider the merits of the stockholder's appeal because the stockholder had already obtained relief from the trial court's order by way of the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

A police officer conducted a field sobriety test on defendant after he smelled alcohol on defendant's breath. A breathalyzer test revealed that defendant was legally intoxicated. Defendant alleged that the roadblock was unconstitutional per se and that the roadblock as operated was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court concluded that roadblocks were not unconstitutional per se, as roadblocks were permissible if they were designed to stop all traffic and were supported by a valid public interest. The court determined that the State had a legitimate public interest in intercepting and removing drunk drivers from the roadways and that the roadblock was designed to stop all traffic. The court found that the roadblock as operated was not unconstitutional because it was executed according to a plan, there was no random selection of any one vehicle, and supervisory personnel were present to insure proper execution of the plan.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the taxpayers did not have standing to challenge the industrial development authority's use of its funds because those funds were not part of the general revenue. The court also held that the taxpayers lacked standing to challenge the convention board's use of its funds because the convention board was not a public subdivision with the power to tax. The court found that the taxpayers did not have a private right of action under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.011 et seq. (1986). The court held that the industrial development board was not subject to Missouri's Sunshine Law but that the convention board was subject to Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of one count of rape, three counts of sodomy, and one count of sexual abuse in the first degree. Defendant sought review of the trial court's decision, claiming that the trial court erred in admitting testimony as to the victim's out-of-court statements, in permitting rebuttal evidence of his reputation for truth and veracity, and in allowing prosecutorial misconduct. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling, holding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.075, which allowed admission of a child's otherwise inadmissible statements, was not unconstitutional. The court also ruled that the trial court finding's reliability of the statements satisfied &sect; 491.075 and that the statements were not an improper bolstering of in-court testimony. The court held that the trial court's failure to determine the reliability of statements by school officials was harmless error because defendant did not show any resultant prejudice. The court concluded that the state was entitled to present rebuttal testimony as to defendant's bad reputation for truth and veracity and that any alleged incidents of prosecutorial misconduct did not deprive defendant of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced him as a class X offender, which mandated that 80 percent of his sentence be served before he was eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother robbed two victims at gunpoint and shot at one victim who gave chase. When caught, defendant threw a gun out of his car. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court rejected the argument of defendant, who was black, that the prosecutor acted discriminatory in striking black persons from the panel. The prosecutor's challenges were racially neutral when one juror had gone to school with defendant's sister, one had a son in prison, and two failed to initially respond to the general question of whether they or anyone close to them had ever been arrested or convicted. That these two jurors were not frank until directly questioned individually provided a reasonable, racially neutral basis for the prosecutor's decision to strike them because they &quot;had not been truthful&quot; in their answers. However, the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant concealed the gun because the officer was not close enough to see whether the gun had been in plain view in the car. Moreover, the trial court erred by adjudicating defendant as a class X offender because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019 (1986) was not effective until after he committed the crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor owned and operated a hotel, and the lessor entered into a lease with the lessees for the operation of a restaurant within the hotel. Under the lease, the lessees were obligated to pay rent and to obtain liability insurance. There was a cure period on notice of certain lease violations, but no cure period was required for a failure to pay rent. The lessor sent a notice of default with respect to the insurance coverage, and then sent a notice of termination and demand for possession. The lessor instituted an unlawful detainer action, and the lessees filed a counterclaim. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim and entered summary judgment for the lessor. The lessees appealed but did not file a supersedeas bond. The lessor's motion to dismiss the appeal was denied because no bond was needed, and the trial court's judgment was modified and affirmed. The court held that all exhibits were properly admitted and properly considered, and there were no genuine issues of material fact. However, the trial court erred in its calculation of double damages under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 534.330 (1986), so that portion of the trial court's order awarding damages was reduced.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued numerous errors. The court affirmed the conviction. Specifically, the court held that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 562.021.3 (1986), it was not error for the trial court to submit an instruction of involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of second-degree murder because under the statute, when recklessness sufficed to establish a culpable mental state, it was also established if a person acted purposely or knowingly. Furthermore, the court found that it was not error to permit defendant's wife to testify as a State's witness where she unequivocally stated that she wanted to testify. In addition, the court held that the testimony of defendant's babysitter that defendant suspected that his wife was sleeping with the victim was properly admitted because the testimony was relevant to show defendant's motive for shooting the victim. Finally, the court found that the fact that defendant was nervous when he submitted his confession to the police failed to demonstrate that the confession was not the product of his own free will.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, and he challenged that judgment. Defendant argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.074 (1986), which allowed prior inconsistent statements of witnesses to be admitted in certain cases, was unconstitutional. The court determined that defendant had not made a constitutional claim at trial. The first time defendant presented constitutional objections was in his brief on appeal. Since defendant's constitutional challenge was not directed to the statute under which he was charged, the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court was not under attack. The court held that absent a showing of plain error, defendant's failure to raise the constitutional objection in his motion for new trial resulted in the point not being preserved for appeal. The court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by the State's questions during the punishment phase. Thus, if error, the questions were harmless. Further, the court found that an affidavit for a search warrant was sufficient because corroborating evidence was uncovered and included in the affidavit, which verified the information given by the informants.</SPAN></P>

The Missouri Supreme Court had denied direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that the circuit court erred in denying his motion; in applying an unconstitutional interpretation of the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Mo.

The court found that because the aggravating circumstances instruction was approved by the state supreme court on direct appeal, it could not be re-litigated, even on a different theory, in a post-conviction proceeding under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26. The court found no reasonable probability of different results regarding the failure of defendant's trial counsel to file a motion to suppress his statements or his videotaped confession and concluded that the circuit court did not err in denying an evidentiary hearing as to counsel's ineffective assistance. The court held that no hearing was merited, that defendant failed to overcome the presumption of the propriety of his counsel's conduct, and that the lack of a hearing did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

Among the court's conclusions was its finding that because defendant failed to object to the introduction into evidence of the articles found in his apartment during his arrest when they were identified and described by the witnesses, he failed to preserve the error for appellate review. He failed to sustain his constitutional challenge to the jury panel because he failed show: (1) that the group alleged to be excluded was a distinctive class in the community, (2) that the representation of this class in the venire failed to fairly and reasonably relate to their numbers in the community, and, (3) that this under-representation was due to systematic exclusion of the class in the jury selection process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to two years' imprisonment plus a $ 2000 fine. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in allowing the victim's prior statements into evidence and in refusing defendant's proffered instruction regarding the use of prior inconsistent statements. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the trial court erred in admitting the prior statements of the victim. However, the court held that such error was harmless because the evidence was cumulative to the other testimony, which had been properly admitted and proved the issue. The court ruled that defendant waived his entitlement to the instruction because the inconsistent statements of the young victim were introduced during her cross-examination, and subsequent statements sought to be introduced were not inconsistent with the victim's trial testimony. The court also held that if the victim's pre-trial statements were inconsistent with her trial testimony, they were admissible as substantive evidence of their contents under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.074.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also taxed costs against the Director.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1977, the trial court issued a declaratory judgment in favor of the manufacturer, stating that the manufacturer's materials used in its smelting processes were exempt from taxation under a then applicable statute and enjoining the Director from assessing sales and use taxes against the manufacturer. In 1987, after the Director indicated that he would assess sales and use taxes on the manufacturer's reagent purchases, the manufacturer filed a petition for further relief, claiming that the 1977 declaratory judgment established that the reagents used by the manufacturer were also exempt from taxation. The trial court found in favor of the manufacturer. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment enjoining the Director's assessment of such taxes. The declaratory judgment obtained in 1977, 10 years before the Director's assessments, established that the reagents purchased by the manufacturer were exempt from sales tax. There was no need for the manufacturer to obtain a new determination of the issues resolved by the 1977 judgment because neither the applicable law nor the controlling facts had changed in the intervening 10 years.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer had both a concession agreement and a ground lease with the city.

Three months later, ignoring the statutory requirements for appealing the tax assessment, the taxpayer filed a petition to recover the protested tax in the lower court. The county assessor filed an answer, and the taxpayer filed a motion for summary judgment. The lower court denied the motion and the county assessor filed a motion to dismiss. The lower court sustained the motion and the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed and held that the taxpayer, thinking that it had an alternative way to proceed to protest and appeal from the unlawful assessment of its property, ignored all of the statutory requirements for asserting its rights. The court found that the taxpayer's remedy under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031 was fair, adequate, and exclusive. The court noted that the taxpayer's failure to comply with Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted a section in its home rule charter that required tax exemptions for the city's citizens from the county's road and poor tax and required payments from the county to the city for any expenditures made on roads and bridges outside the city limits. On review of the trial court's determination that the section was unconstitutional, the court found that the city did not have standing to contest the tax on behalf of its citizens where the declaratory complaint at issue was not brought on their behalf. Thus, the county's motion to dismiss filed in the trial court should have been granted. Further, the court found that the city did have standing on the proportionate payment issue. However, the trial court erred in finding that portion of the section unconstitutional by entering judgment on the county's motion to dismiss instead of denying the motion to dismiss and entering judgment on the merits of the declaratory judgment action filed by the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery and armed criminal action. Because defendant had two prior robbery conviction and two prior burglary convictions, the trial court concluded that defendant was a class X offender under Mo. Rev.

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a showing that defendant used a deadly weapon during the robbery. Although the gun was not recovered, the victims testified regarding defendant's use of the firearm, and there was no requirement that the State establish that the gun possessed by defendant was actually operative as a firearm. In vacating defendant's sentence, however, the court concluded that, because the new statute, while not increasing the sentence received, increased the minimum time defendant was required to serve before becoming eligible for parole, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019, as applied to defendant, ran afoul of the ex post facto clause and worked a manifest injustice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant liquor license holder challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Missouri) that dismissed the petition for review of the license renewal denial. The liquor license holder contended that Arnold, Mo., Ordinance No. 4.2, &sect; 3-44.1 (1979) was unconstitutional and that police reports improperly were admitted. The appeal was brought against respondents, the mayor, the city clerk, and the city council members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council members unanimously voted against renewal of the liquor license based on the liquor license holder's failure to keep an orderly place of business. The circuit court affirmed the decision, and the liquor license holder appealed the judgment. The court upheld the ruling,applying the standard of review for a &quot;non-contested&quot; case under the Missouri Administrative Procedure and Review Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150. The court found that the city council's failure to renew the license was not arbitrary or capricious, was not an abuse of discretion, and was not based upon an ordinance which was constitutionally infirm. The liquor license holder was the owner or a lounge that was the site of dozens of police incidents each year, some of which were violent and involved dangerous weapons. The court rejected the liquor license holder's claim that Arnold, Mo., Ordinance No. 4.2, &sect; 3-44.1 (1979) was invalid because it granted unlimited discretion to the city council to issue or deny liquor licenses and was subject to arbitrary enforcement. The court also held that the police reports properly were admitted into evidence; they did not constitute hearsay.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat.  &sect; 327.441. A committee, after a hearing, found that the certificates were subject to discipline and remanded the action for assessment of the appropriate action. The board ordered the certificates revoked. Upon appeal, the trial court (Missouri) affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The engineers argued that the statute utilized to revoke their certificates, specifically, Mo. Rev. Stat.  &sect; 327.441.2(5), was impermissibly vague in that it used the term &quot;gross negligence&quot; without defining it. The trial court struck that allegation on the basis that the constitutional issue had not been raised at the first opportunity before the commission. On appeal, the court found that the engineers were not required to raise that issue before the commission because the commission had no authority to decide the constitutionality of the statute. Therefore, the issue had not been waived. But the court found that the use of the term &quot;gross negligence&quot; did not make the statute unconstitutionally vague and that the board properly applied the statute. Additionally, the court affirmed the board's findings concerning the engineers' negligence and revocation of the certificates, with the exception of one finding regarding the design of a particular atrium. That finding was reversed because it was not charged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident victim filed suit, alleging he was injured when a vehicle driven by the city's employee struck his vehicle. The city filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the accident victim failed to give timely notice as required by Springfield, Mo., Charter &sect; 19.10. The trial court dismissed the accident victim's suit. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the notice provisions of a charter which impeded the fundamental right of a citizen to seek redress for injuries resulting from negligent conduct by the city was in direct and irreconcilable conflict with a statute. Springfield, Mo., Charter &sect; 19.10 was in conflict with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82.210 because Springfield, Mo., Charter &sect; 19.10 required serving notice on a the city manager rather than the mayor, as required by the statute, and because it imposed the more onerous duty of giving notice in all negligence cases. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 19.10 prevailed over Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82.210; although Springfield, Mo., &sect; 19.10 was enacted first in time, Mo. Const. art.

The court affirmed, holding that although the trial court erred when it used an incorrect verdict-director, where the definition of robbery utilized did not include all of the elements of robbery in the first degree, the error did not prejudice defendant. Because the jury had no factual issue to resolve as to whether defendant knew his co-defendant was armed, defendant sustained no prejudice as provided by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 28.02(e). Likewise, defendant was not prejudiced by the erroneous verdict-directing instruction in the armed criminal action count. Because the concept of defendant's &quot;encouragement&quot; was not submitted to the jury, the court was unable to find any prejudice to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A female child testified that defendant made her perform oral sex on him. A jury found defendant guilty of sodomy. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 years. The trial court denied defendant's motion for new trial or judgment of acquittal, which had alleged the child was not a competent witness. On appeal, the court affirmed. The testimony of the child was sufficient to establish defendant's guilt. The child was 10 years of age at the time she testified. The presumptive incompetency created by former Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.060 (1978) was therefore not wholly applicable to her. Defendant was in no position to complain that the trial court should have conducted a preliminary examination out of the presence of the jury to determine the child's competency. He interposed no objection to the procedure followed. By her response to the State's questions on voir dire, the child demonstrated sufficient mental capacity to observe an event and later truthfully and accurately relate what, in fact, was done to her. There was no abuse of discretion in permitting the child to testify. The child's recantation of the accusation prior to trial did not prevent her evidence from being substantial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the lender in the unlawful detainer action, and the borrower appealed. The court dismissed the borrower's appeal, finding that the appeal bond required by Mo. Rev.

The court rejected the borrower's contention that the court had jurisdiction because &sect; 534.380 had been declared unconstitutional, finding that the cases cited only applied to tenants out of possession.

Because the cases reached the circuit court, the tenants were entitled to trial by a jury.

The court ruled that defendant's due process rights were not violated by the trial court's decision to permit the victim to testify without a demonstration of competency. The court noted that this precise issue had been decided previously by the Missouri Supreme Court. The court also ruled that there was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant committed the rape despite the fact that the ultimate source was the testimony of the four-year-old victim. The court noted that while the victim's testimony was not corroborated, it was neither doubtful nor contradictory. The court also ruled that plain error was not committed by the trial court in permitting statements made by the victim to a neighbor and to her grandmother to be admitted into evidence, where an injustice or a miscarriage of justice did not result by the admission of the statements into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri of two counts of promoting pornography in the second degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.030 (1978) (later replaced). The main issue on appeal was whether the court had jurisdiction to decide the issue raised by defendant, i.e., that the definition of &quot;pornographic&quot; in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.010(1) (1978) (later replaced), as applied in &sect; 573.030, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court began by noting that the version of &sect; 573.010(1) on which defendant's conviction was based called for the application of community standards to the question of whether the magazines defendant sold to a police officer, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, the third part of the test established by a United States Supreme Court case for determining whether material was obscene. However, a later Supreme Court decision had rejected the community standards test replacing it with a &quot;reasonable person&quot; test. The court noted that it could not remand to the trial court for a determination of whether defendant's conviction based on &sect; 573.010(1) was harmless error. To do so would require the court to review for error, which would require an examination of the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 573.010(1) and 573.030. The court did not have jurisdiction to do so. Given the court's conclusion that defendant's constitutional challenge was real and substantial, and not merely colorable, Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 vested the Supreme Court of Missouri with exclusive appellate jurisdiction as to the validity of &sect;&sect; 573.010(1) and 573.030.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the case be transferred to the Supreme Court of Missouri.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant alleged Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.074, which allowed prior inconsistent statements of witnesses to be admitted in certain cases, was unconstitutional. Appellant also argued the trial court erred in the punishment phase by permitting the State to question appellant concerning an irrelevant relationship and statements which tended to inflame and prejudice the jury. In his two other contentions, appellant asserted the search warrant issued in the case was invalid and the trial court submitted erroneous verdict directing instructions. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence because there was no manifest injustice in admitting the prior inconsistent statements pursuant to &sect; 491.074, the trial court was without power to reduce punishment below the minimum for first degree murder and thus, appellant was not prejudiced by the State's questions during the punishment phase, the affidavit supporting the application for a warrant was sufficient, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, in the instructions given to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant pleaded guilty to selling a controlled substance and was sentenced to five years. He served six months in prison and was then placed on probation. Subsequently, his probation was revoked and he was returned to prison. In May 1985, he was paroled again after two years and six months. In April 1986, his parole was revoked again and he was incarcerated. Movant filed a pro se motion, pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26, protesting the board of probation and parole's refusal to credit him for the period that he was on parole from May 1985 to April 1986. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, movant argued that his imprisonment was unconstitutional and that because the statute relied upon by the board of probation and parole, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.221 (1978), was not in effect at the time he entered his guilty plea, its application to him violated ex post facto laws. The court held that habeas corpus was the proper remedy to test the legality of movant's incarceration. The court held that the judgment of the trial court was not clearly erroneous, and it declined to review the motion as an application for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By indictment defendant was charged with kidnapping, forcible rape, and two counts of sodomy. A young female was the victim of all the offenses charged. Defendant finally struck a plea bargain with the State. The docket entry reflect that defendant asked leave to withdraw his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to kidnapping and forcible rape. Defendant was again asked if he was prepared to plead guilty to kidnapping and forcible rape. He answered affirmatively. The court explained defendant's right to a trial and asked if his plea was voluntary on his part and answered affirmatively. The lower court then accepted the two pleas of guilty and found there was a factual basis for the pleas. Defendant then filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. 27.26 which was denied. Defendant's major assertions on appeal were that he was denied effective assistance of counsel before his plea and his plea of guilty should not have been accepted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A former employee filed a complaint against the employer, and the commission determined that the employer failed to make reasonable accommodations for the employee's disability. The commission ordered the employer to pay the employee back wages and to reinstate the employee. In its petition, the employer sought reversal of the commission's decision, an order enjoining its enforcement, and a declaration that &sect;&sect; 18A-1 through 18A-30 were unconstitutional. Neither the city nor the state attorney general were made parties to the proceedings as required by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 87.04. The circuit court found that the delegation by the city council of the power to hear and determine violations of municipal ordinances and to devise remedies violated the Home Rule Charter and was inconsistent with the Missouri Constitution. On appeal the court found that the circuit court proceeding involved the validity of the ordinances. Rule 87.04 required that the city be made a party with the right to be heard in proceedings that challenged the validity of an ordinance. The city was an indispensable party and the failure to join it as a party required a reversal of the circuit court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent bank brought an action in replevin, coupled with a claim for damages, against appellant debtors. The debtors field counterclaims for the unreasonable disposition of the property seized by the bank. The Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri), entered judgment in favor of the bank on its replevin claims and directed a verdict for the bank on the debtors' counterclaims. The debtors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors claimed that the trial court erred in submitting the replevin count to the jury because there was no payment default entitling the bank to seize the collateral. In addition, the debtors claimed that the trial court erred by entering a directed verdict for the bank on their counterclaim for emotional distress, that Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 99 was unconstitutional, and that the bank's holding company was liable for the bank's acts under an agency theory. On appeal, the court held that it was reversible error for the trial court to admit extrinsic evidence of a prior loan agreement to add to the terms of the parties' extension agreements. In addition, the court held that the bank failed to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 400.0-504(3) and thus was barred from seeking to recover any deficiency. Regarding the counterclaims, the court held that the facts alleged did not give rise to a justiciable cause of action in damages for non-monetary losses, that Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 99 was constitutional, and that the holding company was entitled to a directed verdict in its favor because there was no evidence of its pervasive involvement in the bank's affairs.</SPAN></P>

His convictions for robbery in the first degree and armed criminal action and his sentences of 25 years of imprisonment on the first charge and 20 years on the second had been affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant's pro se motion was timely. A public defender was appointed to represent him and appeared at a hearing on the motion, where movant was given a continuance to study the transcript and file a possible amended motion. The motion court issued an order requiring the amended motion to be filed by a certain date. On that date, movant's public defender filed a motion to disqualify the trial judge, did not file an amended motion, and sought a continuance. The motion court denied the motions for disqualification and for a continuance. The court affirmed the judgment. Movant's counsel was given a reasonable opportunity to amend his pro se motion. She received notice of and an opportunity to be heard on the motion court's intention to rule on the motion, and no amended motion was required if the pro se motion adequately stated movant's grounds for relief. The court held that inadequacy of counsel on a motion pursuant to Rule 27.26 was not to be challenged in the appeal of such a motion. Movant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because his claims were conclusory, were based on misstatements of the law, or were not reviewable under Rule 27.26.</SPAN></P>

The court held that clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported the trial court's determination that conditions of a potentially harmful nature continued to exist.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) denying relief in a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 proceeding. Defendant had sought relief from the conviction and sentence for the charge of capital murder. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on direct appeal, finding there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of deliberation and premeditation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision denying relief in a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 proceeding, the court affirmed. The court held that the subject matter of a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 proceeding was limited by the rule to a determination of whether defendant's original trial was violative of any constitutional requirements or if the judgment was otherwise void. It was not the proper vehicle for the relitigation of a defendant's guilt or innocence. Defendant argued that the motion court failed to consider a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that the difficulty with this contention was that the motion did not allege any acts or failures to act by trial counsel amounting to ineffective assistance. Where the motion did not allege facts from which ineffective assistance of defense counsel could be found, if proven, the issue was not before the motion court. Further, the motion court correctly found that constitutionality of a criminal statute, if preserved, was a matter for direct appeal. So also was a matter of the sufficiency of the evidence. Here, that issue was raised and decided on direct appeal. The sufficiency of instructions was also a matter for direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

A jury found him guilty and the Circuit Court of Jasper County (Missouri) found defendant was a persistent sexual offender and sentenced him to imprisonment for 50 years without probation or parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant presented six points on appeal. The court affirmed and held that the trial court, with caution, determined the relevance of the testimony of certain details of defendant's previous conviction of sodomy upon the victim, and thus did not abuse its discretion in allowing its admission. The identification of a baby sitter as the victim of another offense was not error. A determination that an isolated reference to an act the jury had twice heard described did not call for a mistrial was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion. The court found that defendant's punishment was not grossly disproportionate to the offense and was not such as to shock the moral sense of all reasonable men as to what was right and proper under the circumstances. Under the circumstances, the trial judge's acceptance of an earlier plea did not demand his self-disqualification. Defendant's belated argument of unconstitutionality did not remove the case from the jurisdiction of the court. Lastly, the evidence established that the victim's statement given to an officer was reliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was shot in defendant's residence. Defendant first told police that he heard a noise upon returning to the residence and then found the victim in a closet. He thereafter told the police that when he returned he reached for the gun in her hand, and it discharged. He later told the police a third version in which he had struggled with the victim after striking her. There was evidence that defendant was a violent person and had beaten the victim previously. The court ruled that the facts and circumstances were more than sufficient for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had knowingly caused the death of the victim by shooting her. The court rejected the argument that the pistol had been unconstitutionally recovered. The court ruled that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area where the pistol had been found. He was the one that had told the police that the victim was shot with his pistol and that she had hidden the pistol in the closet where it was discovered. By doing this, defendant waived any right to privacy that he might have had for the closet area and gave his implied consent to the search for the pistol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual and his wife were awarded judgment after the individual was injured due to faulty crutches. The retailer filed a third-party petition against the manufacturer that sought indemnity in the event the retailer was held liable, which it was. The manufacturer claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over it. The manufacturer appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the manufacturer had delivered its crutches into the stream of commerce and availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the state and, therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction over the manufacturer. The court held that apportionment based on indemnity was appropriate by the retailer, and could be pleaded at any time during the pendency of the action. The court stated that a cause of action for indemnity was supported against the manufacturer of the crutches because the retailer had no knowledge of the defect. The court found that the trial court had not erred in denying a witness for the manufacturer from testifying about the fact that he had no knowledge of any prior incidents involving the crutches. The court stated that such evidence was not admissible.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 211.351.1 and 211.447.1 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants had abandoned their three children for at least one year. In proceedings to terminate their parental rights, one of the judges who was involved in the preliminary stages of the juvenile proceeding also sat for the hearing to terminate and ordered termination. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the fact that the trial judge was involved in the preliminary proceedings did not ipso facto disqualify him from presiding at the termination proceeding because the trial judge's limited supervisory control over the case did not disqualify him from presiding at subsequent hearings. The court found that appellants did not claim that the trial judge had any personal bias or that appellants received unfair treatment. The court also held that a judicial officer appointed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 211.351.1 and 211.447.1 was not unconstitutional. The court further held that the evidence established a year's abandonment because appellants moved away, did not contact the authorities, and had no contact with the children during the period from August 1984 to August 1985.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) that affirmed the determination of respondent, Board of Police Commissioners, suspending him without pay for three violations of the St. Louis, Mo., Police Department Rule &sect; 7.011 arising from an incident in which the police officer was arrested for operating a motor vehicle in an intoxicated condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer argued that it was error to deny his application for change of judge, that the Board's order was unsupported by substantial and competent evidence, and that the Police Manual Rules were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision, finding that the police officer's application for change of judge failed to comply with Mo. R. Civ. P. 51.05 and, as such was properly denied. The court found that the evidence presented against the police officer was not inadmissible hearsay, explaining that the evidence qualified as a past recollection recorded because the arresting officer relied upon his independent recollection during his testimony. The court opined that St. Louis, Mo., Police Department Rule 7.011 was not so vague or imprecise that it failed to provide the police officer with reasonable notice of the proscribed conduct. The court reasoned that it was impossible for the Police Manual to precisely prescribe every affirmative duty and proscribe every act of misconduct for the myriad of factual situations that were presented to the police officer.</SPAN></P>

Settlements were reached by the collector's agreement to disburse the contested funds to the school districts after each district agreed that the collector could withhold from future revenues due the district any amount ultimately held to be owed to the taxpayers. Affirming the trial court judgments, the court held that: (1) disbursements were subject to the trial courts' determinations that the taxing authority had the ability to repay the impounded tax funds if a refund was later made; (2) because the taxpayers' interests were not subject to being extinguished, they were not entitled to intervene or join the suit under S. Ct. Rule 52.04(a); (3) the taxpayers' interests were adequately represented by existing parties under S. Ct. Rule 52.12(a); and (4) an action under Mo. Rev.

The Commission found that respondents had caused pollution of the waters of the State of Missouri or placed, caused, or permitted to be placed a water contaminant in locations where it was reasonably certain to cause pollution of waters of the State of Missouri.The court stated that before a developer could commence construction on any lot within a new development, or sell, rent, or lease any lot, he had to first submit to DNR a report prepared by an engineer, outlining his plans for the disposal of waste water. The developer had to obtain the written approval of the plan from DNR and comply with all conditions and requirements set forth in writing by DNR before the development could proceed.

The conviction, a result of trial by jury, was affirmed on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant first filed a pro se motion, which contained numerous obfuscatory averments. At movant's request, the motion court appointed counsel to represent him. Movant's counsel filed an amended motion, incorporating movant's pro se motion by reference and adding one new ground for relief. Among the assertions in movant's pro se motion was an ineffective assistance of counsel allegation. Movant asserted that the motion court erred in denying his motion without granting an evidentiary hearing. The court reversed the motion court's decision. It noted that to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of ineffectiveness of counsel, a prisoner seeking post-conviction relief was required to plead facts, not conclusions, which if true would warrant relief. However, the motion court only ruled that the records contained no grounds for movant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Rule 27.26 provided that the motion court should make findings of fact and conclusions of law on all issues presented, whether or not a hearing was held. A mere recital or statement that the records showed that the prisoner was entitled to no relief did not constitute compliance with Rule 27.26.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant agreed, with certain co-conspirators, to raise money in order to purchase marijuana offered for sale by an undercover police officer.

On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court's judgment was supported by sufficient evidence. The court determined that Missouri had adopted the unilateral theory of conspiracy in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.016.1 (1978), which provided that a person was guilty of conspiracy to commit an offense if, with the purpose of promoting its commission he agreed with another person that one or more of them will engage in conduct which constituted the offense. The court found the circumstantial evidence that the marijuana was being purchased for resale to be sufficient. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting recordings of conversations between defendant's co-conspirators and police, even though defendant was not present.

Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err when it failed to strike, for cause, a venireperson who recognized the name of a police officer witness and said that she believed that the police would not lie, but could be mistaken as to the facts. It was not reversible error to fail to strike for cause a venire member who initially expressed a tendency to believe a police officer's testimony, but who later indicated an ability to evaluate all testimony by the same standard. The venireperson understood that the State had the burden of proving a defendant's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The exclusion of venire members whose consciences were shocked by the harshness of marijuana penalties so that they were unable to follow the law did not deny defendant his right to a fair and impartial jury. Defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that persons who had been arrested or knew others who had been arrested were a distinct class subject to unconstitutional underrepresentation and systematically excluded from jury panels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners owned a three-acre lot in an area in which the town and county zoning code required that all parcels be three acres in size. The property owners petitioned for a variance to permit them to subdivide their land into two separate lots, one consisting of two acres and the second consisting of one acre. The board of adjustment denied their petition, and the property owners sought judicial review. After the circuit court affirmed the ruling of the board of adjustment, the property owners appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the board of adjustment did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested zoning variance. The granting of a variance was only proper where there were practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that precluded compliance with the zoning laws. The property owners failed to show that their inability to subdivide their property created an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty. The property owners were currently using the property for residential purposes, and they could continue to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment that the Jackson County Circuit Court (Missouri), entered in favor of the State of Missouri, denying defendant's alternative application under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.040 (1984) for conditional or unconditional release from the care, custody, and control of the Missouri Director of Mental Diseases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's acquittal of second degree murder by reason of mental disease or defect led to his commitment. Defendant later filed the instant action, during the pendency of which the governing statute was amended so that the burden of persuasion varied depending upon whether the relief sought was conditional or unconditional release. After the State prevailed at trial, defendant appealed to no effect. The testimony of defendant's two experts was neither credible nor persuasive. The trial court did not err in considering the transcript of judicial proceedings in which defendant was involved in another court. Neither of the burdens of persuasion in the amended statute applied to defendant's case. That the amended statute was procedural and therefore to be retroactively applied was irrelevant because the pleading and evidentiary portions of the proceeding were concluded before the effective date of the amended statute. Thus, the burden of persuasion in the unconditional release application remained unchanged. On the facts, the burden of persuasion in defendant's application for conditional release was irrelevant because the trial court lacked jurisdiction over such actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of aldermen of respondent city, acting as a board of impeachment, voted to remove appellant mayor. The circuit court reviewed the proceedings in accordance with the Missouri Administrative Procedure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 536, affirmed the action, and dissolved a temporary restraining order. After initial appeal by the mayor, the Supreme Court of Missouri remanded the case. The mayor complained of bias regarding two board members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the beginning of the hearing, the mayor filed a motion for disqualification of two members of the board, one of whom presided over the hearing and later became acting mayor. He alleged financial interest and prejudgment. The mayor attempted to develop a record by questioning the two challenged members. The board summarily denied the motion, and made no finding of fact as to whether either or both of the members were biased and should have been disqualified. The court ruled that the mayor's opportunity to present evidence bearing on the issue of bias was not reasonable as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.063(3) (1978). The court explained that the disqualification issues were serious enough to be heard, even if it was later decided that they were not enough to compel disqualification. Rejecting application of the rule of necessity, the court said that the disqualification would not have destroyed the board's ability to decide. It still would have been fundamentally capable of impeachment. The possibility of disqualification of two members and the mayor's lone supporter still voting against impeachment so that impeachment was defeated did not require a change in the holding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the board and remanded. The court ordered the mayor returned to office. The court added that if after remand it was decided to proceed with a new impeachment hearing, the board would have conducted its proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city employees sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which entered judgment denying all relief requested by the employees in their suit against respondents, a city, its officials, and various health care corporations, to enjoin the performance of contracts under which the corporations were to provide health care services to replace those offered by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees, who were also city residents and taxpayers, all had appeals pending before the city's Civil Service Commission to contest their layoffs. Their suit requested a declaration of the parties' rights and obligations under the city's charter with damages for the threatened deprivation of their rights as taxpayers and their property rights in their jobs, as well as an injunction with attorney's fees and costs, but no damages. One corporation argued that the employees lacked standing, and the trial court found that the contracts resulted in improved health care for city residents, improved facilities without a substantial capital investment by the city, and many millions of dollars in future savings. On review, the court found that the employees lacked standing as such because the employment issues were committed to the Commission's jurisdiction, and that they lacked standing as taxpayers because they failed to allege facts showing an increased tax burden where the evidence showed that the contract actually saved the city money.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the trial court's decision with instructions to vacate the judgment and dismiss the cause.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 537.080 (1978), for the death of her father. The minor's father underwent elective surgery and died from complications more than five years before the minor brought suit. She was 13 years old when she brought the wrongful death action. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the suit was time barred under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.100 (Supp. 1984). The trial court granted defendant's motion and the minor appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that statute of limitations that applied to wrongful death actions was constitutional as it applied to the minor's claims. The court noted that filing within the statute of limitations was a necessary condition to the right to sue for wrongful death, and not merely a statute of limitations in the ordinary sense. The court further noted that the minor's mother could have brought suit in or own name or on behalf of the minor within the statutory period, and the record did not suggest otherwise.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded that: (1) the jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of manslaughter was proper because under the law at the time of crime, manslaughter did not require mens rea; (2) it lacked the power to review defendant's claim that certain approved jury instructions were improper as only the Missouri Supreme Court had that power; (3) defendant was not prejudiced by the disposal of the victim's knife as the evidence did not support his claim of self-defense; and (5) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial based on defendant's allegation that he was incompetent to waive his rights to proceed pro se and to testify because was semi-comatose during portions of the trial due to a diabetic reaction as defendant failed to prove he had insufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer and no rational understanding of the proceedings against him.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the stipulated facts supported and were not contrary to the trial court's findings. The court rejected the development company's claim that the city exceeded its authority when it adopted an ordinance regulating lake activity, holding that Mo. Rev.

The victim suffered a deep puncture wound, but was able to give police a good description of defendant, who was arrested a short time after the attack. Defendant was convicted of assaulting the victim and sought review, arguing that at trial, the victim's serious physical injury, as defined by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.060 (1986) was not proven, that the prosecution committed misconduct in failing to turn over discoverable material to defendant prior to trial, and that the trial court erroneously excluded several jury members. The court found that the existence of the victim's facial scar many months after the incident was sufficient to prove her injury, that the material sought by defendant was not suppressed by the prosecution, and that defendant failed to show that the exclusion of the jurors in question was systematic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant was convicted for murder in the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. The conviction was affirmed on appeal and movant subsequently filed a motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26. Movant contended that he was denied a fair trial because his jury did not represent a complete cross-section of the county residents. Movant also argued that his counsel was ineffective because he did not object to the jury selection process, and did not assert a defense of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility. The trial court denied the motion and movant appealed. The court affirmed and held that movant failed to allege that he did not know of the improper jury selection process prior to trial or that it resulted in the prejudice of any of his legal rights. The court held that because movant failed to show a denial of any right or prejudice, his allegations were without merit. The court also found that movant's mental condition was examined and his attorney concluded that no defense existed on the basis of mental disease or defect. Therefore, movant's allegations were insufficient to establish the existence of such a defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board of police commissioners appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of the County of St. Louis (Missouri), which reversed the board's decision ordering that a written reprimand be placed in the personnel file of plaintiff police captain. The board found that the captain violated police department regulations by spending vending machine revenue inappropriately and by giving ledgers to a person outside the department for auditing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the captain was given authority to implement a team policing program, of which the primary goals were increased community involvement and greater job satisfaction, the captain expanded the uses of the vending machine proceeds but restricted disbursements so that they complied with a special order limiting the use of the revenue for the benefit of members within the district. Before a shortage in the vending machine fund was discovered, the captain's superiors were apprised of all the disbursements and did not question the captain about the propriety of the expenditures. The court held that no substantial evidence supported the board's conclusion that the captain's use of the fund proceeds violated his responsibilities as a commander of a police district. The court determined that the captain's action in giving the fund records to a bookkeeper who was not a member of the department did not constitute neglect of duty because the captain's bookkeeping techniques were acceptable throughout the department, and the department never gave the captain direction on how to enhance the accuracy of his record keeping.</SPAN></P>

A police officer found defendant at a hospital emergency room, as defendant had taken the victim there. The officer took defendant to the police station. There he made damaging admissions, which he claimed should have been excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree. As for his second argument on appeal, he objected to the involuntary manslaughter jury instruction, arguing that there was insufficient evidence that he caused the victim's death while he was under the influence of sudden passion. The court rejected both and affirmed. As to the first, the arresting officer knew through the police dispatch that defendant was connected with the shooting. This, along with statements made at the hospital, was sufficient to constitute probable cause to arrest him. His subsequent statements were not the fruit of an illegal arrest. Second, defendant argued that the victim's action of slapping him was insufficient to establish &quot;sudden passion;&quot; his actions were allegedly self-defense. The court found that the jury instructions defined the terms &quot;sudden passion&quot; and &quot;adequate cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the facts of whether the accident arose out of and in the course of employment were not in dispute, and where the question was a matter of law, the commission's decision was not binding on the court. The decedent was not engaged in work on the premises where she normally performed her duties, nor had her services required her presence at the railroad crossing where she was injured because she was on her way home. The facts of the accident had not brought it within the exception to the general rule, which applied when there was an extension of an employer's premises to include the place of an accident that happened away from the premises. At the crossing where the accident occurred, the railroad tracks were not adjacent or contiguous to the employer's premises but were approximately 350 feet away. The employer had no business with the railroad, nor had it exercised any control over the public grade crossing. The place of the accident was a public road, over which the city and the railroad, but not the employer, had control and responsibility. The hazards of the crossing used by the general public were typical of those at any similar railroad crossing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's prosecutor sought to step down and not prosecute an arson case because the accused was a son of a county official and the prosecutor argued that he was interested in the case and that such interest was inconsistent with the duties of his office.

The county had the burden to affirmatively establish that the award was a manifest abuse of discretion.

The trial court dismissed the informations on the grounds that the presumption contained in St. Louis, Mo., Revised Ordinance &sect; 706.100 eliminated the knowledge element. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. First, the court determined that it had jurisdiction over the appeal because a violation of an ordinance was considered civil in nature. Under Mo. Rev.

Next, the court determined that St. Louis, Mo., Revised Ordinance &sect; 706.100.1 did eliminate the element knowledge or at least removed the prosecutor's burden. However, the court held that &sect; 706.100.1 was severable from the rest of the ordinance and that the valid sections standing alone were not incompetent and incapable of being executed. Because St. Louis, Mo., Revised Ordinance &sect; 706.070 made no mention of St. Louis, Mo., Revised Ordinance &sect; 706.100.1, the knowledge element remained in tact in St. Louis, Mo., Revised Ordinance &sect; 607.070.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator father brought an action for an original writ of prohibition seeking to prohibit respondent judge from making a custody and visitation order regarding the father and his minor son.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After giving birth to the couple's child, the father's wife developed an infection and became comatose. She was found totally incapacitated. The wife's guardian ad litem, who was also appointed conservator, filed a motion in the probate court on behalf of the wife seeking temporary custody of and visitation with the child. The father moved to dismiss the motion and filed the instant petition, seeking to prohibit the probate court from ruling on the conservator's motion, arguing that the probate court lacked jurisdiction. The court quashed the preliminary writ. Although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 472.020 (1984), which governed the jurisdiction of the probate division of the circuit, did not specifically include custody and visitation matters, its grant of jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to &quot;probate business&quot; was broad enough to include the granting of temporary custody and visitation rights in an incapacity proceeding. In such a proceeding, the probate court was bound by the best interests of the child standard. The court also held that the father was given sufficient notice of the proceedings and that there was no requirement that a guardian ad litem be appointed for the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that evidentiary, procedural, and sentencing error entitled him to relief. The State prevailed. The search warrant executed against defendant was sufficiently particular in its description of the place to be searched because: (1) the officer executing the warrant could, with reasonable effort, ascertain and identify the place intended to be searched; and (2) there was not any reasonable probability that another premise might be mistakenly searched. To that end, the court noted that warrants directing the search of property in rural areas did not require the same degree of particularity used in urban ones. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting expert testimony from a law enforcement agent on the topic of stolen vehicle retagging because the evidence aided the jury in its deliberations and did not invade the jury's province. Defendant failed with his objection to the addition of a State's witness because that witness's testimony concerned a charge that was dismissed at the close of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant submitted an application to the county police department for a private watchman's license. The application was referred to the committee, which denied it because of a false answer to a question. The question asked whether he had ever been arrested, detained, or taken into custody or ever investigated by police. The applicant answered in the negative but had been arrested and charged with offenses on three occasions. The trial court affirmed the denial holding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 610.100 - .120 (Cum. Supp. 1984), which dealt with arrest records and protected such records from disclosure, were prospective in their application. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that &sect;&sect; 610.100 - .120 had retrospective as well as prospective operation. To distinguish between pre-enactment and post-enactment arrests would have made &sect;&sect; 610.100 - .120 unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection without a rational relation to some legitimate state interest. The committee contravened Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.120 (Cum.

Stat. &sect; 569.020 (1978), and two counts of armed criminal action, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015 (1978). On appeal, defendant alleged that the circuit court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss pursuant to the speedy trial act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 545.780 (1978), in that the state delayed 39 months before bringing him to trial. Plaintiff State contended that there was no specific timetable for determining whether a speedy trial right had been infringed and that merely because there had been a lengthy delay did not automatically mean the right had been infringed so as to require a reversal. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and held that there was no denial of defendant's speedy trial right, even though the State gave no justification for the delay. The prejudice from the delay was outweighed by the fact that defendant failed to assert his right in other than motions to dismiss and, more importantly, that defendant failed to show actual prejudice to his defense. A lengthy delay, alone, did not necessarily result in a denial of the constitutional right to a speedy trial so as to require reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a drug transaction meeting. His car was seized because it was used to transport cash for the drug sale. During the inventory search of the car, a red spiral notebook was found, which contained gambling records. Defendant alleged several assignments of error. The court noted that pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 572.050 possession had to be either actual or constructive. The court stated that defendant did not have actual possession of the notebook when he was arrested but he did have constructive possession of the notebook. The court reasoned that the notebook was found in a car that was registered to defendant and in which he had been driving. The court also held that defendant's culpable state of mind of conscious and intentional possession of the notebook was strongly supported by the facts. The court determined that the federal agent's warrantless search of the car was justified under the plain view doctrine because it was based on federal forfeiture regulations. The agent was also completely unaware that the police had conducted an earlier search of the car.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the service on the mother by registered mail was authorized by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 452.440 to 452.550. The court found that the mother's assignment of error that the statutes, which permitted service by registered mail, were unconstitutional was not preserved for appellate review. The court held that the state was not divested of jurisdiction over the father's petition due to allegations in the petition that the mother was absent from the state. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the daughter's home state did not change more than six months before the father's filing of the amended motion for modification.

L. No. 83-591, &sect;167, 68A Stat. 51 (1954), to respondent, a privately owned electric utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility had sought as an add-back to its jurisdiction rate base a sum which represented the accumulated deferred taxes, but the Commission had treated the deferred tax reserves as a deduction from the rate base and the deferred taxes related to an investment tax credit for a shorter period as a deduction from the rate base. The trial court's order had required the Commission to add back to the utility's rate base at the same rate of return as the other items making up its capitalized rate base. On review, the court held that there was a substantial evidentiary basis for the Commission's conclusion that the question of whether the utility was flowing through tax timing differences for ratemaking purposes was impossible to determine from the utility's books. The court noted that the record did not positively demonstrate that the utility ever elected to utilize the normalization accounting method as to all its property, and that tax-timing differences which were being flowed-through could not be said to have been normalized. The Commission had the right to fix the rate base without regard to the utility's accounting practices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the Circuit Court of St. Charles County (Missouri), which convicted him of four crimes: escape from confinement, armed criminal action in effecting that escape, aiding the escape of another prisoner, and armed criminal action in perpetrating that crime. Defendant was also found to be a persistent and dangerous offender and was sentenced to multiple, consecutive terms, including life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of first degree robbery and armed criminal action and was in prison awaiting sentencing when he escaped. The lower court convicted him of four crimes and sentenced him to life on the charge of escape, 10 years on the charge of aiding the escape of another, and 20 years on each charge of armed criminal action. The life sentence, the 10-year sentence and one of the 20-year sentences were to be served consecutively. The other 20-year sentence was to be served concurrently with the first 20-year sentence. In affirming the trial court's judgment insofar as the multiple sentences imposed, the court ruled that the lower court properly chose not to instruct the jury as to punishment. Because defendant was found to be a persistent and dangerous offender, the trial court alone was vested with the responsibility of assessing punishment. The court also found that the two charges of armed criminal action did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because defendant committed two distinct felonies through the use of a dangerous instrument. The court did rule that defendant's sentences should have run concurrently with the sentence he was already serving.</SPAN></P>

The court held that any issues surrounding the propriety of that appointment had been resolved by the state supreme court's ruling that the presiding judge was to serve until his term expired or until he was otherwise removed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff borrowers sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which denied their request for a declaratory judgment that a prepayment penalty imposed by defendant bank was prohibited by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.036 (Supp. 1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrowers' loans from the bank were incorporated into promissory notes and were secured by deeds of trust on the borrowers' homes. The notes and/or deeds of trust imposed a penalty if the loans were pre-paid prior to maturity. Each of the notes was pre-paid in full prior to maturity, and the bank charged and collected a prepayment penalty from each of the borrowers. The trial court denied the borrowers' action seeking to have the prepayment penalty prohibited by &sect; 408.036. The borrowers appealed, and the court affirmed. Section 408.036 provided that no prepayment penalty could be charged when the balance was paid after five years from the origination date and prior to maturity. The court disagreed with the borrowers' assertion that the &sect; 408.036 applied retroactively to prohibit the penalties exacted against them. The court ruled that a reasonable construction of the statute was that it acted prospectively and that Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 (1945) not only prohibited laws that impaired obligation of contracts but also prohibited laws that were retrospective in their operation. The borrowers' argument regarding the amount and extent of the impairment was immaterial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution of a decision of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which entered judgment on a jury verdict convicting defendant of forcible rape, first degree burglary, and armed criminal action, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.016 (Supp. 1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was under arrest for a rape charge when he was placed in a line-up for the present case. The victim identified him as her assailant, and he was later convicted. Defendant sought review, and the court found no error. The court denied his speedy trial argument because the statute under which defendant asserted the argument had been repealed. The court held that it was not an ex post facto law violation because the repeal of the speedy trial act did not effect substantive elements of a criminal offense or alter penalties, but was merely a procedural enactment. Further, defendant failed to sustain his burden of showing that the failure to bring him to trial within in a speedy fashion was &quot;occasioned&quot; by the State. As to the prior record of defendant, the court held that the State provided sufficient additional proof of common identity. The court held that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated at his lineup because the case was not related to his other rape charge, for which he had an attorney and, therefore, the right to an attorney did not extend such lineup situations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Construction of houses on four lots began in violation of a city setback ordinance. The lot owners failed to obtain a professional survey, and the subcontractor thus laid the foundation on lot number one in violation of the setback requirement. The board granted the lot owners a variance from the setback ordinance under Eureka, Mo., Ordinance &sect; 23-194(d), and several neighboring landowners petitioned the trial court for certiorari. The trial court held that the board exceeded its authority and reversed its decision. The court affirmed. The hardship resulted from a mistake, not from a unique physical characteristic of the land. Although the lot owners submitted evidence of severe financial hardship, the cause of the hardship did not fit within the framework established by &sect; 23-194. The proponents of the variances failed to show that an irregular shape or topographic condition created hardship. The ordinance unequivocally sets forth these terms, and the board had to follow them. The landowners were in close proximity of the lot owners and were aggrieved parties under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.110 (1978).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a father and son, appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of the County of St. Louis (Missouri) that granted summary judgment in favor of defendant doctor in plaintiffs' medical malpractice suit against the doctor. Summary judgment was granted on the ground that the claims were time-barred under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was burned after the doctor set the son's arm in a cast provided by defendant manufacturer. The court found that the summary judgment was a final judgment for purposes of appeal pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 81.06 because it affected the father's and son's right to recover against the doctor. The summary judgment did not depend on the outcome of the products liability suit against the manufacturer, which was still pending. Suit was filed against the doctor more than two years after the alleged act of neglect. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 established a two-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims and provided that a minor under the age of 10 had until his 12th birthday to file suit. Section 516.105 was unconstitutional as applied to minors. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.170 was the applicable statute of limitations and tolled the limitations period until a minor plaintiff reached majority. Because suit was filed during the son's minority, the suit was not time-barred. There was a disputed fact issue regarding the date the doctor last treated the son's arm. It was improper to determine that the statute of limitations barred the father's claim as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the state's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that four of the prisoner's sentences for receiving stolen property should be vacated because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 570.080 (1978) proscribed a single act, not divisible into parts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An arrestee was convicted of solicitation within one year of the filing of his declaratory judgment action. The action alleged that the existence of &sect; 26.161(c) jeopardized his freedom of speech and association and subjected him to arbitrary arrests and unwarranted prosecutions. Section 26.161(c) prohibited loitering with the purpose of committing illegal actions, such as solicitation. One circumstance that was indicative of purpose was that the person who was loitering was a known prostitute or panderer. The court held that the trial court erroneously granted the city summary judgment. The court held that &sect; 26.161(c) was unconstitutionally overbroad under the United States and Missouri Constitutions. The court held that &sect; 26.161(c) was facially overbroad in that it punished solely on the basis of a person's status as a prostitute or panderer and left the task of differentiating between casual street encounters and obvious acts, which reflected the state of mind needed for solicitation, to law enforcement officers and courts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Boon County (Missouri) that convicted him of rape, arguing that Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped a medical student in the classroom of the medical center building on a university campus. He was charged with and convicted of rape, and the trial court imposed a 45-year sentence without eligibility for probation or parole. Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018.3, the statute under which he was sentenced, was impermissibly vague and that evidence was improperly introduced in violation of his constitutional rights. In rejecting the former argument, the court noted that defendant attacked only one possible construction of the statute. To raise a constitutional question, defendant must have argued that the law was unconstitutional under any possible construction. By failing to do so, defendant failed to present a valid question for review. Further, evidence was not presented pursuant to an invalid search and seizure. Where consent to search the premises was given by the party who rented the entire apartment and who stated that he had free access to defendant's room, his consent was sufficient to render the search valid, and the evidence seized was properly admitted at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his jury conviction for one count of tampering with a witness and one count of tampering with physical evidence. He received consecutive five-year prison terms by the court on each count. On appeal, the court held that defendant did not establish a claim of an unconstitutionally composed jury. However, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support a charge of tampering with physical evidence in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 575.100 (1978). The charge arose from the use at a prior trial of tickets to a wrestling match to prove that defendant had an alibi for the time period during which a prior offense occurred. The court held that there was nothing false about the tickets; rather, testimony concerning the use of the tickets was false. The evidence did not establish that defendant used or presented a false record, document, or thing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for tampering with physical evidence but affirmed the conviction as to tampering with a witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a concealed firearm by one convicted of a dangerous felony. He was also convicted and sentenced as a persistent offender. The trial court imposed a prison sentence of 10 years. On review, defendant contended that the unlawful possession charge, a class C felony, was an enhancement of carrying a concealed weapon (Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.030.1(1) (Supp. 1984)), a class D felony, and that an enhanced sentence under the persistent offender statute subjected him to double jeopardy in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court disagreed and affirmed the convictions and enhanced sentence. The court found that the two possession offenses were separate and distinct, having separate elements, and that even assuming that the unlawful possession charge was an enhancement, prior case law had held that the persistent offender statute was not mutually exclusive and that it had been constitutionally upheld. The court also rejected defendant's claim that he was deprived of a right to a jury trial because the record demonstrated a knowing waiver with advice of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, Chief State Supervisor of the State Board of Parole (Missouri), instituted a proceeding to prohibit respondent circuit court judge from taking any further action and to stay enforcement of a civil contempt order against the Supervisor arising from the Board's election pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.750 (Cum. Supp. 1984) not to supervise a misdemeanant found guilty of careless and imprudent driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge granted the misdemeanant a suspended sentence and placed him on probation to be supervised by the Board. The Board, in its discretion pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.750, elected not to supervise misdemeanants found guilty of careless and imprudent driving. The judge found that the Board's policy constituted a civil contempt of a lawful order and issued a citation for contempt of court and an order to show cause against the Supervisor. The judge contended that &sect; 217.750 was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power to an agency of the executive branch of government and argued that sentencing, including the granting of probation, was inherently a judicial function that could not be proscribed or delegated. The court made its preliminary writ of prohibition absolute, finding that it was a legislative prerogative to create the power of judicial clemency in the form of probation or to deny such power. Therefore, the court concluded that no constitutional infringement upon inherent judicial power resulted from the conferring upon the Board by the legislature of authority to conserve the Board's resources by refusing to supervise certain misdemeanants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father brought an action against defendant mother in which he sought visitation with the parties' son. The Circuit Court of Pettis County (Missouri) granted the father weekly visitation. The mother appealed, arguing that the trial court lacked partiality and prejudged the ultimate issue of whether visitation should be granted before hearing her evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were unmarried. In her answer to the father's petition, the mother alleged that the father was emotionally disturbed, that he had harassed her and her family and was under a court order not to contact her, that he had assaulted her when she was seven months pregnant, and that because of his irrational behavior and violent temper he posed a serious threat to the son's well-being. She asked that the father receive no visitation rights and that he be ordered to pay child support. At the trial, the trial court indicated that it would accept all of the mother's allegations as true but that it was nonetheless going to order visitation. After objection from the mother's counsel that the mother had not been allowed to put on any evidence, the trial court allowed the mother to present some evidence of the father's behavior. Ordering a new trial on the issues of visitation and child support, the court stated that by its comments, the trial court had demonstrated its lack of impartiality by indicating that it had already decided one of the ultimate issues of the case before the mother presented her evidence; thus, the court stated, the mother was denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment finding that the father was the son's natural father. It reversed the decision as to visitation and child support and remanded the case for a new trial on these issues. It recommended that the trial judge who originally heard the case recuse himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges occurred at one criminal episode. It was the robbery of a grocery store and one of the clerks was shot. Defendant claimed that the trial court refused to allow him to proceed pro se. The court held that that point was not preserved for review under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.11(d) because he did not include the point in his motion for a new trial. The court also held that it found no merit in defendant's contention that it was &quot;plain error.&quot; The court stated that the trial court can not be &quot;convicted of error&quot; in denying defendant's right to self-representation in the absence of an unequivocal request to exercise that right. The court held that defendant's written motion for a continuance failed to meet the requirements of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.10 because it was not accompanied by an affidavit and the motion failed to set forth the materially of the evidence and due diligence on the part of the defense to obtain the witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a large telephone company divested itself of its subsidiaries, appellant owned certain common equipment used by customers, such as switchboards and key equipment. However, a different telephone company, respondent, owned the embedded complex inside wire that connected all of the common equipment owned by appellant with the telephone sets used by customers. The Missouri Public Service Commission approved respondent's request to charge appellant for the use of the complex wire. On appeal, the court held that the Commission had the authority to approve the utility charges assessed against appellant pursuant to the Commission's statutory power to supervise telephone companies, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 386.040 (1978), and determine reasonable rates for their services, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.250.6 (1978). The court reasoned also that given the broad statutory language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.020.18 (1978), which defined regulated &quot;service&quot; in its most inclusive sense, appellant was a &quot;user&quot; of the regulated service and subject to charges for such use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had been convicted three times in a state court for driving while intoxicated. One of the convictions was prosecuted under a Missouri Uniform Traffic Ticket and entered by a magistrate on the appearance, plea of guilty, and waiver executed by the signature of defendant on the reverse sheet of that formal information. The parties stipulated that the guilty plea was uncounseled. In affirming the decision, the court found that the grant of a license to drive was subject to suspension or revocation as the law provided. Although conviction and imprisonment of an uncounseled defendant could not stand nor serve as a predicate for an enhanced term of imprisonment criminal proceeding, it had no application in a proceeding where no prison term was imposed. The mandate of the Director of Revenue under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.060 (1978) to forfeit the licensure of the driver for 10 years was invoked by the fact of the prior convictions for driving while intoxicated, rather than the validity of the convictions for collateral criminal law purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant erected an advertising sign on the side of a highway in an unzoned area, not within an incorporated municipality. The sign was within 1,000 feet of railroad tracks and visible from the highway. The tracks were on the other side of the highway. The company located its sign there prior to the State's comprehensive outdoor advertising control law became effective. The law was later amended. The sign had been erected within 660 feet of a right-of-way in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 226.520(5). Noncomplying signs were subject to removal without compensation. Appellant argued that the railroad tracks should have been defined as &quot;commercial or industrial activity&quot; in order that its sign fell within the exception to &sect; 226.520. The court upheld the trial court's order. The court reasoned that to construe the word &quot;commercial&quot; to encompass railroad tracks under the State's billboard law would defeat the purpose of the law as stated in Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the legitimate children and an illegitimate daughter, challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which held in respondent trustee's declaratory judgment action that respondent claimant, but not the illegitimate daughter, was a proper recipient of the distributions from a trust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court determined in the trustee's declaratory judgment action that the claimant, who was also the beneficiary's illegitimate child, but not the illegitimate daughter was a &quot;lawful issue&quot; that deserved a share of the trust's distributions. The court reversed the holding that the claimant was the beneficiary's lawful issue, affirmed the denial of any share of the distribution to the illegitimate daughter, and remanded the action for the entry to amend the judgment as to the percentage of the distributions to which the legitimate children were entitled. The court concluded that it was acknowledged that the illegitimate daughter was born out of wedlock and held that the &quot;good faith&quot; exception that legitimatized an otherwise invalid marriage's offspring did not apply because the only proof of a good faith belief in the validity of the beneficiary's marriage to her mother was found to not be credible. The court further found that the &quot;good faith&quot; exception did not apply to the claimant either because it was undisputed that her mother and the beneficiary never participated in a marriage ceremony and that a statute that dealt with intestacy rights was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling in the trustee's declaratory judgment action that held that the claimant was not in the class of &quot;lawful issue&quot; that was entitled to a share of the trust's distributions, reversed the holding that the illegitimate daughter deserved a share of the distribution, and remanded the action for the entry of an amended judgment as to the percentage of the distributions that the legitimate children deserved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations paid their merchants' and manufacturers' taxes under protest, sending a protest letter with the payments, as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031.0 (1978). The corporations commenced an action against the Collector to recover the taxes, which was dismissed by the trial court. The corporations appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the merchants' and manufacturers' tax. The court held that the corporations' protest was based upon the fact that their property, as that of merchants and manufacturers, allegedly was assessed at a higher percentage of its value than other property within the same taxing jurisdiction, and thus the assessment illegally discriminated against them. The corporations did not seek administrative review before bringing their action under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031 (1978). The corporations made no claim that the administrative remedies were unavailable to them. While the taxation of the corporations' property might well reach the magnitude of an infringement of their constitutional rights, the corporations were not excused from pursuing and exhausting their administrative remedies before the courts would act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suspicious origins of the assureds' house fire led the insurer to deny coverage. The assureds filed suit but lost at trial. The assureds secured no relief on their ensuing appeal. Several of the assureds' appellate points violated Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.04(d) because they did not identify the trial court action or ruling that was allegedly erroneous. The assureds also ignored the rule that the scope of objections made at trial could not be broadened upon appeal. The trial court properly admitted evidence that the assureds contended was illegally seized from their house because the exclusionary rule did not prohibit the introduction of such proof in a civil action. The trial court rightly excluded the assureds' proffered evidence that one of the assureds had been acquitted of an arson charge arising from the fire that predicated the instant action. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the insurer's counsel to read into evidence an expert witness's testimony from the criminal trial because the expert witness was unavailable. Because none of the assureds' exceptions constituted error, neither did they cumulate to the level of prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cape Girardeau (Missouri), which granted defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence of test results based on a blood sample taken from him following a car accident in violation of the state's refusal statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.041(1984), his Miranda rights, and denial of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a car accident in which the police suspected that defendant had been drinking. At the hospital, after several attempts, the police obtained defendant's acquiescence to a blood-alcohol test that showed defendant had been intoxicated. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision to grant defendant's motion to suppress. The &quot;refusal statute,&quot; at &sect; 577.041, operated in tandem with the &quot;implied consent&quot; statute of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.020 (1984). Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.041(1984), if a person under arrest refused to take a blood-alcohol test, none could be given, and the arrestee's license could be revoked. The court found that the conduct of the police towards defendant at the hospital constituted an arrest and he invoked his right to refuse the test. Defendant's &quot;consent&quot; to the test was involuntary. Administration of the test was performed after defendant invoked his Miranda rights. The police denied defendant the right to confer with counsel as they refused to provide him with the means to contact his mother, an attorney, prior to taking the test.</SPAN></P>

The highway commission brought an action in prohibition whereby the highway commission sought an order that commanded the judge to refrain from proceeding in the wrongful death action against the highway commission and to dismiss the third-party petition as to the highway commission. The court issued a preliminary order in prohibition, and the judge filed a motion to quash the preliminary order. The court held that: (1) case law did not allow a governmental entity that was shielded from tort liability by sovereign immunity under statute to be joined as a party in a tort case for the purpose of adjudicating its share of liability for the damages sustained by the injured party; and (2) there was no merit to the judge's contention that even if the state highway commission was immune from liability, it was not immune from suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company paid the convict for the damages caused by a fire to the convict's house.

The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment because the judgment entered following service of summons on the convict while he was incarcerated without the appointment of a trustee could not have stood.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed order of the Circuit Court of Wayne County (Missouri), which convicted him of fraud in the sale of a security, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 409.101, and offering an unregistered security for sale in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 409.301. The trial court sentenced defendant to a total of 30 years' imprisonment and ordered all sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised and sold fur-bearing animals. He advertised five investment plans with funds used to purchase animals and to pay for their care. Proceeds from the offspring's sale were to be paid in part to the investor with the rest going towards continued care of the remaining herd. Defendant was charged with offering securities that were not registered for sale, and for making untrue statements of material facts or misleading statements in the sales. Defendant was found guilty of fraud in the sale of securities. The court found that defendant failed to preserve most of his claims of error and that the burden of claiming a registration exemption was on defendant. The court found the formation of the satellite companies was for the purposes of avoiding registration rather than acting as legitimate separate entities. Defendant failed to timely object to the jury composition. The evidence was sufficient to find that all of the charged offenses were parts of a common scheme or plan by which defendant induced investors to purchase contracts with the various satellite companies and by which he induced investors to make loans to, and purchase stock in, the parent company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the adjudication of guilt on three counts of fraudulently selling securities by omitting material facts. The court reversed the guilty finding of one count of failing to disclose that he was using investment funds for his own purposes and to pay previous investors. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial one count of selling unregistered securities and one count of selling a security without disclosing material facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two game wardens questioned one defendant, a farmer, because they suspected him of unlawful taking or possession of wildlife. They wanted to talk to the second defendant, a carpenter, about a deer and some turkey feathers found on his property. That night the wardens waited at an adjacent farm. Defendants approached in a truck, and the carpenter threatened the wardens with his gun. The farmer brandished his gun but did not aim it at the wardens. At the trial, the jury was instructed with regard to the carpenter alone on the reduced charge of third degree assault. On appeal, the court held that the constitutional challenges to the statute were not properly preserved. There was sufficient proof that each defendant had attempted to assault the wardens. The jury instruction on the reduced charge for the carpenter was erroneous, and the farmer could not claim prejudice. There was no proof of a conflict of interest by the attorney who represented them both at the trial. The court declined to hold that the representation of multiple defendants was per se violative of their Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former wife challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that dismissed her application for a trial de novo after a judgment was entered in associate circuit court in favor of plaintiff former husband in his unlawful detainer action against her. The circuit court found that it lacked jurisdiction because no appeal bond was filed pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 534.380 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parties' divorce, the wife occupied the marital residence, which had not been awarded to either party in the divorce decree. In his unlawful detainer action, the husband claimed that the house was his by way of a conveyance from his father. When the associate circuit court found in the husband's favor, it set an appeal bond pursuant to &sect; 534.380. The wife failed to file the bond and applied for a trial de novo. Finding that it lacked jurisdiction, the circuit court granted the husband's motion to dismiss her application, in opposition to which the wife argued that &sect; 534.380 was unconstitutional. She did not raise that issue in subsequent motions to dismiss the husband's action and to set aside the associate circuit court judgment as void. The court dismissed the appeal. The posting of a bond was a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the circuit court and, therefore, of the court. The only ground presented by the wife that could have given her jurisdiction was the constitutional issue. The issue was not preserved for appellate review, however, because she did not include it in her motions. Neither the circuit court nor the court, therefore, ever acquired jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the wife's appeal from the circuit court judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent gravel company sued appellant landowner, seeking to enforce a lien created by a special tax bill. The Circuit Court of Jasper County (Missouri) entered summary judgment for the gravel company and denied a summary judgment motion filed by the landowner. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that the action should have been dismissed, as it was not brought within the applicable five-year statute of limitations, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.120, even as extended by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.230. The appellate court ruled that a party desiring to avail himself of the statute of limitations was required to plead the particular statute on which he relied. An allegation that the claim was &quot;barred by the statute of limitations&quot; was insufficient. The landowner did not plead either Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.120 or Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.230. Therefore, the landowner did not preserve the statute of limitations defense. The landowner also argued that Joplin, Mo., Charter &sect; 11.80 was unconstitutional. However, the issue of the constitutionality of an ordinance, or a charter provision, needed to be raised at the first available opportunity. The section of the constitution claimed to have been violated needed to be specified. The landowner's failure to raise the constitutional issue at the first available opportunity and to specify the constitutional provision claimed to have been violated precluded this issue as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to 3 counts of robbery in the first degree, pursuant to a plea agreement in which the state would recommend 10 year sentences on each count, to run concurrently. The trial court sentenced defendant to 3 sentences of 10 years, to run consecutively. The Circuit Court of Lincoln County (Missouri) denied defendant's Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion to vacate judgments and sentences. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion, as the trial court was without discretion to deny said motion in that defendant was erroneously informed that the minimum sentences on all counts would run concurrently, when Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;546.480 (1969) required consecutive sentences. The appellate court concluded that the trial court's finding was supported by the record and not clearly erroneous, noting that defendant was asked whether he understood that the trial court was not required to follow the state's recommendations and was informed of the maximum possible sentence that could be imposed. The fact appellant did not know the court was required to impose the sentence consecutively was not significant, as he was told that the state's recommendation would not be followed. Defendant also contended that, in the event he was not entitled to withdraw his pleas, he was entitled to have his sentence vacated inasmuch as &sect; 546.480 was held unconstitutional. The appellate court found no merit in defendant's argument, as the record indicated that the consecutive sentences were not imposed by reason of the mandate of &sect; 546.480.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's imposition of 3 consecutive 10-year sentences was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, affirmed respondent highway commission's order directing appellant advertiser to remove its billboards on grounds they had lost their nonconforming status. The advertiser appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advertiser challenged the judgment entered against it, raising three contentions. The appeals court found all three lacked merit. First, the facts showed that for 21 months after the regulation became available, there were no products or services available at the advertised destination. The advertiser had 12 months after the effective date of the regulation to correct the sign's message, but failed to do so. It mattered not that the products advertised continued to exist through the period in question. Abandonment or discontinuance occurred when the products or services could not be obtained at the destination. Second, compensation was not in order for removal of the signs. To adopt the advertiser's argument would be to nullify federal law relating to pre-existing nonconforming signs, and the state regulations which set forth criteria, to define destruction, abandonment, and discontinuance. Third, Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 10-6.060(3)(E) (1977) was not unconstitutionally applied. The regulation applied was of minimal nature to enable the state not to lose 10 percent of federal funds for highway purposes.</SPAN></P>
