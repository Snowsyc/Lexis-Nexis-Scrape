Acts 708, which amended Ala. Code &sect; 40-20-2 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rendered a judgment on remand from a previous appeal according to the stipulation of the parties, but the oil companies appealed because the legislature amended the oil and gas severance tax provision. The oil companies contended that the legislature changed the purpose of Ala. Code &sect; 40-20-2 (1975) in passing 1980 Ala. Acts 708. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the purpose of the statute had not been changed and that it did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 61. The court found that the purpose of 1980 Ala. Acts 408 was to amend Ala. Code &sect; 40-20-2 (1975) and to provide for the oil and gas tax. The court engaged in statutory interpretation and found that in the field of revenue legislation, a substitute bill sharing the same purpose for raising revenues did not violate the state constitution. The court found that the amending bill did not deviate from the purpose of amending the oil and gas severance tax. The court further noted that the classification providing for a greater tax on companies enjoying greater privileges in the state was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's planning commission voted to recommend approval of the nursing home owners' application for a rezoning of property they had acquired for expansion. On appeal, the residents argued that Ala. Code &sect; 11-52-3(a) (1975) limited the ex officio membership on the planning commission to one city commissioner. The residents asserted that the city was required to undergo the required selection process on each occasion when the office of mayor was transferred. The court held that to have three city commissioners sitting on the planning commission did not violate the statutory purpose of representing the different branches of city government on the planning commission. Further, there was no indication that the commissioners were rejecting consideration of the factors legally relevant to the merits of the zoning decision. The court had no reason to doubt the trial court's conclusion that the commissioners' zoning decision was fairly debated. The trial court's specific factual findings were sufficient to show that reasonable differences could have existed on the merits of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant liquor warehouse sought review of a decision of the trial court (Alabama), which entered a final order in favor of appellees, alcoholic beverage control board and board members. The warehouse brought an action against appellees challenging the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 28-3A-12 (1975) and its prohibition against Sunday sales of alcoholic beverages for &quot;off premises&quot; consumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warehouse was the holder of a valid club license issued by the board. The warehouse sold alcoholic beverages in their original containers for off-premises consumption to members of the club and to their guests every day of the week including Sunday. The warehouse brought an action against appellees and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 28-3A-12 and its prohibition against Sunday sales of alcoholic beverages for &quot;off-premises&quot; consumption by licensees of the board. The warehouse unsuccessfully sought declaratory and injunction relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court found that, although there was no constitutional right to sell or consume alcoholic beverages, regulation of their sale and consumption was not exempt from all constitutional challenge. The court, however, stated that there was a legitimate state purpose in the challenged enactment and added that the statute bore a rational relationship to its explicit purpose. The court also stated that both arms of the reasonable classification test of equal protection were satisfied in the legislative motivation behind the passage of &sect; 28-3A-12 and in its ultimate effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the alcoholic beverage control board and its members.</SPAN></P>

Four actions were brought against the steel company among other defendants in Alabama. The decedents were employees of Alabama companies.

The steel company, whose principal place of business was London, England, and who was not qualified to do business in Alabama, contended that the trial court lacked in personam jurisdiction over it. The steel company's wholly-owned subsidiary was qualified to do business in Alabama and thousands of tons of steel were shipped into Alabama through the subsidiary's Houston operations. The court denied the steel company's petition for writ of mandamus. The court held that where the steel company systematically and continuously shipped its products to Alabama through a subsidiary that was organized to serve the steel company in the sale and distribution of its products, its activities were substantial and continuous so as to allow in personam jurisdiction to be asserted against it in causes of action that arose outside of Alabama.</SPAN></P>

P18-031, upon which the commissioner relied in denying a refund, and the department's enforcement thereof resulted in an unconstitutional application of Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-2 and other relevant state revenue laws. On review, the commissioner contended that the supplements were never resold by the corporation, but simply distributed to the public by the newspapers, and that the corporation was the ultimate consumer of the supplements. The court affirmed. The court agreed that the corporation did not manufacture any product in which it included the supplements, but did not agree that it consumed them. The court found that, for purposes of taxation, all purchasers of newspaper advertising supplements that were inserted and distributed in the newspaper had to be treated equally. The court held that an advertising supplement, which was printed solely for the purpose of being inserted into a newspaper and distributed in the newspaper, was an integral part of that newspaper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the law and the court affirmed. The court held that the rule did not authorize arbitration, compulsory or otherwise, but merely provided an administrative procedure for grievance resolution for public employees. In addition, the rule's definition of grievance excluded all but day-to-day employee complaints.

On appeal of the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the city, the court affirmed. The court declined to determine if Ala. Code &sect; 35-15-1 et seq. (1975) applied to municipalities and ruled that under established rules of premises liability the city did not breach any duty of care owed to the minor sons. The court determined that there was no allegation that the city did some positive act creating a new hidden danger avoidable through the use of reasonable care and skill and that the two sons intentionally subjected themselves to the danger by entering the water to swim.

The court held that &sect; 43-1-15 provided a constitutionally impermissible gender-based classification under the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions because the classification did not bear a substantial relationship to an important governmental objective. The court found that the legislature's purpose in enacting &sect; 43-1-15 was the protection of woman, which as part of the baggage of sexual stereotypes did not sustain the constitutionality of &sect; 43-1-15. Although reducing the economic disparity between men and women, and assisting needy spouses were important governmental objectives, the court determined that the classification contained in &sect; 43-1-15 was not substantially related to those objectives because they could have been fulfilled by a gender-neutral statute.

When the vessels were boarded, police discovered marijuana on the second vessel but not aboard the yacht.

Defendant contended that although 19 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1581(a) granted customs agents broad statutory authority to stop and search for contraband, the Fourth Amendment imposed a reasonableness requirement upon custom searches. The court held, however, that it was well-settled that customs officers could conduct a search of a vessel or person at the borders of the United States or the functional equivalent of the United States borders, without a warrant, without probable cause, or even without suspicion of illegal activity. Further, the court held that a reasonable suspicion existed of illegal activity taking place aboard the vessels.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">County residents filed suit against certain officials challenging the constitutionality of an Act, which created a county planning commission. The residents filed a motion for summary judgment contending the Act was invalid under various constitutional grounds. The court reversed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment for the officials and rendered judgment for the residents. The court concluded that the circuit court could dispose of the entire case by granting summary judgment to the officials only if it found that there was not a scintilla of evidence supporting the residents' position. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional and in violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 106 because there were substantial differences between the substance of the published Act for public debate and the bill which passed the legislature. The court found that the enacted legislation exempted certain special interests, such as mining railroad and utilities, and withdrew control of the planning commission from the county governing body that was composed of elected officials answerable to the voters. Such material differences warranted judicial intervention to declare the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that the legislative resolutions that authorized the expense allowance were in violation of several provisions of the Alabama Constitution. The legislature passed H.J.R. 223 (Ala. 1971), which provided, in part, payment of the reasonable expenses of the presiding officer of each house of the legislature. Thereafter, S.R. 112 (Ala. 1971) was passed, which provided for payment of the lieutenant governor's actual and necessary expenses. Subsequently, the Senate Ethics Committee set the expense allowance at a fixed sum of $ 1,500 per month. Eight months after leaving office, the former lieutenant governor sought to be paid the expense allowed that had been withheld from him. The court affirmed and held first, that $ 1,500 per month was a reasonable amount for his expenses and therefore that sum did not constitute compensation to him in whole or in part. The resolutions were not violative of the state constitution, were within the plenary power of the legislature, and in refusing to make the payments, defendants failed to perform their legal duties; that is, the lawsuit was not barred by Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local Act was enacted establishing the county civic center authority. The director of revenue, in seeking to collect on levied sales and use taxes, challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 106 because of a variance between &sect; 4 of the published local law and &sect; 4 of the enacted local law. The variance centered upon the method of selection of the non-ex officio members of the authority's board of directors. The advertised version provided that the entire legislative electoral college was to vote jointly, and the enacted version provided instead that the senate and house delegations were to each vote separately, and that the senate delegation was to elect one more member than the house delegation. The trial court entered an order declaring that the changes were not material changes and the Act was not unconstitutional on any of the several grounds asserted by the director. The director appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in its application of &sect; 106. The court reversed the declaratory judgment, holding that it disagreed with the trial court that the changes were immaterial because the altered selection authority went to the essence of the selection process itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor issued an executive memorandum stating that no department, agency, or board was to request a waiver of the 70 year old mandatory retirement for government employees without certain approval to have been given only when the public health of the state would have been impaired. The employee was a 73 year old state government worker who lost her job because of the executive memorandum. The employee filed an action alleging the governor's memorandum violated Ala. Const. 1901, art. III, &sect; 43 because is removed the ability of state workers who were over 70 to remain employed under certain conditions, as permitted under Ala. Code &sect; 36-27-16(a)(1)(c) (1975). The governor filed a motion to dismiss and argued that he was immune from the action under Ala. Const. 1901, art. I, &sect; 14. The trial court granted the motion and the employee sought review. The court found that the memorandum did not specifically amend the requirements of Ala. Code &sect; 36-27-16(a)(1)(c), but that the employee was able to show that the memorandum prevented the employee's department head from freely giving a recommendation whether to retain the employee, and that the memorandum was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 11-88-40 et seq., was a general law. Therefore, the court concluded that it was not necessary for the law to comply with the requirements set forth in Ala. Const. &sect; 106 or the passage of a local act. Moreover, the court rejected the resident property owner's argument that the assessment provision violated Ala.

The court held that the special assessment was not a &quot;tax,&quot; within the constitutional meaning of the word &quot;tax.&quot; The court concluded that the water and sewer authority was empowered to assess the costs against only that property, which was peculiarly benefited by the improvements, and only to the extent of the increased value of the property so improved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's child was a student at a day care operated by the university. The employee placed the child upon a piece of playground equipment when he fell and suffered severe injuries. The trial court dismissed the mother's action against all defendants on the basis of sovereign immunity afforded by Ala. Const. &sect; 14. The court reversed and remanded the summary judgment for the employee, but affirmed summary judgment for the university and its president. No case had ever held that a state employee could never be sued for simple negligence committed in the line and scope of his or her employment. A claim for personal injury based upon the alleged negligent conduct of a state employee, even when committed in the line and scope of employment, was not within the ambit of &sect; 14's protection because any state interest affected by the suit was far too incidental to supply the requisite nexus for extension of constitutional immunity to the individual employee defendant. The doctrine of substantive immunity did not apply because the employee was not engaged in a discretionary function and there was no public policy reason for extending the immunity to the employee.</SPAN></P>

Acts 689 (Act). Appellants contested the ruling of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of the retailers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act required manufacturers of malt or brewed beverages that marketed its products in a certain county to designate a sales territory for each brand sold in the county and name an exclusive wholesaler for that territory. It also made it unlawful for retail beer dealers in the county to purchase any brand of malt or brewed beverage from anyone other than the brand's wholesaler in the county, under penalty of revocation of the dealer's license. The retailers contested the Act's constitutionality. The trial court ruled for the retailers. Reversing the judgment and dismissing the case, the court held that the Act did not violate the prohibition of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105 that no local law could regulate a subject subsumed by an extant general law. Although the Act was a local law, Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 104 permitted the legislature to enact local laws regulating liquor traffic. Further, the Act did not violate equal protection. Given the heavy presumption for state power, the Act was reasonably related to a legitimate state purpose of preventing tax revenue losses from the dealers' failure to report their wholesale beer purchases outside the county to county tax officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representative of the decedent's estate dismissed a malpractice suit against the physicians, apparently in order to comply with a procedural requirement that a previously filed personal injury suit could not be amended to allege wrongful death, but was required to be dismissed and a new suit brought. The personal representative argued that the Wrongful Death Act, Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-410 (1975), statute of limitations, which provided for the action to have been brought within two years of death, should have applied to the lawsuit even though the act giving rise to the cause of action arose out of an alleged act of medical malpractice. The physicians contended that the Alabama Medical Liability Act, Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-480, et seq. (1975), provided a carefully designed statute of limitations which by its terms applied to &quot;all actions&quot; for medical malpractice. The court reversed and remanded the lower court's dismissal and held that the medical malpractice statute of limitations did not apply to bar the action.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 41-9-90 through -126 (1975) and 1980 Ala. Acts 80-121. Appellees' complaint alleged that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional on the grounds that the licenses, fees, and taxes imposed by the statutes denied them due process and equal protection of the law and that the statutes were discriminatory and confiscatory and provided for double taxation. The trial court held the statutes in question unconstitutional. From the adverse ruling, the commissioner appealed. The court held that Alabama had the authority to regulate boxing, sparring, and wrestling regardless of the absence of, or the existence of, lesser regulations imposed on other sporting events in the state. States are allowed a wide range of discretion as long as that which is enacted by the legislature has some reasonable basis and is not purely arbitrary. While the legislature had the power to regulate wrestling, sparring, and boxing; the distribution of one-half the monies to the American Legion was improperly accomplished and violated Ala.

The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) entered a judgment for the general contractors and permanently enjoined the enforcement of the challenged ordinance. The city sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged ordinance required that a contractor make a good faith effort to meet the city's goal of awarding 15 per cent of every construction contract exceeding $ 20,000 to minority businesses. In order to demonstrate this good faith, a contractor was required to submit, along with its bid, a specific plan for 10 per cent minority participation in the contract, or to request a waiver of the 10 percent requirement. The lowest bid was not considered unless it was accompanied either by a waiver request or by a list of proposed minority subcontractors. The court found that (1) the ordinance was invalid because it contravened the Alabama Competitive Bid Law, Ala. Code &sect; 41-16-50, without constitutional justification and (2) the ordinance established a racial classification resulting in a discriminatory preference for certain minority groups, which violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000 et seq., and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a sheriff and law enforcement officers, sought review of a judgment of the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama), which permanently enjoined them from instituting charges against or arresting employees of appellee supermarket for operating businesses on Sunday in alleged violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-1 (1975), the Sunday Blue Laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supermarket's manager and assistant manager were arrested for violation of the Alabama Sunday Blue Laws. The supermarket then filed an action seeking an injunction. After a full hearing, the trial court entered an order permanently enjoining the sheriff and other law enforcement officers. The trial judge found that the legislation was so vague, ambiguous, and uncertain that it was impossible of uniform interpretation by persons of reasonable intelligence, and that the legislation was unconstitutional. Affirming, the court held that that the trial court's holding that the supermarket's rights under the United States Constitution and the Alabama Constitution were violated by the unequal enforcement of the Sunday closing laws was supported by the record. The court found that the record demonstrated without question that application of the law to the supermarket amounted to an unequal, invidious, and discriminatory enforcement of the law that deprived the supermarket of its property rights, equal protection, and due process guarantees, where the supermarket was the only business at which arrests were made even though many other businesses stayed open on Sunday.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the parties to both causes were &quot;substantially identical.&quot; Therefore, plaintiffs' action in the circuit court was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, whereby a judgment on the merits in a prior suit barred a second suit involving the same parties or their privities, and applied when both parties to the suit were &quot;substantially identical.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Act was not in violation of the single subject/express title requirement of the Ala. Const. &sect; 45. Likewise, neither the due process nor the equal protection provisions of the state or federal constitutions were not offended, as the Act did not fall within the constitutional definition of special, private, or local laws.

Acts 434 to be unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act amended Ala. Code &sect; 40-20-2 (1975), which provided for a tax on oil and gas producers in the amount of five percent of the gross value of the oil or gas at the point of production. The Act changed the amount to six percent. The Act contained a provision that the additional increase was limited to those oil and gas wells from between 15,000 and 15,800 feet in the &quot;smackover formation.&quot;The smackover formation existed in only 12 counties, and at the time the Act was passed the only production in the smackover formation was in one county. The oil and gas producers contended that the Act was therefore a local act. The trial court found that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that the intent of the legislature was to levy the tax upon every person engaging in the business of producing or severing oil or gas in the state. The court concluded that its duty was to interpret the Act in accordance with the legislature's stated intention and in so doing, it decided that the smackover provision was a limitation on the taxing of new wells, and not a limitation on the entire Act. The court concluded that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff asbestos workers appealed from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered a summary judgment order in favor of defendant manufacturers of asbestos products. The lower court had held that 1980 Ala. Acts 80-566, which amended Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-39 (1975), was inapplicable and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff asbestos workers sought recovery under the Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine and for defendants' alleged wantonness and negligence. Defendant manufacturers' motions for summary judgment were granted on the grounds that the actions were barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Ala. Code &sect; 6-2-39 (1975), as plaintiffs had failed to prove exposure to defendants' products within the year preceding the suit. The lower court ruled that 1980 Ala. Acts 80-566, which extended the statute of limitations retroactively, was not applicable to these cases and was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs appealed and the court reversed, for reconsideration. The court held that if, before the effective date of the new law, one year had elapsed between the date of plaintiffs' exposure and the date on which plaintiffs' action was commenced, then that claim was nevertheless barred by the statute of limitations. As to such claims, the new law was unconstitutional under Ala. Const. &sect; 95 because that section restricted the legislature's power to enact legislation that would destroy rights that had vested when the new statute was passed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cases for reconsideration. The constitutionality of the new statute of limitations was upheld insofar as it established a discovery rule for the accrual of asbestos injury actions in Alabama and allowed one year after discovery for the commencement of actions. However, the statute was unconstitutional as to claims already time barred at the time of passage of the new law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owner applied for certain variances at a time when the city had no designated zoning board. Such a body was instituted five months later. The lot owner's request for a variance was denied. The lot owner appealed the denial of the variance, and he also brought a separate cause of action in the circuit court alleging the unconstitutionality of the zoning ordinance. While the zoning appeal was pending, the circuit court ruled in the lot owner's favor. On appeal, the court affirmed the determination. The lot owner's assertions were additionally grounded on claims of discrimination, denial of due process, and equal protection as they applied to him. The court held that because the powers of the Board were specifically limited to those contained in Ala. Code &sect; 11-52-80 (1975), the Board was without authority to consider any constitutional attack on the ordinance, and that the lot owner's constitutional challenge to the ordinance in the circuit court was not precluded by the city's claims of identical issues in both proceedings. The circuit court did not err by assuming jurisdiction of the cause during the pendency of the lot owner's appeal from the action of the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed by plaintiffs against defendants, other tenants in common, seeking a sale for division of land. Plaintiffs each owned approximately 3/110 of the property, while defendants owned approximately 83 percent of the property. The trial court issued its decree finding that the land could not be equitably divided and ordered a sale for division. On appeal, defendants questioned whether Ala. Code &sect; 35-6-100 (1975) was applicable to the facts of the case inasmuch as the action was filed prior to the effective date of the statute. The court held that under &sect; 35-6-100, the date which was important in determining whether the statute required an impermissible retrospective application was the date set for trial. Since the effective date of &sect; 35-6-100 was at least 10 days prior to the earliest possible date on which trial could have been set and since defendants' request was filed at least 10 days prior to that date, &sect; 35-6-100 would have been applicable in the present case. Therefore, the trial court erred in not applying &sect; 35-6-100 and the judgment of the trial court in that regard was due to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

The father argued that the trial court's application of the &quot;tender years presumption&quot; was unconstitutional. The court reversed, remanded, and found that the presumption required the custody of young children to be awarded to the mother when the parties were equally fit parents and thus imposed an evidentiary burden on the father to prove the positive unfitness of the mother. The court ruled that any statutory scheme that imposed obligations on husbands, but not on wives, established a classification based upon sex that was subject to scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the same was also true for a legal presumption that imposed evidentiary burdens on fathers, but not on mothers. The court found that the state's substantial interest in overseeing the care and custody of infants was served by the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; rule, and that the tender years presumption impeded full application of that rule. In remanding, the court directed a consideration of the individual facts relative to both parents to truly derive the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The receipts the state sought to tax under Ala. Code &sect; 40-21-57 (1975) were derived from the railroad's movement of various products to and from a port. These movements consisted of both export and import shipments. The railroad maintained that the shipments involved interstate commerce and not intrastate commerce. The court noted that the controlling issue was whether, in originally enacting &sect; 40-21-57, the legislature intended to tax this type of transaction. The court presumed that, in enacting the statute in 1935, the legislature was aware of the existing interpretations and permissible limits of the state's power to tax. Viewed in its broadest scope, &sect; 40-21-57 could reach and impose a tax upon only those activities that were local and purely intrastate in character. Reversing the judgment, the court held that &sect; 40-21-57 was not intended to apply to receipts generated by transactions such as these that, although conducted wholly within the confines of Alabama, constituted an integral portion or segment of interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the sale and dispensing of eyeglasses and contact lenses constituted a sale of tangible personal property as defined by the sales tax laws of Alabama.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This litigation involved the purchase of oil from wells unitized or appropriated pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 9-17-83(7). In affirming the judgment for the purchaser, the court first held that &sect; 9-17-83(7) was constitutional, that the owner had been afforded ample due process at the time of the appropriation, and that the appropriation occurred at the time &sect; 9-17-83(7) was passed, and not at the time the unit operator appropriated the oil for the payment of unit expenses. The court further held that this taking for payment was not state action that would trigger further constitutional guarantees. The court next held that the purchaser could invoke a prior judgment in an action between the owner and the unit operator as res judicata, as it had been in privity with the unit operator. On the other hand, the owner could not invoke the same judgment against the purchaser, because the mutuality of interests requirement of res judicata was not present in the prior action as to the issues urged by the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A family was driving at night when defendant passed their car. The driver turned his automobile headlights to bright and then immediately to dim, then to bright to inform defendant that he was clear of the automobile and could return to the right side of the road. Defendant stopped his car in the road, jumped out, and approached the family's car. He stood at the front bumper and used abusive language, ordering the driver to dim his lights. Defendant was found guilty of using abusive, insulting, or obscene language in violation of &sect; 13-6-18. He appealed, arguing that the statute was facially overbroad and unconstitutional. The appellate court reversed his conviction, declaring that the statute was unconstitutional, and the State sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was based in part on a concern for the sensitivities of females and was designed to protect females from insult at all times. Those concerns were no longer viable in light of the recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court that statutory classifications distinguishing between males and females based on &quot;old notions&quot; no longer withstood judicial scrutiny under U.S. Const. amend.

The Department counterclaimed against appellants for the costs required to finish the project. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the Department on both the claim for unpaid expenses and on its counterclaim for costs of finishing the project. The court held that the contract language, as construed in conjunction with the surrounding provisions, meant that the one million dollars was the estimated fees, but that the amount was the maximum reimbursable cost for the project to the appraisal firm. The court also held that appellants' improperly ceased work and thus defaulted on the contract, entitling the Department to its costs to complete the project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a capital offense and sentenced to death. On appeal, the Court held that the death sentence was unconstitutional because it was imposed after a jury verdict of guilt of a capital offense when the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser-included offense, when the evidence would have supported such a verdict. Such procedure was required by Alabama's death sentence statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-2(a) (1975). On remand, the court reversed the decision of the lower court and remanded. The court concluded that the statute could be salvaged by severing the preclusion clause and by construing as permissive the clause requiring the jury to fix a punishment of death if it found the accused guilty of a capital offense. The court held that all death penalty trials would include a guilt phase separate from a sentencing phase, and each death sentence would be reviewed to ascertain whether the crime was in fact one properly punishable by death, whether similar crimes throughout the state were being punished capitally, and whether the sentence of death was appropriate in relation to the particular defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner brought an action for inverse condemnation against the Department of Conservation seeking compensation for 243 raccoons, his private property, which he alleged was taken for public use by the Department. The property owner was duly licensed by the state to raise raccoons for stocking and propagation purposes. The raccoons were being transported under health certificates issued by the State of Florida to a consignee in Alabama. The property owner was arrested for selling live raccoons and was advised each raccoon could be a separate offense. Officers suggested that the raccoons be let go in various locations, which the raccoon specialist did. The court held that the property owner was not entitled to recover for inverse condemnation and that the suit was barred by Ala. Const. art. I, &sect;14. The court held that art. I, &sect; 14 prohibited suit against State officers and agents in their official capacity or individually when a result favorable to the property owner would directly affect a contract or property right of the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and her partner, both certified public accountants, contracted for the sale of their accounting partnership to defendants. Under the contract, defendants agreed to pay them a percentage of fees paid to defendants from the partnership's ex-clients. Additionally, the contract contained a covenant not to compete, whereby the partners agreed not to compete against defendants in the accounting trade for six years. After several years, defendants ceased making the specified payments to plaintiff. Defendants contended that payments to plaintiff ceased because plaintiff violated the covenant. In plaintiff's action to recover sums due under the contract, the court granted defendants summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the contract's restrictive covenant violated Ala. Code &sect; 8-1-1 in that it unlawfully restricted the accounting profession.

The bar pilot filed this action against the members of the commission and asked the trial court to declare the state's compulsory retirement of bar pilots law unconstitutional because it conflicted with the provisions of the FADEA. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the commission. The court affirmed and determined that the commission as an agency was an employer under 19 U.S.C.S. &sect; 630 for the purposes of the FADEA. However, the court concluded that absent an express intent by Congress to supersede and preempt the state regulation of bar pilots, the FADEA had not superseded the compulsory retirement of bar pilots. The court found in the alternative that even under the FADEA, the commission could place restrictions on the age for compulsory retirement because it was a bona fide occupation qualification.</SPAN></P>

Const. Amend. 73 and Act No. 46, Alabama's system of classification of property for ad valorem taxation, violated no state or federal constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a declaratory judgment action, claiming that their property should have had ad valorem taxes imposed at the same rate as &quot;single-family owner-occupied residential property.&quot; The trial court declared no constitutional violations. An appeal was taken. The court held that the State had a rational basis for classifying real property for ad valorem taxation based on the use to which the property was devoted. The court found that the fact that Amendment 373 discriminated in favor of the owners of single-family residences did not render it arbitrary as the discrimination was founded upon a reasonable distinction in state policy. In this case, the policy of Amendment 373, as to the taxation of residential property was plain. The State intended to tax owners of single-family residences at a lower rate than the owners of other residential property because residential property which was not used as a single-family residence generally was used as income-producing property. The court further upheld the finding that the taxpayers had failed to show that Amendment 373 was unconstitutional, as the amendment provided ascertainable standards to guide the taxing authorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city ordinance prohibited mobile homes in residential areas. The landowner first sought to place a mobile home on her property but the city denied her petition for a zoning exception. She then entered a contract to purchase a modular home. The modular home was prefabricated in two sections that would be hauled to her lot and joined together. The wheels and axles would then be removed. She sought a building permit for the modular home and the city again refused. The landowner then brought this action and the jury determined that her modular home was not a mobile home. The court held that she had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Pursuant to statute, the city had established a board of adjustment to hear zoning appeals. The landowner had failed to take her complaint to the board before filing the legal action.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 20-2-1 et seq. (1975) (the Act), unconstitutional. Petitioner contended the Act must fall either because it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, or in its application to petitioner, as it failed to accord with the notice requirements of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was found guilty of possessing codeine, Talwin (pentazocine), chlorazepate, and d-amphetamine sulphate. Petitioner contended that Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-20 (1975) unlawfully delegated to the board of health the legislative authority to establish a criminal offense because that section authorized the board to schedule controlled substances, either through its own action or by adoption under federal law. The court held that it was the legislative will, not the board's, that, following a controlled classification, possession of that controlled substance constituted a crime. The federal decision to classify a drug as a controlled substance was subject to codified objective standards, and published findings and rules. Section &sect; 20-2-20(d) enabled the board to adopt federal procedures rather than having to duplicate them. However, minutes of the board showed that the procedures outlined by the legislature in &sect; 20-2-20(a), (b) were not followed when it classified Talwin as a controlled substance. That classification could not have constituted the basis for the charge under count two of the indictment, and thus petitioner could not have been found guilty under that count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's conviction under count two was reversed and the cause was remanded to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It decided that the immunity test under Ala.

The court also agreed with the trial court's rejection of appellants' argument that the employees were contributorily negligent. Further, the court held that the causes, with one exception, were to have been remanded for a new trial on the issue of damages only because the amounts awarded were not justified by the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of (1) grand larceny, with respect to a heat pump; and (2) buying, receiving, and concealing said pump. In affirming his conviction, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals rejected defendant's claim that because he was subjected to two trials for the offenses, his federal and state constitutional right to double jeopardy was violated. Defendant challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original indictment charged defendant with the theft of a heat pump from a church, listing the serial number therefor. During the course of the State's testimony at his first trial, the prosecution realized that two heat pumps had been stolen from the church and that the one recovered had its serial number removed. Because defendant refused to consent to an amendment of the indictment striking the serial number, the State obtained a dismissal of the prosecution under Ala. Code &sect; 15-8-91 (1975). The instant conviction resulted from defendant's trial after he was re-indicted. Addressing defendant's claim that his conviction violated double jeopardy, the court ruled that because the jury had been impaneled and sworn in the first trial, jeopardy had attached. However, if the State could show a manifest necessity for terminating the first trial, the second trial would not be prohibited. Because it found that the variance between the original indictment and the evidence at the first trial was not material, the court concluded that manifest necessity did not justify terminating the first trial, and thus, the judgment rendered as a result of the second trial could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that defendant's conviction violated double jeopardy, the court reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case to it for a decision consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The title holders filed an action to quiet title to some 10,000 acres of land which they had obtained through tax sales and other conveyances. The title holders identified 83 corporations and individuals whom they believed had claims against the lands and proceeded under the provisions of the Grove Act, now codified at Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-560, et seq. The circuit court granted the quiet title decree in 1943. All of the defendants were served by registered mail, personal service, or publication, and included appellants' predecessors in title. Thirty-five years later, the successors purported to execute mineral leases to others in the land. The title holders filed a motion to show cause, which sought to enforce the circuit court's prior decree. The circuit court denied appellants' requests for discovery, found that the title holders held the title, and found that appellants had no interest in the property. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree because appellants had no right to collaterally attack the original quiet title decree. The 1943 decree was regular on its face, indicated subject matter and personal jurisdiction, and was conclusive against collateral attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree of the circuit court, which enforced its decree that quieted title in real estate in favor of the real estate title holders, and dismissed the collateral attack on the quiet title decree.</SPAN></P>

Code 659, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Until Act 659 was enacted, the customary practice for securing approval of wastewater disposal systems was first to obtain approval from the county board and then the county board's approval would be forwarded to the state board for concurrence. However, after Act 659 was enacted, only county board approval was required. The state board attempted to compel the county board to revert to the prior practice, which prompted the homebuilders association to file an action for a declaratory judgment that Act 659 gave the county board exclusive jurisdiction over approval. The trial court so ordered, and the state board appealed. The court affirmed. Act 659, like all legislative enactments, was presumed constitutional. Further, because Act 659 was a reflection of a response to local needs it did not violate the prohibition under Ala. Const. &sect; 105 against special treatment by local law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the lender on the borrower's counterclaim. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In reaching its decision, the court first considered the plain language of &sect; 5-19-03. The court concluded that the maximum finance charge section of &sect; 5-19-3 was applicable not only to consumer loans, but also to non-consumer loans . The court held that &sect; 5-19-3 applied to the transaction between the borrower and the lender and, thus, concluded that the lender's interest rate was not usurious.

The damages were assessed at $ 240,000. The lessee appealed its award of $ 19,500 and the lessor appealed the award of $ 6,000 to the sole proprietor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole proprietor had a lease with an original term of five years from 1950 to 1955, with a right to hold over for five consecutive periods. At the end of the original term, the sole proprietor continued to hold over for successive five-year terms until the property was condemned. The lessor asserted that the sole proprietor was not entitled to a portion of the award because the lease was one for 30 years. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 35-4-6 (1975), a lease over 20 years had to be recorded as a conveyance. The court affirmed the sole proprietor's award, holding that the holdover provision in the lease existed for the benefit of the lessor, who could have terminated the lease on any fifth anniversary. As such, the term of the lease did not exceed 20 years so as to require recordation. The court also affirmed the award to the lessee, holding that an award to the lessee on the basis of the leasehold's &quot;highest and best use&quot; was improper because it would have amounted to the lessor's paying the lessee a sum higher than the lessee's interest in the total award.

The complaint specifically disclaimed any cause of action for punitive damages and sought only compensatory damages. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the administratrix appealed. The court affirmed, based on its own precedent, which had construed Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-410 (1975) as permitting the recovery of only punitive damages. The court had construed the statute as one intended to punish and prevent homicides. Even though the damages were paid to the decedent's estate, the purpose was to punish, not to compensate. The court noted that the legislature had re-enacted the statute since the court had given it that construction, thereby implicitly agreeing with the court's interpretation.</SPAN></P>

The act also compelled financial disclosure on the part of the spouses and dependents of persons primarily subject to the act. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment and held that in light of the legitimate state interests fostered by the act that the disclosures required in the instant case did not violate the United States Constitution by impinging on the employees' financial privacy. Also, Ala. Code &sect; 36-25-1(9) applying only to those public employees who earned more than $ 15,000 annually did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution or the Alabama Constitution because the means chosen by the legislature were rationally related to its legitimate purpose deterring actual corruption and avoiding the appearance of corruption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment creditor obtained a judgment against the judgment debtor, a state employee. The judgment creditor initiated an action to garnish the wages of the judgment debtor pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-480 et seq. The garnishee denied assent and asserted that &sect; 6-6-480 et seq. was unconstitutional and void under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The trial court discharged the process of garnishment because of the constitutional state immunity. The garnishee asserted additionally that the garnishment statute vested absolute authority in the garnishee, so that he could refuse to assent for any reason or no reason and the administrative expense of allowing a garnishment was reasonable cause of denying assent. The court reversed and remanded the decision that &sect; 6-6-480 et seq. was unconstitutional because the garnishment was effectively the payment of a debt to another party so that the state was not subject to litigation in any state but merely directed to pay a lawful debt to another. The court also held that a state official could refuse assent and consent to a garnishment under &sect; 6-6-483 only for good and reasonable cause, which did not include saving administrative costs.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the statute was constitutional. The statute did not violate Ala.

The distributors appealed. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the order deprived the distributors of their property, money, in a manner that was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court found that the distributors' money was taken by the Commission to be paid to the producers for milk presently or subsequently received but never used in making the buttermilk. Although the money taken was designed as &quot;compensatory payments,&quot; the court concluded that the payments were effectively a tax or penalty for the benefit of the producers and against the distributors for the distributors' use of milk powder.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 40-8-1 (1975), the taxpayers, who were citizens of the county, were required to pay a higher rate of ad valorem tax on the same class of property than citizens in other counties. The taxpayers filed a class action challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 40-8-1, asserting that the assessment violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court granted the county's motion to dismiss and denied the taxpayers' motion for partial summary judgment, holding that &sect; 40-8-1 did not violate equal protection in light of precedent allowing for assessments in the county to be different than assessments in other counties. The court reversed, holding that, as a matter of law, it could not find that the classification made in &sect; 40-8-1 was rational. The record provided no evidence as to whether the basis for the classification was rational or not, therefore, further proceedings were necessary. The court noted that, although distinctions based on geographical areas were not, in and of themselves, violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, the county was required to demonstrate that the classification was neither capricious nor arbitrary but rested upon some reasonable consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, state janitorial and lunchroom personnel (employees), sought recovery as a class from defendants, state board of education, its individual members, and its superintendent (board), for their failure to insure that the employees received a statutory raise and for improperly granting the superintendent a raise. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) denied class certification and dismissed the complaint. The employees sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees claimed that their complaint was improperly dismissed. The court rejected this claim in part and accepted it in part. The court affirmed the dismissal of the action concerning the raise granted to the superintendent. However, the court reversed and remanded the action involving the employees' raise claim. The court held that dismissal of the employees' raise claim was effectively a grant of summary judgment and that the board failed to carry its burden of proof. The court found that the lower court did not identify the considerations for this dismissal. The court further found that the evidence presented did not negate the inference that, through some administrative decision of the board, the employees were prevented from receiving the pay raises authorized by the legislature. The court held that more facts were necessary before a proper judgment could be rendered on this matter. However, the court affirmed the dismissal of the claim that the superintendent was wrongfully granted a pay raise. The court held that the superintendent was not an officer subject to the restrictions of Ala. Const. &sect; 281 and amend. 92, and thus, this claim was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Acts, did not violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments or the Alabama Constitution on its face although it allowed grants to students attending sectarian colleges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act No. 90 allowed grants to students attending private colleges, including sectarian ones. On appeal, the court applied a tripartite test to determine the constitutionality of the act under the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court found first that the statute had the secular legislative purpose of narrowing the gap between public and private schools to allow students true economic and academic freedom of choice; second, that its principal or primary effect was not to either advance or inhibit religion because Act No. 90 was not pervasively sectarian and merely made benefits neutrally available to all; and, finally, that the statute did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion because it was a college level program and did not aid true sectarian programs. The court found that Act. No. 90 did not violate Ala. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 263 because it did not appropriate money, the grants were made to students, not schools, and there was a ban on sectarian uses. The court held that Act No. 90 did not require a two-thirds vote under Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 73 because it did not appropriate any money.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the student grant program was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that they were designated by an ecclesiastical authority as the true congregation of their church and were thus entitled to the sole direction and control of the church's property.

Reversing the judgment, the court ruled that the ecclesiastical authority's decision, which revoked the permission that was given to the church to withdraw from the national church organization, was not binding on the court because the principal issue, the composition of the church's corporate structure, was not ecclesiastical in nature. The court noted that civil courts had the right to decide disputes involving church property and there was no need to decide any controversy involving religious doctrine or practice. The court held that plaintiffs were estopped from asserting any right to control the church corporation and its property because they did not follow the remedies provided by the national church organization to challenge the permission that was given to the church to withdraw.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that, while the ultimate test on appeal was whether the trial court abused its discretion, its application had to find its source in the initial issues presented to the trial court and the principal issue was the constitutional validity of a challenged portion of a statute. The court stated that on a motion for preliminary injunction, the burden was on the complainant to satisfy the court that there was at least a reasonable probability of ultimate success on the merits of the controversy. The court failed to find any plain and palpable error here, nor manifest injustice, and did not think it is apparent that the boards of trustees had no possibility of prevailing on the merits.

On remand, the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) had determined that the felony-murder doctrine had not been used to supply the requisite intent under Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-2(a)(2), the capital felony statute, and affirmed the prisoner's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was charged with felony murder for the death of a pawn shop owner. Against his counsel's advice, the prisoner pled guilty. After the prisoner entered his plea, the trial court set a jury trial as to sentencing. At trial, the prisoner admitted that he would have shot the victim if his accomplice had not been in the line of fire. The prisoner did not object to the jury charge. The jury recommended death. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court remanded. The appellate court again affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. An accomplice in a capital felony could be sentenced to death because the statute included accomplice liability as a factor to be considered during the sentencing hearing under both aggravating circumstances, &sect; 13-11-6(4), and mitigating circumstances, &sect; 13-11-7(4). The significant distinction between use of the felony-murder doctrine and use of accomplice liability was that accomplice liability required a greater showing of a defendant's individual intent. Felony murder had not been used at trial. The trial court had relied on accomplice liability. The prisoner waived any objection to the jury charge as to robbery or accomplice liability.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment for appellees and declared the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly determined that the statute was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily imposed the burden of providing a public service on private employers. The court further held that the classification bore no relation to a legitimate end. The court also held that the statute unconstitutionally impaired the parties' employment contracts because it mandated the payment of the National Guard and Reserve members even if the employer's employment policy differed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate filed with the Democratic party his qualifying papers for that party's nomination for governor. The Commission required candidates in primary elections to file statements of economic interests within 10 days of qualifying as a candidate, as required by Ala. Code &sect; 36-25-15 (1975). The candidate filed the required forms under protest and instituted this action seeking injunctive relief. The candidate asked the trial court to return the material to him. The candidate claimed that the disclosure requirements did not apply to him because he was only a candidate for his party's nomination and not the state Democratic candidate. The court did affirmed. The court held that: (1) &sect; 36-25-15 applied to the candidate even though he did not win his party's nomination for governor; and (2) when the candidate filed his declaration of candidacy with the state party chairman and qualified for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, he became a &quot;candidate for public office&quot; under the provisions of the Alabama Ethics Law, and he had to publicly disclose his private interests within 10 days after becoming a candidate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant industries sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, Montgomery County (Alabama), which upheld the constitutionality of the Prison-Made Goods Act of Alabama. The industries contended that the act was unconstitutional because it established a competitive business enterprise that could potentially yield revenue or profit to appellee State and because the act was overbroad in going beyond the subject expressed in its title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the industries' contention that the Prison-Made Goods Act of Alabama violated the state constitution by placing the State in competition with private industry in violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 93. The act's primary objective was to provide vocational training and rehabilitation to prisoners, and the court found that the employment of prison inmates in such vocational and rehabilitative pursuits was related to public safety and welfare and was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power. Any profit was a secondary consideration, and the act's primary purpose was well within the State's police power. The court found that public bidding requirements in Ala. Const. &sect; 69 did not circumscribe the State's police power or preclude prison industries from performing services for state agencies. The court also found that the act did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 45 by going beyond the subject matter of its title, which clearly expressed the act's general subject of rehabilitation of inmates and financing through the sale of products. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the act's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, determining that the putative illegitimate daughter did not meet her burden of proving any of the three ways in which a child born out of wedlock may inherit from her intestate father, short of being adopted by the father, under Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-11-1, 26-11-2, and 26-12-1 et seq.

After the state legislature increased the salaries of state troopers, the county deputies sought a similar increase but were denied. The court affirmed the judgment granting the county deputies' petition for mandamus. The local acts were all general reference statutes that did not specifically refer to any statute setting trooper salaries but merely stated that compensation for the county deputies shall be comparable to state troopers' compensation. The local acts, as amended, automatically carried with them the subsequent modifications to the law governing state trooper salaries. The effect of the local acts was that each time the legislature raised the compensation of the state troopers, that of the county deputies was increased automatically. The county deputies were not entitled to attorneys' fees because state attorneys' fees were recoverable only where authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-5-410 (1975). The trial court denied her motion to amend her complaint to substitute a named party under Ala. R. Civ. P. 9(h) because the party's name was known within the two-year recovery period. The court affirmed, finding that (1) the administratrix took the party's deposition well in advance of the expiration of the two-year recovery period; (2) in his the deposition, the party revealed sufficient facts from which the administratrix could have decided to bring a claim against him; (3) because she knew the party's identity and had a sufficient factual basis to bring a claim, the administratrix was barred from claiming ignorance under Rule 9(h); (4) an intervening decision that an act immunizing co-employees from liability was unconstitutional did not affect her claim because the administratrix could have challenged the constitutionality of the law herself; and (5) the claim was not saved by Ala.

Code &sect;&sect; 15-12-2 and 15-12-3, the judge entered an order establishing an indigent defense system for the circuit. The order provided that attorneys were appointed to teams and each team would be eligible for appointment to represent indigent defendants during three months per year. The trial court denied the attorney's motion to vacate the order. The attorney then filed a petition for mandamus or appeal contending that the system was unconstitutional because it provided little pay for the attorneys so that defendants would not receive adequate representation. The court denied the mandamus petition and affirmed the decision denying the attorney's motion to vacate. The court found that there was no evidence suggesting that defendants would be denied adequate representation because their attorneys were underpaid. The court held that attorneys had a duty to adequately represent all clients and money did not have to be a motivating factor for such representation. The court concluded that attorneys should not be relieved of the duty to provide representation for indigent defendants based upon lack of monetary rewards.</SPAN></P>

However, none of the false information was linked to the city. The lower court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of the city, holding that the contiguous area was properly annexed to the city. Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Ala.

Code &sect;&sect; 11-47-23, -192, when the patient sought to bring a negligence action against the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, born prematurely, suffered injuries allegedly due to the negligence of a nurse at a city run hospital. However, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city after determining that the patient failed to file a notice of the tort claim with the city within six months of the accrual of the action. As a result, the patient argued that he was denied equal protection of the law, that the statutes denied due process to a minor who was unable to comply with them, and that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-482(b) should have given the patient additional time to file a malpractice suit. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the city. Specifically, regarding the equal protection challenge, the court held that the limitations upon the patient's right to bring claims against the city, when uniformly and equally applied, were constitutional. Secondly, regarding the denial of due process, the court held that neither Ala. Code &sect; 11-47-23 nor Ala. Code &sect; 11-47-192 contained exemptions for minors. Lastly, the court held that it declined to graft the extended time period of Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-482(b) onto Ala. Code &sect; 11-47-23.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death following his conviction for robbery when the victim was intentionally killed. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision. On further appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Alabama Death Penalty Act and found that the prosecutor did not make prejudicial statements by commenting on the need for deterrence. Such argument was proper where the prosecutor did not imply that defendant himself would commit other illegal acts. The trial court improperly considered the same aggravating factor twice by concluding that defendant committed a capital felony during a robbery and a capital felony for pecuniary gain based on the fact that he stole money from the victim. The court also held that the trial judge improperly considered the crime as charged, rather than the lesser crime for which defendant was found guilty. The finding that defendant lacked a significant criminal history should have operated in his favor, and the trial court erred by considering prior criminal activity which did not rise to the level of &quot;significant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were injured on the job and each claimed in their action for damages that their injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of a co-employee. In each case the complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because amendments to the Alabama Workmen's Compensation Act, Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11, barred negligence actions for damages by an injured employee against his or her co-employees. On appeal, the court held that Ala. Const. &sect; 13 limited the power of the legislature to enact amendments to the Act barring such actions. The court stated that the Act was a voluntary substitute for the common law and other statutory rights of action for personal injuries against an employer applicable to those who elected to come within its provisions. The elective option was solely between employer and employee. The court found that employees retained their rights to sue third parties, including co-employees. The court concluded that to hold that the legislature could include a co-employee's negligent act within the provisions of the Act, thus immunizing him from suit by an injured employee would be to say that the co-employee was an employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought a suit against his supervisor for breach of contract and fraud. Both parties were employees of the state university, which was immune from suit under Ala. Const. &sect; 14. The employee alleged that the supervisor agreed to hire him at a certain salary and work load per week, and that the supervisor breached the agreement by requiring the employee to work longer hours without compensation. The supervisor filed a motion to dismiss and argued that at no time was there any agreement that he would be responsible for the employee's salary. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the supervisor and the employee appealed. The court affirmed and held that the supervisor was an agent of the university and a suit seeking money damages for breach of contract came within the prohibition of the state constitution as a suit against the state. The court reversed however as to the claim of fraud, since it was alleged that the supervisor had acted outside his authority while committing fraud and therefore a material issue of fact was raised by the employee on that claim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court permanently enjoined the repairman from using such term with regard to his business. The court modified and affirmed the judgment. The court found that the repairman was not a registered engineer and had never been engaged in the practice of engineering. The court held that Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect; 128(1) et seq., per se, condemned utilization of the term &quot;engineering&quot; in the repairman's trade name, even without the presence of the modifying term &quot;professional.&quot; The court noted that &quot;engineer&quot; and &quot;professional engineer&quot; were defined in the same terms and were used interchangeably.

Pursuant to a jury verdict, the trial court (Alabama) granted judgment for the mother, declared that the father the was the father of the mother's illegitimate child, and ordered the father to pay child support. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that he was denied equal protection of the laws because the mother did not consent to have an abortion, at his request and expense, and that he was denied any decision about the child's birth. The court affirmed. The court held that the father, as an unmarried man, could not unilaterally require the mother, his unmarried paramour, to abort the fetus he fathered. The court further held that the father was liable for the child's support after the child's birth even if he could not require the mother to abort. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 12-4 (1940), once a reputed father of an illegitimate child was adjudged as father, he was liable for the care, maintenance, and education of the child, the same as a father of a legitimate child. The father of a legitimate child could not forsake his obligations to his child just because his wife failed to honor his request to abort the fetus. The decision not to have an abortion was that of the mother and, by not having one at the request of the father, he could not shirk his statutory obligations to the child.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 205-23, the Dairy Commission Act, to fix prices of fluid milk at the producer, wholesale, and retail levels as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission filed a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) and injunction against the distributor for selling milk in violation of a regulation passed pursuant to the Act; the circuit court granted the TRO, the Commission rescinded its regulation, and the circuit court ruled in favor of the distributor's counterclaim. On review, the court found that the Act, which delegated the legislature's regulatory power to the Commission, was constitutional because it was not expressly prohibited by the Constitution and did not violate due process. The court found that regulation of milk was authorized under the State's police power, was reasonably related to accomplishing a purpose within the scope of its police power, and that price fixing was part of that power. The court reversed the decision and ruled that the United States Constitution was not offended by the Act and that it did not place an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce because it applied to both in-state and out-of-state distributors and suppliers with the same regulations.</SPAN></P>

The judgment also declared that the taxpayer could exclude the state sales tax from the calculation of gross receipts under the city license code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed back license taxes against the taxpayer because the taxpayer deducted from its gross receipts, on which the city business license was computed, the state sales tax imposed by Ala. Code tit. 51, art. 9 (1940). The taxpayer brought a declaratory judgment action against the city to construe the city license code, Birmingham, Ala., Code &sect; 4(a). The city claimed that the taxpayer could only exempt from gross receipts the sales tax paid under Ala. Code. tit. 51, art. 10 (1940). The trial court rendered judgment on the pleadings for the taxpayer, and the city appealed. The court reversed. The crucial issue presented was whether the city license code excepted the sales tax on tobacco imposed by Ala. Code tit. 51, art. 9 (1940) from gross receipts. The court concluded that the language was plain and unambiguous and that its expressed intent was that only the Alabama sales tax as provided in Ala. Code tit. 51, art. 10 (1940) was excepted from gross receipts. It further held that the license code was not unconstitutional. The class composed of wholesale tobacco merchants was not denied equal protection of laws because the class as a whole was treated alike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment on the pleadings in favor of the taxpayer in an action to construe a city license code.

The mother had been joined by the insurers as an additional party in an interpleader action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and the mother were divorced. Their three children were killed in an automobile accident while passengers in a car owned and operated by an uninsured motorist. Under the divorce decree, the father had custody of two of the deceased children, and the mother had custody of the other child. The father owned two automobiles, which were insured by different insurers. He filed an action against the insurers, who admitted liability up to the policy limits for the two children living with the father. The insurers joined the mother as an additional party, and the trial court granted summary judgment to the father. In affirming, the court held the father had the primary duty to support the minor children and he was therefore entitled to any damages recovered as a result of injury to or death of a minor child under the provisions of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 6-5-390, 391 (1975). Moreover, Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-390 (1975) did not violate equal protection because it was based on the legislature's recognition that the father had the primary duty to support his minor children. The continuing obligation of support gave the father the priority in receiving any damages for the injury or death of a child.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 660 (1958).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each plaintiff filed a separate tort action against the city, and each action was dismissed pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 660 (1958). Section 660 provided governmental immunity for certain acts only to cities with a minimum population classification of 100,000. On appeal, plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 660. The court held that &sect; 660 was unconstitutional under both the federal and state constitutions. The statute violated the equal protection principle, and because of its unreasonable population classification, it could not qualify as a general law of local application. The court also found that the Alabama Constitution authorized local legislation and set out a procedure for its enactment. Under that authorization local legislation reflecting responses to local needs could be enacted. It was only when those local needs already had been responded to by general legislation that &sect; 105 of the state constitution prohibited special treatment by local law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the landlord purchased the farm, the tenant was renting a house on it from the previous owner. The landlord and the tenant entered into an agreement whereby the tenant agreed to perform various services in exchange for rent. Approximately three years later, the landlord filed an unlawful detainer action. The tenant filed a counterclaim for the conveyance of land allegedly promised by the landlord, damages for misrepresentation and deceit, and wages. After a trial, the circuit court entered a judgment for: (1) the landlord on the lands described in the complaint; and (2) the tenant for $ 12,000 on his counterclaim for wages. The landlord appealed the judgment on the counterclaim. The court affirmed the decision. It determined that: (1) the landlord waived the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations because he did not raise it until six days after the trial and none of the exceptions to the waiver rule applied; and (2) the evidence justified the amount of damages awarded to the tenant.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 1567(a14) of 1973 Ala. Acts 1272.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ala. Code &sect; 1567(a14) limited the application of Ala. Code &sect; 450(4) by excluding cities with populations of 250,000 or more from extraordinary disability allowances, payable as a result of accident arising out of the course of employment when disability was based upon heart disease or hypertension. Thus, if a fireman in a smaller city contracted heart disease and became disabled, his municipal pension system must have treated him as having become disabled in line of duty and compensated him as though he had been injured in line of duty. In the City of Birmingham, however, his heart disease was not to be considered as an accident sustained in the course of his duty. The court determined that there were no substantial distinctions perceptible between the firemen in the cities covered and those in all other cities. The grouping of Ala. Code &sect; 1567(a14), based upon a population classification, was arbitrary rather than reasonable in denying to Birmingham firemen those benefits which all other municipal firemen statutorily received. Thus the court held that 1973 Ala. Act 1272, as it applied to firemen, violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

Only the individual named appellees had standing to bring the suit because the act did not apply to cities, boards, or similar entities. The act clearly specified the public officials that fell with the governance of the act. Because prior case law had removed city and county officials, such as appellees, from the category of public officials subject to the act, appellees were correct in their argument that they were not subject to the act.</SPAN></P>

The State contended that the board member was disqualified by virtue of having held public office for several years preceding his election in violation of 1976 Ala. Acts 939. The board member had served as a member of a water and sewer board. The trial court determined that the board member had held public office by virtue of being a member of the water and sewer board and thus was disqualified to serve on the personnel board. In affirming on appeal, the court held that: (1) because the water and sewer board was a corporation organized by law to perform as an agency of a municipality and its functions were governmental, its members were public officers, and therefore, the board member was ineligible to hold his current office because of the restrictions contained in 1975 Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether a denial of a petition for reinstatement to the practice of medicine by the board was appealable to the court under Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect; 278 (1940) (1973 Supp.) The court held that the language of &sect; 278 contemplated an appeal to the court only from an order of the board suspending or revoking a certificate of qualification. The court held that an appeal from the board's denial of a petition for reinstatement to practice medicine would not lie. The court reasoned that the doctor could seek the writ of mandamus from the circuit court to obtain a review of the board's alleged abuse of discretion in denying his petition for reinstatement. The court found that the hearing before the board fell short of procedural due process requirements. The court granted the board's motion to dismiss because an appeal to the court was an inappropriate remedy for the doctor to seek relief by way of reinstatement to the practice of medicine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Birmingham passed a resolution of annexation and Homewood adopted an ordinance that annexed the same property. The corporations brought an action against Birmingham that contested their proposed annexation. In a separate action, Birmingham filed an action that contested the legality of the Homewood annexation. The court reversed the trial court's judgment that upheld Birmingham's annexation ordinance because Homewood was an indispensable party pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. P. 19 who was absent from the litigation. The factors that were used to determine whether a party was indispensable was whether a decision against it might be prejudicial; the extent to which by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice could be lessened or avoided; whether a judgment rendered in the party's absence will be adequate; and whether the plaintiff had an adequate remedy if the action was dismissed for nonjoinder. A judgment in favor of Birmingham in the corporation's case was inadequate because of the absence of Homewood. When two simultaneous actions were ongoing in reference to the same subject matter, conflicting results could easily happen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees argued that they were not &quot;public officials&quot; and thus not subject to the provisions of the State Ethics Act (act). Appellees further averred that appellants' attempt to apply the provisions of the act to them violated the &quot;separation of powers&quot; clauses of the Alabama Constitution. Appellants were subsequently enjoined from taking any action to apply any of the act's provisions against appellees or their successors in office solely by reason of their service as members of these entities. Appellants argued that this placed appellees above the law and made them immune from compliance with ethical standards. The court rejected that argument and affirmed the injunction. The court did not reach the constitutional issue because it found that that appellees were not &quot;public officials&quot; as defined by &sect; 2(k) of the act. They were not elected nor appointed, nor did they have administrative and discretionary authority for the receipt or expenditure of public funds. Also, those appellees who were attorneys were subject to the Code of Professional Responsibility, the judges were bound by the Canons of Judicial Ethics, and all were bound to obey the law or suffer the consequences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought an action against the driver for the wrongful death of her child. She alleged that she was divorced from the child's father and that the father did not make reasonable monthly support payments or exercise his visitation rights. The plain intendment of her allegations was to place her within the standing of a mother to maintain an action for wrongful death.The driver moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the father was the proper party-plaintiff. The motion was denied. The father appealed.The court held that a genuine issue of material fact was presented on the issue of desertion, and it was error, therefore, for the trial court to deny the driver's motion to dismiss which was tantamount to a summary judgment on that issue. Evidence of the father's gifts to the child, together with his reasons for his reduced visitations, placed in issue the question of any settled purpose on his part to abandon his parental duties. Whether the amount the father paid comported with the support agreement with the mother, or was so insufficient as to constitute abandonment of his parental duties, was a disputed matter upon which reasonable persons might have disagreed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order, which denied the driver's motion to dismiss, and remanded the case to the trial court in order to allow the driver to join the father as a party-plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that &sect; 319 did not provide for individualized sentencing after review of the character and record of the particular defendant and after examination of the circumstances of the particular case.

The trial court granted summary judgment for the dependents. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that an active member could retire and receive a &quot;retirement allowance&quot; or an &quot;optional benefit in lieu thereof.&quot; Because the member selected the maximum benefit allowance, the statute specifically provided that the payments were &quot;for life.&quot; They ceased at death, regardless of whether the fund had paid out all of the member's contributions.

The trial court granted the decree, declaring the ordinance invalid and unconstitutional. On the city's appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An original judgment granting the buyer specific performance was reversed based on the finding that the seller husband had signed the agreement only as a witness and had not evidenced his assent to the sale pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 34, &sect; 73. The sellers were then granted summary judgment. However, during the pendency of the appeal, &sect; 73 was found unconstitutional and a married woman was no longer required to have her husband's signature evidencing his assent to a conveyance of land. Thus, the question of whether the seller husband signed the contract as a witness or as a husband, evidencing his assent to his wife's contract to convey her land, was rendered moot and the court reversed summary judgment for the sellers. The court further found that there were genuine issues of material fact that precluded summary judgment for the buyer, including an issue raised in the amended pleadings as to mutual mistake regarding the size of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Governor and the State of Alabama, and the Alabama Public Service Commission (commission) challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Alabama), which granted a 39 and one half million dollar annual rate increase to appellee telephone company, issued the company a writ of supersedeas, and remanded to the commission to establish a schedule of rates in accordance with a 9 percent overall rate of return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary of Defense and the Executive Offices of the United States government, who had intervened in the case, did not participate in the appeal. The commission had found the company's cost of debt to be 7.49 percent and that the appropriate debt-equity ratio was 45-55 percent. The commission had decided that an increase in the schedule of rates and charges which would allow the company $ 16,694.545 in additional annual revenue calculated on a 7.56 percent overall rate of return, was appropriate. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded with directions. The court rejected the company's argument that the rate ordered by the commission was too low and amounted to an unconstitutional confiscation vel non of the company's property. The court determined that the rate of return on equity as calculated by the commission was accurate and that the rate schedule ordered by the commission was reasonable and just within the meaning of Ala. Code tit. 48, &sect; 52. The court noted that the company's times-interest-charges ratio and rate of return on average equity for the test year of 1974 were higher than those of almost all comparable companies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee in the course of his employment. He sought to maintain a third-party negligence action against defendants for personal injury. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that because the injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment, defendants were not third-party tortfeasors against whom an action could be maintained under &sect; 312. The employee offered evidence that the amendment contained a clerical error and failed to achieve hits alleged purpose of deleting the prohibition against third-party actions. Reversing denial of summary judgment, the court found that legislative journals failed to show that &sect; 312 should not have been in the enrolled bill as passed by the legislature and signed by the governor. The court held that the bill signed by the legislature and approved by the governor was not materially variant from the bill passed. In the absence of a material variance the court could not find any portion of it constitutionally invalid. The court found that it could not have engaged in a collateral attack of looking beyond the enrolled bill and legislative journals in order to establish an ambiguity requiring a construction of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that the deed from an original property owner to the state be construed to reflect that the state had acquired only a right-of-way or easement; that the property owners were the fee simple owners of all the oil, gas and minerals in said property; that Ala. Code tit. 19, &sect;&sect; 1 et seq., be construed so as to permit the state in the exercise of eminent domain to acquire only so much of an estate as may be reasonably necessary; and the same statute was unconstitutional insofar as it permitted the acquisition of a fee simple title. The lower court granted the motion to dismiss filed by the state, the state officials, and the oil company. The court reversed the dismissal as to the state officials and the oil company but determined that dismissal as to the state was proper because the state was immune. The court found that under Ala. Const. Art. 1, &sect; 14 (1901) the state was immune from this action because it involved land in which the state had a definite right or interest and the decree rendered would bind the state and could not be maintained without the state's consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central issue was the constitutionality of Ala. Code tit. 34 &sect; 73, which denied a wife the power of alienating or mortgaging her lands without the assent and concurrence of her husband. The seller's husband refused to join in a conveyance to the purchaser for the sale property. The court stated that to hold that all conveyances of a wife's land, or any interest therein, must, to be valid, carry the signature of her husband, was to deny to a married woman rights which were freely exercised by every other adult person, male or female, in Alabama. To justify such a holding on the legal presumption that all married women were incapable of dealing with their own land, without the guidance of their husbands, was to ignore the realities of life. The court held that &sect; 73, limiting the freedom of a married woman to alienate or mortgage her lands, or any interest therein, without the assent and concurrence of her husband, violated the provisions of the constitution, in that it denied to that category of adult landowners rights guaranteed to all other adult landowners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to enjoin the State comptroller from making payments from public funds to retired Governors under the authority of Act. No. 343 of the Regular Session of the Legislature, on grounds that the Act contravened Ala. Const. &sect; 98, which provided that the Legislature could not retire any officer on pay, or part pay, or make any grant to a retiring officer. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment enjoining the comptroller and concluded that the taxpayers had standing to attack the constitutionality of the Act since taxpayers could resort to a court of equity to prevent the misapplication of public funds. The taxpayers' right to challenge the Act's constitutionality was based on their equitable ownership of tax funds and their liability to replenish the treasury for deficiencies caused by misappropriations. In construing the provisions of the Alabama Constitution, the court looked to the debates of the constitutional convention and found that &sect; 98 was meant to prohibit the Legislature from granting a public officer, including a retiring Governor, retirement funds upon his becoming eligible after leaving office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal challenged the constitutionality of the juvenile transfer of jurisdiction statute, Ala. Code tit. 13, &sect; 364. The court ruled that the State was required to determine whether it wanted to treat a juvenile within the juvenile court system before entering upon a proceeding that may result in an adjudication that he had violated a criminal law. The review of the record did not show that either the juvenile court or the circuit court made an adjudicatory finding that defendant was delinquent because he had committed the offense of assault with intent to ravish. If, in fact, there was an adjudication of delinquency on the charge that did not appear of record, defendant could have filed a plea of double jeopardy in the trial on the criminal charge, as has been done previously. Nothing foreclosed the State from requiring, as a prerequisite to the transfer of defendant, substantial evidence that he committed the offense charged, so long as the showing required was not made in an adjudicatory proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court determined that 1975 Ala.

On appeal, the court reversed the decision in part and affirmed in part. The court reversed the declaration that the Act was unconstitutional in its entirety and found that only two sections of the Act were unconstitutional. The court held the bar to commissioners ever serving again violated the Equal Protection Act, and the provision that applied the Act to towns of more than 15,000 employees bore no rational relationship to the purposes of the Act. The court further found that the two unconstitutional parts could be stricken from the Act and the remainder enforced.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 7, &sect; 123 (1940) (Recompiled 1958). The administratrix had alleged that the decedent died as a result of the city's negligence in causing a defect in a public street.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decomposed bodies of the decedent and the driver of an automobile were found inside the automobile in the waters of a lake near the public street. The administratrix alleged that the city negligently failed to maintain suitable barriers to warn motorists. The city claimed that the administratrix failed to file a claim within six months of the accrual of the action under Ala. Code tit. 37, &sect; 476 (1940) (Recompiled 1958) of the Act, and failed to state substantially details regarding the accident under Ala. Code tit. 37, &sect; 504 (1940) (Recompiled 1958) of the Act. On appeal, the administratrix alleged error by the trial court in granting the city's motion, and alternatively attacked the constitutionality of these two provisions of the Act. Construing tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 476 and 504 in pari material, the court held that: (1) the statute of limitations began to run when the cause accrued; (2) the cause accrued as soon as the administratrix was entitled to maintain an action; and (3) the date that the administratrix filed the claim, which necessarily followed her appointment as administratrix, was within six months from the date of accrual. Therefore, summary judgment was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the granting of summary judgment in favor of the city and against the administratrix, and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer contracted with the contractor to build a shopping center. The contract called for periodic progress payments and a final payment due 30 days after substantial completion. A final statement was sent to the developer and the developer notified the contractor that it was financially unable to pay the bill, but offered to give the contractor a promissory note. On appeal, the court held that the mechanic's lien statute was constitutional as it applied to realty cases. The court held that the statute provided notice, an opportunity to be heard, and the filing of a notice of a lien did not dispossess the owner of the property. The court held that the bill of complain was sufficient because it alleged that the lien was claimed on property which was described, that notice had been filed in the probate judge's office, that the lien was based upon a written contract for the construction of buildings on the described property, and the lien was for the unpaid balance due under the contract. The court held that the evidence of the case showed that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county maintained that the polestar of statutory construction was that the intention of the legislature had to be given effect. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that basic to each rule of legislative construction, unless a challenged act was constitutionally offensive, was the intent of the legislature. Further, the court found that the legislature unquestionably had the right to permissively authorize counties and municipalities to establish and maintain waste disposal systems and to regulate through the state department of health the methodology employed by those counties and municipalities electing to exercise such authority. Because it was within the legislature's prerogative to permissively or mandatorily authorize counties and municipalities to establish waste disposal systems, words had to be given their usual and customary permissive meaning unless a contrary meaning was manifest from the content and spirit of the Solid Wastes Disposal Act (Act), Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 345-351, as a whole. Thus, the court concluded that a permissive interpretation of &sect; 347(a) of the Act appeared consistent with the legislative intent.</SPAN></P>

The legislation also limited the term for which such contracts were to be made, prescribed certain stipulations that had to be made in such contracts, and declared that the entering of such contracts would not constitute the incurring of a debt within the constitutional provision or statutory limitation on debts of the county and municipality. The most recent federal decennial census listed only one county in the state with a population between 75,000 and 90,000, which county had a population of 77,297. The court adopted the legislation as a local law, and not a general law, because the bill would not be applicable to other counties and municipalities where they would come within the population classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city proposed the annexation of a certain territory. Under the proposed annexation, the fire district would lose substantially all of its territory. Additionally, the municipality owned property in the territory sought to be annexed. The voters defeated the proposed annexation. However, the probate court changed the result in favor of the annexation. The circuit court set aside the election. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the city drew boundary lines for the purpose of preventing most of the voters who were going to vote &quot;no&quot; from voting on the issue at all. The lines prevented the great majority of the inhabitants of the annexed territory from voting, although the proposed city limits would encircle them either completely or substantially. Accordingly, the city's gerrymandering action was unreasonable. Moreover, the gerrymandering action was unconstitutional because the city's boundaries failed to meet the test of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Those excluded had a right to voice their opinion, especially when their interest was equal to that of their neighbors who were permitted to vote on the basis of the city's boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act in question dealt with compensation for the sheriff in certain counties. The trial court held that the Act was unconstitutional because it provided for different pay rates for sheriffs with law degrees and those without law degrees. The trial court also held the Act to be unconstitutional on other grounds. On review, the court held that the Act did not just apply to the one county at issue because as other counties grow in population they would fall under the Act. Therefore, the court determined that the Act was a general law because of the possibility that it could later apply to other counties. The court further held that the classification in the Act did not render it unconstitutional because both were reasonably related to the purpose of the Act, which was to provide more efficient administration of justice in large urban areas. The court additionally found that the Act did not intend for the Civil Service Act to be repealed. In reversing, the court reasoned that the Act only required the board to set a fixed salary for the sheriff if he did not have a law degree, which was constitutional and the other salaries were not affected by the Act.</SPAN></P>

In their amended complaint, the heirs-at-law sought a declaration that &sect; 460 was unconstitutional if applied to provide for the return of the decedent's contributions to the widow rather than his estate, which was designated as the beneficiary prior to the 1967 amendment to &sect; 460. In its subsequent judgment, the trial court found &sect; 460 was unconstitutional because it impaired the contractual obligation owed the estate as the designated beneficiary of the decedent's retirement benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment because the trial court correctly applied the law to the facts to find the widow was eligible for the $ 5,000 death benefit and the decedent's estate was eligible to receive all other contributions and accumulated interest thereon.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's decision granting summary judgment for the doctor. The court determined that the patient stated a claim for the tort of conspiracy and should have been allowed to proceed on that claim. The doctor had absolute immunity as to the negligence, libel, and false imprisonment counts because the statute for commitment placed the decision making power entirely within the sound discretion of the probate judge. The doctor was no more than a witness in the proceeding. However, the conspiracy count alleged something beyond the doctor's testimony in the commitment proceeding. The conspiracy count alleged that the doctor acted with another person to deprive the patient of his property. The patient could not recover damages from the doctor's allegedly perjured testimony. However, the patient could recover damages if he could prove that the doctor conspired to deprive the patient of his property. On remand, the patient had to prove that the doctor intended to cause the patient damage, acted with at least one other person, and engaged in an overt act.</SPAN></P>

IV(D), of limiting to three the number of times a person was permitted to take the exam. The lower court found the Act constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the finding. The court held that establishment of rules governing admission to the bar was a judicial function; under controlling precedent, it rested exclusively with the judiciary to determine who was qualified to become an attorney. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional because it was in direct conflict with Rule IV(D), promulgated by the board as an aid to the court, and by removing minimum standards established by the board, directly encroached upon the undisputed power of the court to determine who practiced before it.</SPAN></P>

The acts prohibited the sale of liquor except at state liquor stores. The state filed a quo warranto proceeding, asking that the club be enjoined from operating a drinking establishment. The trial court entered a judgment granting the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the club had no protected right of property in vending intoxicating liquor. The legislative power to regulate the sale of liquor was absolute and the legislature had the right to change the law at any time. That the club had been operating under a license from the city for several years did not estop the state from denying it a license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama Legislature (legislature) passed a resolution requesting the Supreme Court of Alabama to give an opinion regarding the constitutionality of portions of Senate Bill No. 862, which authorized joint or cooperative action by municipalities, electric boards, and cooperatives in the planning, financing, owning, operating, and developing of electrical power plants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature sought an advisory opinion from the court regarding a bill pertaining to joint action by municipalities and electric companies. The court determined that for the most part, the bill was constitutional. However, the provisions regarding eminent domain and immunity of municipal officers and employees violated Ala. Const. &sect; 45 (1901) because those provisions were not so clear that the average legislator or person reading the statute would understand the extent to which they applied. Further, the provisions regarding financing of new projects violated Ala. Const. amend. CVII because revenue bonds could only be used for the purpose of enlarging, extending, or improving existing systems. The remaining provisions of the bill, however, were found to be constitutional. The court found that the bill contained only one subject in accordance with Ala. Const. &sect; 42. The bill did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 94 because electric authorities were not political subdivisions of the state. The issuance of new bonds by a municipality without regard to limitation of indebtedness or an election of qualified voters did not violate Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 222, 225.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violations of the Alabama Worthless Check Act (Act), Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 234(9)-(21) (Recompiled 1958, Pocket Part). Defendant contended that the Act was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous, that its provisions were in conflict, and that it violated Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The lower appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction. On further appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Act. The court found no fatal conflict between the sections of the Act. The court ruled that the relationship between the facts proved and the prima facie presumption based upon such proven facts was sufficient to comply with constitutional standards. The court found that defendant made good the check, before it was presented for payment, by executing the note and delivering it to the payee of the check. The court held that it was error for the trial court to charge the jury that the bank's refusal to pay the check, which was the subject of the prosecution, was prima facie evidence of defendant's intent to defraud.</SPAN></P>

However, the court determined that while some courts had held their guest statutes to be unconstitutional, the Supreme Court had upheld the right of a state to pass a guest law. Further, the court determined that under the distribution of powers section of the state constitution, it was within the province of the legislature to ascertain and determine when the welfare of the people might require that the guest statute should be repealed. Additionally, the court determined that the legislature's power should not be interfered with unless it was exercised in a manner that plainly conflicted with some higher law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's husband's hand got stuck in a conveyor belt, which pulled him into the conveyor system and killed him while he was at work. The widow filed an action against the manufacturer alleging negligence in designing the equipment. The manufacturer contended that the statute of limitation barred the widow's action and the trial court granted its motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court held that in tort cases, the date from which the traditional statute of limitations began to run was the date upon which the cause of action accrued, normally the date the injury occurred. However, 1969 Ala. Acts 788 required that the action be commenced within four years after the final completion of such improvements and not afterwards. The court held that the Act was a radical departure from the traditional justification of statutes of limitations based upon a plaintiff's delay and that in tort actions, the Act was void for that infirmity. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the applicable statute of limitations was Title 7, Ala. Code &sect; 123.</SPAN></P>

The case arose from the city's implementation of the civil service system in the police department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought the class action in order to contest the city's implementation within the police department of the recently-enacted civil service system, which was set forth in 1971 Ala. Acts 2123. The circuit court dismissed the matter for failure to state a claim under Ala. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and because plaintiffs did not exhaust administrative remedies. On review, the court held that the circuit court properly declined relief under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, because plaintiffs failed to allege in the complaint prior resort to the agency legislatively charged with authority over the civil service system. The administrative review would have promoted uniformity and consistency in the application of the pertinent statutes, rules, and regulations, agency expertise was required, and initial agency review would have materially assisted the circuit court upon later review. The circuit court correctly weighed the need for initial agency review against the rights and needs of plaintiffs. The court affirmed the dismissal, based upon the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, coupled with plaintiffs' failure to respond to motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 15, &sect; 266 (1972) (Act), but he refused to waive his right to trial by jury. The court then ordered that he be tried as an adult and a jury found defendant guilty of selling marijuana. On appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) affirmed and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for unlawfully selling marijuana. At arraignment the trial court appointed counsel to represent defendant and advised him of his youthful offender rights under the Youthful Offender Act, Ala. Code tit. 15, &sect; 266 (1972). Defendant refused to waive his right to trial by jury, was convicted as an adult, and appealed. Defendant contended the Act was unconstitutional because of the jury waiver. The court held that the juvenile proceedings under the Act were not criminal in nature and therefore were not subject to the constitutional mandate of trial by jury. Also, the adjudicatory procedures defined by the Youthful Offender Act did not violate due process of law, and any benefits which might have resulted from the infusion of a jury trial into youthful offender proceedings were greatly outweighed by the detrimental effects it would have had to the orderly functioning of the youthful offender system and to the interests of those persons the Act was designed to protect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a county personnel board and its director, appealed a decision of an Alabama trial court, which entered a judgment in favor of defendants, Mobile County, a county sheriff, and other counties and sheriffs. Plaintiffs, by a declaratory action, alleged that 1973 Ala. Acts 1177, relating to compensation for sheriffs, was unconstitutional. The trial court severed two sentences from the Act and found the remaining portions constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that the Act was unconstitutional because it was a local bill that did not comply with the advertising requirements required by Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 106. Further, they alleged that the word &quot;compensation&quot; within the Act was vague. The trial court deleted provisions of the Act that made it a local law. Thus, the remaining provisions of the Act were constitutional and did not need to comply with &sect; 106. Because the Act was stripped of its local amendments, Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 111 did not apply because there was no reason to guard against any deception created by a local act. The plain language of the Act clearly indicated that the legislature intended the Act to be severable and that remaining valid provisions should survive. The trial court correctly construed &quot;compensation&quot; to mean the minimum basic salary, excluding overtime pay, benefits, and allowances. The purpose of the Act was to provide uniform minimum compensation of deputy sheriffs, and the inclusion of the additional variables would have defeated the uniformity. The remaining provisions established a reasonable population classification that bore a reasonable relationship to the minimum salary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
