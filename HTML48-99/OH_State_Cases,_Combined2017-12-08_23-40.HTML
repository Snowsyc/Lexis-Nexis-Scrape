</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action that involved appellee, the executor of the estate of a decedent, appellant, the guardian of the estate of the decedent's widow, sought review of a decision of the Knox County Probate Court (Ohio), which granted reconsideration of the election it made for the widow to take under the statute of descent and distribution, rather than in accordance with the decedent's will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died and was survived by the widow. A commissioner proposed that the probate court enter an election on the widow's behalf to take against the decedent's will. The probate court entered an election on the widow's behalf to take against the will of the decedent. The executor filed a motion for reconsideration, new trial, or relief from judgment as to the election. The widow died. The probate court vacated the election that had been made and elected on behalf of the widow to take under the will. In reversing and remanding the decision, the court found that the probate court erred in reconsidering its prior judgment. The remedy of reconsideration was no longer viable under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. The guardian was an improper party. There was no compliance with Ohio R. Civ. P. 25. However, the defect was waived for want of timely objection under Ohio R. Civ. P. 19(A). The probate court had considered the motion that sought reconsideration, a new trial, or relief from judgment on the wrong track. The guardian did not show that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.45 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the probate court and remanded the cause for further proceedings according to law and consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alleging that the councilman's public employment disqualified him from elective office pursuant to Maple City, Ohio, Charter art. III, &sect; 3, the residents sought a writ of mandamus compelling the vacation of the councilman's council seat; resident two sought a writ of quo warranto ordering his installation as councilman. The court granted the writs. The court found that the residents were entitled to the writ of mandamus, noting that they had the clear right to compel the council to comply with the charter and that no other remedy would have offered them adequate relief. The court rejected the councilman's contention that &sect; 3 violated his equal protection rights. Noting that neither the election restriction nor the councilman's employment status implicated an interest requiring a departure from traditional equal protection analysis, the court found that &sect; 3 was rationally related to the city's legitimate fiscal concerns. In light of its decision on the mandamus issue, the court found that resident one was entitled to the writ of quo warranto, noting that under Charter &sect; 2(b) an elected official was entitled to continue his term until a successor was legitimately elected.</SPAN></P>

Third-party defendant employer cross-appealed the trial court's denial of its motions to dismiss and for directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured when he was struck by a forklift after its brakes failed. The employee filed a complaint against the company. The company filed a third-party complaint against the employer alleging that if the company was negligent then the employer was negligent. The employee amended his complaint to allege that his injury was caused by the employer's negligent, wanton, wilful, and intentional misconduct. A jury rendered a verdict for the company and the employer was granted summary judgment. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that: (1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(D) did not abrogate jury trials on the issues of an employer's liability and damages for an intentional tort, and thus the trial court erred by not allowing the employee's intentional tort claim to go to the jury; (2) &sect; 4121.80(D) was ambiguous and thus the court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute and constitutional provisions were clearly incompatible; and (3) the employee's intentional tort claim against the employer was not time-barred because it related back to the claims against the company, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 15(C).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause as to the trial court's judgment against the employee and affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an involuntary committed patient, sought review of a judgment of the County of Summit Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which held that the patient was a mentally ill person subject to involuntary civil commitment under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.01(B)(4). The trial court ordered her to submit to case management services provided by a mental health center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after her ex-husband had filed an affidavit of mental illness. The referee found that the patient was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization for 60 days under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.01(B)(4). The patient argued on appeal that &sect; 5122.01(B)(4) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and failed to give adequate notice of the conduct upon which the proposed hospitalization was based. She also argued that the trial court erred in finding her to be a mentally ill person subject to court ordered civil commitment under &sect; 5122.01(B)(4). Because the challenge was based on vagueness, the court had to apply all reasonable presumptions, interpretations, and constructions that rendered the statute constitutionally definite. The court held that the constitutional standard, set forth in &sect; 5122.01(B)(4) defining &quot;mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order&quot; was not vague or overbroad because it set a particular standard, which a person of common intelligence could comprehend. The standard drew a line between those mentally ill persons who posed a danger to a public or to themselves and those who did not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants attempted to gain entry into the city's police department by taking the civil service examination. Following the test, both applicants were placed on the commission's eligibility list. However, after the applicants submitted to psychological tests, their names were removed from the eligibility list as a result of being found psychologically unacceptable. The applicants appealed to the commission to reinstate their names onto the eligibility list. The commission denied the request for reinstatement. The applicants then filed a declaratory judgment action, and the trial court reversed the commission's decision to remove the applicants names from the list. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the trial court did not have the authority to return the applicants names to the list because the list expired prior to the entry of the judgment. The subject matter of the trial court's order was moot, as no live controversy existed between the parties in regard to the reinstatement of the applicants' names onto the expired list.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas for Franklin County (Ohio) that upheld the decision of appellees, a school principal, superintendent, and school board, to impose a three-day suspension on the father's son for fighting with another student.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's son struck another student. The principal suspended the son for three days and the superintendent and school board affirmed that suspension. The trial court also affirmed. The father appealed. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court concluded that there was no violation of due process in the hearings conducted as part of the suspension process. Any error that did occur in the early steps of the process was of no consequence because there was an opportunity to cure it in a later hearing. The court noted, however, that the plain words of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.66(E) prevented the enforcement of a suspension in one school year for an incident that occurred in a prior school year. The court observed that the father's appeal to the trial court did not, in itself, prevent enforcement of the suspension and that the school voluntarily declined to enforce the suspension while the appeal was pending. Thus, and pursuant to &sect; 3313.66(E), the suspension could not now be enforced. Accordingly, the court found that, although the suspension could no longer be served, that fact did not negate the validity of the suspension itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee blood recipient filed a motion to compel appellant blood bank to provide the identification of an HIV infected blood donor whose blood was transfused into the blood recipient. The County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the order. The blood bank appealed, alleging that disclosure was barred by the constitutional right to privacy, statutory privilege, and Ohio's Privacy Act (Privacy Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1347.01 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order releasing the blood donor's identity was capable of review as a final appealable order because the donor's substantial rights of privacy and confidentiality were affected and subsequent review of the order provided an inadequate remedy. The court held that the physician-patient privilege in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.02 did not apply because (1) the blood was not drawn by a physician; (2) the donor's information was not a communication relating to his treatment; and (3) the donor was not a patient. Notwithstanding the restrictions placed on disclosure, the trial court abused its discretion in ordering disclosure of the donor's identity. In so holding, the court found that the harm resulting from the disclosure and the importance of protecting the donor's privacy interests, when balanced under Ohio R. Civ. P. 26(C), were paramount to the blood recipient's interest in pretrial discovery. Moreover, maintaining the blood supply was a vital public interest furthered by denying discovery of the donor's identity. The limitations imposed by the Privacy Act were inapplicable, as the information requested was made within the confines of the discovery process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's findings that the identity of the donor was not protected by the statutory physician-patient privilege and Ohio's Privacy Act. The court overruled the trial court's order compelling discovery of the blood donor's name and address.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed two acquaintances. He dismembered and disposed of their bodies, and the bodies were never found. The primary testimony against him came from a woman who was with him and helped hold one of the victims. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Because of the prosecutor's late disclosure of a police report, defendant claimed a due process violation. The court found defendant failed to demonstrate that a continuance would not have cured any prejudice caused by late disclosure of exculpatory evidence and his right to due process had not been violated. Defendant argued that the witness was an accomplice to the murders and her testimony had to be corroborated in order for it to be the basis of his conviction according to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(D). The court found that there was proper corroboration. The court rejected defendant's attempt to show that the witness was a co-defendant and to apply the rule of corpus delicti to co-defendants, finding that the witness was not a co-defendant because she was never charged with the crimes. The court rejected arguments claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, and the sentence was not excessive and was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for two counts of aggravated murder and overruled his 21 assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which found him guilty on multiple counts of aggravated murder with specifications. He was also convicted for kidnapping and felonious assault, each with firearm specifications. Defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unsuccessfully asserted the insanity defense at trial, and the trial court accepted the jury's recommendation of death based on the aggravating factors. On appeal, defendant argued that the State's interest could have been protected by a penalty less severe than death, such as life imprisonment. The court disagreed, holding that a death sentence was appropriate where the penalty was not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime. Similarly, the court rejected defendant's contention that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2929.03(C)(2) was overly weighted in favor of death because it failed to give the jury the option of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The court noted that the statute presented the jury with a range of options. Also, the court held that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2929.04 was not unconstitutional on the ground that the &quot;mental disease&quot; mitigating factor was unduly limited. The court determined that the listed factors gave defendant great latitude in presenting any relevant, favorable evidence. However, simply because he presented mitigating evidence did not guarantee that his evidence was given any weight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The bail pending appeal was terminated and the case was remanded for execution of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix filed suit by reason of decedent's death when he was suffocated by soy beans contained in a grain silo in which he was working. On appeal, the court held that the trial court committed error in each case in unconstitutionally retroactively applying the intentional tort definition included in the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 amendment which became effective while the actions were pending. However, as to the employee's action, there was no evidence that the employer acted to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task.

The salesman denied receiving such request from the realtor, but admitted that he had not paid his dues. The Commission cancelled the salesman's license and denied his request for reinstatement. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that (1) the salesman was not denied due process when his license was cancelled without a pretermination hearing because the salesman's license lapsed due to his own admitted negligence and inattention; (2) the salesman was not denied equal protection of the law because it was rational for the state to distinguish between salesmen and brokers regarding escrow of dues where a broker's license was a superior classification which had an independent status; and (3) it was not error to require the salesman to re-take his examination for reinstatement where the salesman was not licensed within the two-years proceeding the application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant customer challenged a summary judgment from the common pleas court (Ohio) in favor of appellee bank in an action to recover funds from a savings account the customer opened with a predecessor of the bank. The customer misplaced her passbook but did not inform the bank, which refused to pay on the account when the passbook was found. The trial court dismissed the customer's suits as time barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1101.08(F).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer opened a savings account with the bank, and allegedly misplaced her passbook approximately three years later. The customer maintained in her deposition that she did not receive notice of either of two bank acquisitions, and never reported her loss. She averred that she found the passbook some 13 years after its disappearance. When she presented it for payment the bank refused, contending that it had no record of her account. On appeal, the customer argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the actions as time-barred by &sect; 1101.08(F) because the case did not come within the ambit of &sect; 1101.08(F) and, as applied, &sect; 1101.08(F) deprived the customer of her right of action before it accrued. The court held that: (1) the passbook alone was insufficient to rebut the bank's evidence of the account status under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1107.06(F), which authorized banks to permit withdrawals without a passbook; (2) thus, only the internal records of the bank and not the passbook were determinative of the status of the bank account; and (3) since the customer did not raise the issue of the unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1101.08(F), the issue was waived on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court, and ordered that the bank recover of the customer the bank's costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendors filed an action seeking injunctive relief, and damages for alleged false arrest and conspiracy against trade. Their motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to confine arrests by off-duty police officers employed by the team to the team's property, was denied. Prior to any responsive pleadings, the vendors sought to file a second amended complaint to include a malicious prosecution claim. The trial court entered a judgment dismissing the claims in the amended complaint without ruling on the request to file the second amended complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the motion for a temporary restraining order was properly denied. However, the trial court abused its discretion by denying the vendor's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which had been timely filed in good faith. The court upheld the dismissal of the conspiracy against trade claim, but reversed the judgment of dismissal on the false-arrest claim, against the city, the police, and the team. The court also reversed the dismissal of the claims against the officer as he had not filed a responsive pleading or a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the denial of the motion for leave to amend, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Common Pleas Court, Summit County, Ohio, which convicted him of grand theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly refused to use its contempt power to compel the attendance of a defense witness. The court disagreed, holding that the trial court did not err because defendant had not complied with the procedural requirements of Ohio R. Crim. P. 17(D), which required that a return of service be filed with the clerk and that witness fees be tendered. Defendant next argued that his motion to dismiss should have been granted based on the two year delay between issuance of the arrest warrant and its execution. A police witness testified that there were several outstanding warrants for defendant from other jurisdictions. The warrant was executed when defendant was released from another jurisdiction. Defendant did not refute the testimony and the court held that the evidence showed reasonable diligence. In rejecting defendant's final arguments, the court held that prior convictions could be proven by evidence other than certified copies of the judgments. In this case, defendant had testified and had admitted to the prior convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Wayne County Municipal Court (Ohio) that denied defendant's motion to dismiss charges of gambling, a violation of Ohio Rev.

Following denial of her motion to dismiss defendant pled no contest and was convicted of gambling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged she was an employee of a fraternal organization that was exempt from prosecution for certain limited gambling activities. However, under Ohio Rev.

Defendant's fraternal organization did not have such a letter and the trial court therefore found that defendant was not entitled to an exemption. The court on appeal affirmed. Even if defendant's fraternal organization did qualify as an exempt charity defendant failed to show compliance with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02(D)(2)(c). The court also rejected an argument that unequal treatment of a fraternal organization as opposed to certain charities violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. There was a rational basis to treat religious, educational, and cultural groups that advanced legitimate state objectives differently than a fraternal organization that did not operate pro bono publico.</SPAN></P>

The amendment provided for an access through one of the lots of the plat into the new development. The fact that the partnership did not own the adjacent property at the time it filed the complaint did not necessarily deprive the partnership of standing, nor render the controversy merely academic. The court found that an actual controversy existed between the partnership and the lot owners as both sides were interested in how the land was to be used. While the effectiveness of the amendment was dependant upon governmental approval of the proposed development, this approval had nothing to do with whether the plat was validly amended. Thus, the amendment was not made invalid for want of governmental approval. The court could not say the trial court erred in finding the amendment valid even though not all lots were affected in the same manner. When construing the language pertaining to restrictions on the use of land, the language had to be construed so as to least restrict the free use of the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Less than two years after he suffered an injury at work, the employee instituted an intentional tort action against the employer. The employee claimed that his supervisor had ordered him to perform a hazardous operation that was substantially certain to cause the injury. The trial court sustained the employer's motion to dismiss on the basis that the employee's action was governed by and barred by the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80. The employee sought review of the trial court's decision, arguing that his claim was not subject to &sect; 4121.80 because his injury was not the result of a battery and that the retroactive application &sect; 4121.80 was otherwise unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the matter for further proceedings, holding that the employee's action was subject to the two-year limitations period found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10 because the employee had not alleged an over common law intent to cause injury but had made a claim that amounted to the employer's tolerance of an unsafe workplace. The court ruled that the employee's constitutional argument was moot.</SPAN></P>

On October 28, 1987, the Division of Reclamation moved to dismiss appellant's appeal for failure to prepay. On judicial appeal, the coal company claimed that the board erred in dismissing the coal company's appeal for failure to prepay the civil assessment penalties, alleging that Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the dismissal of the appeal, holding that the civil penalty assessments issued to the coal company were imposed due to present and continuing misconduct, and could not be declared a retroactive attempt to penalize the coal company.

In response, the city implemented an adjustment program to give its employees vacation pay leave adjustments retroactive to the date of that decision. The employees sought a declaration that the city's policy was in contravention of &sect; 9.44. The trial court certified the class, and determined that the six-year statute of limitations applied to bar the employees' claims in part. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the language of &sect; 9.44 was clear that the city was entitled to defer, but not to avoid, vacation credits earned from prior public employment. The employees were entitled to seek vacation benefits wrongly denied from the date of the filing of the complaint, back for a period of six years, and not beyond. They were entitled to retroactive application of &sect; 9.44, but the trial court did not err in finding the six-year statute of limitations applicable and the controlling date to be the date on which the complaint was first filed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Franklin Municipal Court of Warren County (Ohio), which convicted her for operating a nursing home without a state license based on her operation of four facilities where elderly persons resided and were provided with total care. Defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3721.01 et seq., regulating the licensing and operation of nursing homes, had unconstitutional impact on her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of her conviction for operating a nursing home without a license, as applied to the facilities she operated providing care for elderly residents. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's decision upon review of defendant's contentions. Defendant asserted that her residents could not afford to pay monthly fees sufficient to cover the costs of her compliance with state statutes and regulations. The court ruled that defendant's laudable interest in her residents' financial resources did not excuse her from complying with the regulations governing her type of business. In response to defendant's claim that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3721.01(A) was arbitrary and capricious because the state legislature's establishment of regulations was unreasonable in excluding relatives providing care for other relatives from the state licensing requirements, the court found that there were sufficient justifications based on the two types of situations to render the guidelines reasonable. The legislative authorization for an administrative agency to classify nursing homes under &sect; 3721.01 was not an unlawful delegation of authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a women's health center and two staff physicians, brought an action against defendants, named and unnamed individuals who allegedly engaged in tortious activities which interfered with the delivery of medical services at the center and with the physicians' private practices. The Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County (Ohio) permanently enjoined defendants as a class from conducting specified activities. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The health center provided reproductive health services for women, including abortions. The trial court's injunction contained, inter alia, a prohibition against defendants picketing in any form within the viewing distance of the health center at any location other than on a certain sidewalk. It further prohibited picketing within the viewing distance of the homes of patients, employees, and physicians of the center. The court found that defendants waived their opportunity to have the trial court's order certifying defendants as a class reviewed because no notice of appeal had been timely filed pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 4(A). Further, the court found that a provision of the injunction that effectively prohibited all speech on defendants' part, including public issue speech in any forum, constituted an impermissible prior restraint on speech. Additionally, the court determined that the portion of the trial court's order, which prohibited picketing, including the dissemination of literature and oral speech, within viewing distance of the center or plaintiffs' homes, was overly broad in that defendants had no way of determining where the homes were located.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the permanent injunction order be amended by changing a paragraph of the order which imposed volume restrictions that were overly broad and by deleting two paragraphs of the order, which banned verbal communications with center employees and banned picketing at the homes of patients and center staff and employees. As amended, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that had defendant been walking on foot instead of using an automobile for transportation, she would not have been charged with possession of criminal tools, i.e., her shoes, instead she would have been charged with the misdemeanor of solicitation. The court held that it was a violation of defendant's U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant's action seeking the removal of a prosecutor under Ohio Rev.

The trial court granted the county's motion to dismiss and the motion of the State and the Ohio Attorney General for summary judgment. The court affirmed. The court noted that an action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.03, for a declaration that a statute was unconstitutional, was available only if the statute affected the rights or status of the person seeking the declaration. Section 2721.03 did not authorize declaratory judgment actions that were in the nature of advisory opinions. The court concluded that, in order to maintain an action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 309.05, the complainant had to allege wanton and willful prosecutorial misconduct. The court found that the complainant failed to make this allegation. As a result, and because the allegations failed to state a claim for relief under &sect; 309.05, the complainant had no justiciable interest at stake, and the complainant's declaratory action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed accusing the chiropractor of professional misconduct.

The trial court affirmed the Board's order, and the chiropractor appealed. The court affirmed and held that the trial court's judgment was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The Board had proper jurisdiction over the proceedings, and its order was supported by the evidence. Because the Board had articulated its findings and reasoning, the court had no reason to reverse or remand on those grounds. The court found that the language of &sect; 4734-1-16(G) was specific enough to warn the chiropractic profession of conduct which was prohibited but broad enough to cover various situations. Thus, the provision was not unduly vague. Further, &sect; 4734-1-16(G) was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the initial appeal it was held that the issue of the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05 was not properly preserved. Thereafter, the grandparents filed a motion to hold the mother in contempt for failure to comply with the lower court's visitation order and to enforce that order. At the hearing on the motion, the mother again raised the issue of constitutionality. The lower court found that the statute was constitutional. The mother claimed that &sect; 3109.05(B) was unconstitutional because it created a suspect classification by allowing a court to grant visitation to &quot;others&quot; only against divorced persons and not married persons. Affirming, the court noted that the statute did make a distinction between divorced and non-divorced family situations but the classification was valid as it was based upon proper and justifiable distinctions that were reasonable and not purely arbitrary. The court noted that in the absence of a divorce, it was presumed that the rights of the parents and children were protected within the family unit. Upon divorce, however, the courts were called upon to intervene and to mediate because of the breakdown in relationships that had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants participated in an arranged drug purchase with an undercover officer and, after finding guns and cocaine, the officers arrested defendants and charged them with drug trafficking, among other things. Defendants appealed, contending in part that they should have received separate trials; that they were entrapped; that the trial court erred in making various evidentiary rulings; and that the weapons charges were improper. The court vacated the fine that had been assessed to defendant three because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(L) provided that no mandatory fine would be imposed upon a defendant who alleged prior to sentencing that he was indigent, which was the case here. However, the court otherwise affirmed the convictions. Defendants had failed to renew their motion for severance at the close of the State's case. They were not entrapped because the officers merely presented them with the opportunity to commit the offenses and defendants had the predisposition and criminal design to commit them. The court declined to disturb the jury's findings as to the weapons offenses and held that defendants two and three, as aiders and abettors, were properly convicted as principals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he pled guilty to one count of having a weapon while under a disability, defendant filed a pro se motion pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 5(A) that requested leave to file a delayed appeal of his conviction. The trial court granted the motion and appointed defense counsel. Defense counsel subsequently filed a motion for leave to withdraw as counsel for want of a meritorious, appealable issue. On review, the court found that defendant never filed a motion prior to sentencing to withdraw his guilty plea. Therefore the court held that defendant's conviction could have been set aside only to correct &quot;manifest injustice,&quot; as provided by Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.1. The court held that no specific facts existed in the record to indicate that defendant's plea was not entered intelligently or voluntarily. The court found no evidence of &quot;manifest injustice.&quot; The court held that defense counsel did not violate any essential duty to defendant by failing to discover the alleged &quot;unconstitutionality&quot; of Ohio Rev.

The jury found the employment was at will, and that the employee was discharged for cause, but without a hearing, on allegations of sexual harassment. The trial court granted the employer's motion for a verdict notwithstanding the verdict. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because any error in denial of a hearing was not substantial, as the jury found the employee was terminated for cause. Evidence of other instances of sexual harassment discovered after the termination was properly admitted to prove the employee's character pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 405(B) and pursuant to Ohio R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested while protesting outside an abortion clinic. The trial court convicted him under &sect; 2917.11(A)(5), which prohibited the commission of an act that served no lawful and reasonable purpose of the offender. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that defendant's intention was to demonstrate his opposition to abortion, and that in doing so he had abided by the law by limiting his demonstration to specifically designated areas. The court found that there was nothing about the characteristics of defendant's display itself that otherwise deprived it from serving defendant's reasonable and lawful purpose to engage in a peaceful protest. The court held that defendant's display was a form of symbolic expression that was not under the full definition of disorderly conduct contained in &sect; 2917.11(A)(5). Therefore, defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal under Ohio R. Crim. P. 29. The court did not address defendant's constitutional issues, noting that a court should not rule on constitutional claims that were not essential to the disposition of a particular controversy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment from the Perrysburg Municipal Court, Wood County (Ohio), which dismissed an action against defendant in which she was charged with bringing alcoholic beverages into a park or drinking alcoholic beverages in a park, a violation of Perrysburg, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 1090.06. The State claimed that the trial court improperly interpreted the ordinance and failed to make a finding after a plea of no contest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on charges of illegally bringing alcohol into a park or drinking alcoholic beverages in a park, a violation of &sect; 1090.06. Defendant entered a plea of no contest. The trial court ruled that the park was a state park and not a city park within the ambit of the involved ordinance. All offers of testimony by the State as to the nature of the park were denied. The trial court dismissed the case, and the State appealed. Upon review, the court reversed and held that the trial court's acceptance of defendant's plea of no contest was an abuse of discretion. A not guilty plea should have been entered by the trial court, and the case should have proceeded to trial. Next, the court held that the trial court erred in raising sua sponte the issue of the interpretation of the words &quot;park&quot; and &quot;use&quot; in the local ordinance. The trial court then erroneously failed to allow the State to litigate the questions raised by the trial court on the merits. The court noted that because the issue was not fully litigated in the trial court, it was not properly before the court on appeal. Thus, that assignment of error was not well taken, but the case was nonetheless reversed.</SPAN></P>

It was primarily engaged in hauling commodities in both interstate and intrastate commerce. It was regulated by both the PUCO and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The taxpayer utilized both company owned and broker vehicles for hauling bulk loads of chemicals, flour, sugar, slat, sand, slag, limestone, and other various products. In conjunction with hauling salt, the taxpayer also provided to the customer a salt piler to throw the salt into the customer's storage bins after the salt was delivered. The pilers were carried on pickup trucks. The taxpayer had a vehicle to assist state and municipal agencies in the event of the spill of an environmentally hazardous material carried by the taxpayer's trucks and a vehicle it used in accident investigations and spill containment. The court affirmed the Board's decision. The court determined that the taxpayer rendered a public service and could be considered a public utility. However, the taxpayer's property had to be used exclusively for public service to be exempt from taxes.

He found that she was in too much pain and sent her to defendant dentist. He gave her a shot in her left arm and told her to return. The dentist and another defendant dentist had difficulty giving the patient shots the next day. After the dental procedure, the patient complained of pain in her left arm. The patient then saw three doctors including defendant doctor and was diagnosed with phlebitis and thoracic outlet syndrome. On appeal, the court found no errors. Under the new Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A), a written notice of a claim extended the time for filing suit by 180 days. While the patient filed a written notice, under the older version of the statute, there was a difference between medical claims and dental claims. The court reasoned that the procedure was dental in nature and that the patient could not invoke the notice. The enforcement of the written notice rule was not a denial of equal protection. When the patent went to the dental office two days after the procedure complaining of extreme pain and complications, the time period was triggered.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.90, now known as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3303.21, gave immunity because there was no evidence of willful or wanton misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's medical expert pointed to some acts and omissions by the emergency squad members as they transported a child to the hospital where she subsequently died, but never opined that there was willful or wanton misconduct. On appeal, the court found that the immunity statute was enacted with a rational basis related to protecting a legitimate state interest, the safety and welfare of citizens. The court held that the statute not only was constitutional but also was inherently necessary for the protection of the public in life-threatening situations. The court pointed out that without immunity, no emergency squad member in his right mind would embark on an emergency call if there was a chance of death or a worsening of condition. The court further held that less than perfect omissions of the members spoke to the issue of negligence, not to wilful or wanton misconduct. The court equated actual malice with &quot;willful and wanton&quot; and defined the later term as a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others that had a great probability of causing substantial harm. The court found that there was no evidence that created a genuine issue of material fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced. Custody of the parties' three minor children was originally vested in the mother, and the father was ordered to pay child support.

The next year, the mother filed a motion for change of custody and for an increase in the amount of the child support obligation. The court found that the father was not accorded the procedural due process mandated by Ohio Rev.

In addition, the record contained no evidence of an investigation or of findings filed by the county bureau of support.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Mount Vernon Municipal Court (Ohio), which found him guilty of violating Mount Vernon, Ohio, City Ordinance &sect; 335.07, driving under suspension or revocation. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in its denial of his motion for dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel had filed a motion to dismiss the charge claiming that &sect; 335.07 was invalid. Defendant argued that because the language of &sect; 335.07 substantially tracked the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4507.38, 4507.39, and because &sect;&sect; 4507.38, 4507.39 were subsequently repealed; Mount Vernon, Ohio, City Ordinance &sect; 335.07 should have been considered void and invalid. The court, on appeal, rejected that proposition as an incorrect statement of the law. Defendant's argument neglected to examine the reasons why Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4507.38, 4507.39 were repealed. That was a crucial consideration when weighing the effect on a parallel municipal ordinance. In a case where a state statute if found to be unconstitutional because of faulty language, it was true that the validity of a municipal ordinance based upon that statute must have been re-evaluated. However, where a state statute was simply reworded and renumbered to appear in a different part of the code, the meaning and validity of the ordinance was in no way compromised. The court found that Mount Vernon, Ohio, City Ordinance &sect; 335.07 was adequate to provide defendant with notice of the offense with which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

The doctor cross appealed on grounds that the nunc pro tunc order that effectively extended the patient's time to appeal the judgment was erroneously entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gist of the patient's action was that the doctor was negligent in administering a certain drug by not measuring the amount of the drug in his blood at its &quot;peak&quot; and &quot;trough&quot; periods, and by not informing him of the risks involved. On appeal, the patient contended inter alia that the lower court erred in not charging the jury on res ipsa loquitur and in not permitting him to testify that he would not have consented had he been aware of the risks. The court ruled that the lower court did not err. The court held that: (1) because the patient's claim was not based on circumstantial evidence, the lower court was not required to give an instruction on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur; (2) the lower court did not err in limiting the finding of negligence to the &quot;peak and trough&quot; levels because that was the issue raised by the patient's pleadings; (3) the patient's hypothetical testimony as to whether he would have subjectively consented to taking the drug was irrelevant because a lack of informed consent was established by an objective standard; and (4) medical books and treatises were not admissible into evidence to prove the truth of the statements contained within.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged the decision of the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B) to be constitutional and entered judgment for appellee city transit authority on the insurer's subrogated claim. The insurer had challenged the constitutionality of the provision in &sect; 2744.05(B) that barred insurers' claims against political subdivisions under subrogation clauses of insurance contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff insured for the $ 250 paid by him. The trial court also found that the insurer, as a subrogated claimant, was not entitled to recover the $ 592.76 balance of the damages under &sect; 2744.05(B). The insurer argued that the provision barring insurers' subrogation rights violated the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court reversed and remanded, finding that &sect; 2744.05(B) amounted to an unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the law. The court questioned that if the general assembly permitted recovery from a political subdivision by the injured person, why could the injured party not accept payment from his own insurance company, and thereupon assign his claim to the insurance company who in turn would step into the shoes of the injured party and file suit, as a plaintiff, against the political subdivision? The court found that to deny the insurer that right was to deny it the equal protection of the laws. Therefore, the court concluded that the provision of &sect; 2744.05(B) that purported to bar subrogated claims against political subdivisions was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case to that court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the insurer in the stipulated amount of $ 592.76.</SPAN></P>

Based on res judicata, the County of Summit Common Pleas Court (Ohio) again granted summary judgment to the physician. The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December 1985, the minor claimed that the physician committed medical malpractice in a surgery that took place in May 1981. Based on the applicable four-year statute of limitations, the physician was granted summary judgment in April 1986. The summary judgment was affirmed in October 1986. In December 1986, however, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the limitations bar was unconstitutional as applied to minors. Thus, in April 1987, the minor brought an identical malpractice suit against the same physician. Finding that res judicata barred the minor's second suit, the trial court granted the physician's motion for summary judgment. The minor sought review. The court affirmed because, where a valid and existing final judgment was rendered for the physician on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired prior to the commencement of the case, such judgment was one on the merits, barring recommencement of the same suit, by virtue of the doctrine of res judicata. The fact that the original judgment may have been erroneous was of no significance. Moreover, the saving clause in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.19 did not constitute an exception to the doctrine of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

The complaint was dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that even assuming negligence existed, that the city was immune from liability under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02. The court held that &sect; 2744.02 did not lack specificity because it was a total exemption and freedom from liability regardless of any negligence laws. The court further held that sovereign immunity was not abolished as it applied to detention facilities and that the place of the inmate's incarceration qualified as a detention facility. The determined that the application of sovereign immunity did not deny the inmate equal protection because the difference in classification between inmates and other persons was reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township's board of trustees filed an application for a restraining order to prevent the businessman from adding to and maintaining a junkyard in violation of the township's zoning ordinance. The township alleged that the junkyard posed a threat of immediate and irreparable injury to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens. The township also sought a temporary injunction ordering the businessman to clean up the property. The trial court granted a permanent injunction, which incorporated an agreement reached by the parties. The businessman was ordered to clean up the property and was permanently enjoined from violating the zoning regulation. The businessman appealed the injunction. The court found that the trial court's order regarding the injunction incorporated the parties' agreement on the matter. Thus it was not technically a judicial determination of the parties' rights but was a consent decree. The businessman did not raise the defense of fraud, incapacity, or lack of valid consent; thus the court affirmed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges signed an amendment to the court rules that provided that the weekly legal newspaper was authorized to publish all legal notices or advertisements that were required by law to be published in a newspaper or newspaper of general circulation as set forth in Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2701.09 as a daily law journal and designated it as the daily law journal to publish all calendars of the courts. The trial court found the order lawful. On appeal, the daily newspaper argued that court calendars could only be published in daily law journals, which the weekly legal newspaper was not. The court interpreted &sect; 2701.09 as requiring the judges of a county to designate a daily law journal as the journal in which court calendars must be published only in those counties in which a daily law journal was printed. However, the court found that the judges could not incorporate the type of &quot;funneled, restrictive provision&quot; that they had into their order, and found such order to be an invalid restriction on the selection of a newspaper of general circulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The manner in which one of the 100 questions on the exam was graded was changed pursuant to a decision of the civil service commission after the original results had been certified to the appointing authority. Before the change, the employee had placed second on the list, but he slipped to the third position subsequent to recomputation. The trial court applied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04 and held that the commission's decision was in accordance with the law. Affirming, the court rejected the employee's contention that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.45 required the commission to post the answer key for five days before giving out the test results and that its failure to do so resulted in the denial of his right to contest the answers. The court found the employee failed to inquire about the answers and did not demonstrate that the ranking of the final scores would have changed had his answers been credited. It was not unreasonable to give one-half credit for an answer, and the employee failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

The board denied the variance. The property owner contended that the trial court erred in failing to rule for the property owner and that the finding of the board was void for failure to advertise the public hearing for a variance. The property owner also asserted that the trial court erred in finding that the property owner did not exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to bring the action under Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed, holding that, because the property owner was attacking the constitutionality of the finding of the board rather than the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance itself, the property owner should have brought a ch. 2506 action and, as a result, the property owner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to bringing the declaratory judgment action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A ward was placed in a nursing home after a heart attack left her partly paralyzed. Prior to the attack, appellant lived with the ward and alleged that the couple had planned to get married. The ward was adjudged incompetent. Both appellant and the ward's niece filed applications to be appointed a guardian for the ward. The niece was appointed as guardian. Subsequently, appellant was barred from visiting the ward in the nursing home because he allegedly interfered with the ward's care. The probate court denied appellant's motion to permit visitation finding that it was not in the ward's best interest. The probate court also denied appellant's motion to remove the niece as guardian and to appoint himself. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that there was evidence that the ward did not want to see appellant. Thus, appellant was denied his constitutional right to freedom of association and his rights under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3721.13(A)(20) were not violated. Moreover, appellant did not have standing to assert a constitutional claim on the ward's behalf. Appellant waived his right to appeal his constitutional claims because he failed to raise them in the probate court.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court overruled the objections, finding the ward to be incompetent by reason of mental disability and advanced age and finding the appointed guardian suitable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward was admitted to the hospital for treatment of a heart attack and stroke. The niece filed an application to be appointed the ward's guardian and was represented by her husband, an attorney. A doctor, represented by a second attorney, also filed an application for guardianship. Prior to a hearing the doctor's application was withdrawn. Both attorneys claimed to represent the ward. On appeal, the court held that court of common pleas acted within its jurisdiction when it considered all of the evidence before it and made a finding based upon that evidence that the ward was an incompetent person by reason of mental disability. The court held that the attorneys' challenges to the constitutionality of both the guardianship proceedings and the guardianship statute were not presented, considered, or decided at the trial court level and it would not consider them on appeal. The court found that the attorney failed to specify in his brief any reasons for the unsuitability of the court of common pleas appointed guardian, nor did it find any evidence in the record to demonstrate that the court of common pleas abused its discretion in the appointment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged the affirmation by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) of the decision of the Franklin County Board of Commissioners to allow appellee City of Westerville to annex approximately 162.631 acres of land in Blendon Township and the denial of the owners' petition for an injunction against the annexation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court affirmation of the Board's decision to allow the City to annex property, the owners' appealed. The owners argued that the trial court erred in finding that the proposed annexation was lawfully brought under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 709.02-.11, by petition of the owners, because of the City's involvement in the annexation. Affirming the trial court's decision the court held that &sect; 709.02-.11 did not provide that only landowners could have been involved in the annexation of property. Since a municipality was allowed to own public utilities outside its territories, the court concluded that a municipality within its discretion may involve itself in extraterritorial activities such as an owners' annexation petition in order to ensure that the City could continue growing. The owners also contended that the Board's order was invalid because it resulted from private deliberations in violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect;121.22, the Sunshine Law. The court noted that the annexation proceeding was a quasi-judicial hearing, which was not considered a meeting and, hence, did not fall within the Sunshine Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner purchased certain land, with the intent of conducting her court reporting business. Prior to any actual use of the property, the village served the property owner with notice that she was in violation of the village's zoning ordinances. The village filed a declaratory judgment action seeking construction of Batavia Codified Ordinances &sect; 1135.01. The trial court found that the general term &quot;service type use&quot; must yield to the more specific term of performing a service for profit as a business. The property owner appealed. The court held that the trial court's statutory construction was tantamount to an impermissible extension in violation of the requirement that a permitted use be liberally construed in favor of permitting the proposed use. The court held that the provision of court reporting services, albeit for a profit, constituted a service-type use and fell within the scope of &sect; 1135.01(a)(4). The court found that the trial court erroneously interpreted the language in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the landowner filed his appeal from the city council's denial of his application for a zoning change, he also filed a motion for permission to introduce additional testimony pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506. The trial court denied permission because the landowner had made no demand at the city council hearing to administer an oath to the witnesses and dismissed the appeal. On further review, the court ruled that the landowner's failure to object to the city council's taking of unsworn testimony constituted a waiver of the necessity for an oath at the hearing, but that the waiver applying to unsworn statements at the administrative level did not extend further to waive the landowner's statutory right under &sect; 2506.03 to introduce additional testimony at the appellate level. Noting that the landowner filed no affidavit of deficiency in the trial court and no deficiency appeared on the face of the transcript, the court further ruled that the landowner adequately brought the deficiencies in the hearing before the city council to the attention of the trial court under &sect; 2506.03 through unsworn affidavits.</SPAN></P>

Defendant replaced a hot water heater for a customer by connecting the appliance to the existing plumbing system of the home. The court held that Canton, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1315.01(a) was not vague because it expressly defined plumbing and expressly named hot water heaters. This language, in addition to the fact that Canton, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1315.08(c)(1) specifically required that a permit be obtained for the installation, repair, and replacement of water heaters, precluded any claim that the ordinance was grammatically vague as well as any argument that the ordinance was vague in the constitutional sense.The ordinance was not impermissibly arbitrary, even though it exempted water softeners, because that was a political question properly left to the legislative branch of government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department revoked the owner's licenses to operate residential care facilities for mentally retarded adults on the grounds that the facilities were dirty and in poor condition and that the hygiene of the residents was very poor and obviously unsupervised. The trial court affirmed the department's orders. The court affirmed, determining that the owner was not entitled to a hearing before all the residents were removed. Although the department failed to send a warning letter under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5123:2-3-07(O), Appendix E, 3.2.1 with regard to the problems at one of the facilities, such a letter was not necessary where the license revocation was predicated upon an overall mismanagement as evidenced by a continual failure of the operator to meet the minimal standards set by the licensure rules. Because no correction of the situation by the owner was possible, a warning letter was not necessary. There was substantial and reliable evidence to prove a majority of the more serious violations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding before a three judge panel in a trial court (Ohio) defendant was found guilty of five counts of aggravated murder, three counts of attempted aggravated murder, and guilty of a firearm specification on each of the eight counts. Defendant appealed from the termination entry sentencing him to death on each of the five murder counts and to three consecutive terms of seven to 25 years on the attempted murder counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it inadequately examined a child witness to determine his competency to testify and refused to allow expert evaluation and examination on his competency. The court disagreed. Defendant had been accused of killing several people. The child witness was the only eyewitness to testify to the criminal activity. The court held that a trial court had broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence. The court found neither prejudicial nor an implication that the panel's attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable in its ruling. Defendant also argued that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting photographs that were repetitive and cumulative in nature and that the probative value did not outweigh the prejudice to defendant. Relevant photographs were generally admissible if their probative value outweighed their potential prejudicial impact. Properly authenticated photographs, even if gruesome, were admissible in a capital prosecution if relevant and of probative value in assisting the trier of fact. In the view of the court, the photographs met the tests for admissibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant vehicle owner sought review of a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, Lorain County, (Ohio) that granted plaintiff city's application to dispose of property held in custody of a law enforcement agency and ordered the forfeiture of the owner's vehicle, which had been impounded subsequent to his son's arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's vehicle was impounded after his son was arrested and it was discovered that the vehicle identification number (VIN) was improperly attached. The owner transferred title to his son's wife. The son and his wife filed a replevin action. A municipal court's dismissal of that action was reversed. On remand, the vehicle was released pending trial. Thereafter, the city filed an application to dispose of the property pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.41. The trial court ordered the vehicle forfeited upon finding that its original identity was incapable of being established in a manner that excluded any reasonable probability that it was stolen. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.62 relating to the burden of proof required by the owner was not greater than before the passage of &sect; 4549.62. The court also held that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2933.41, as amended, a criminal offense was not a predicate to forfeiture, that the existence of the replevin action did not constitute a defense in abatement to the city's action, and that the finding that the dashboard VIN had been removed was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) sought review of a decision of the Common Pleas Court, County of Medina (Ohio), which, on appeal from an administrative ruling, found Ohio Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon notification of his third conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, the BMV advised the driver that his driving privileges had been indefinitely suspended pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.08 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16. The BMV notified the driver that he had a right to an administrative hearing, but the driver chose to appeal to the trial court, challenging the legality of the suspension on the ground that &sect; 4501:1-1-16 was unconstitutional in that it created a conclusive presumption that denied him due process of law. The BMV asserted that the appeal should have been dismissed because the driver did not exhaust his administrative remedies as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.06. The trial court declared Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16&nbsp;unconstitutional because the definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot; was a conclusive presumption that denied the driver due process of law, and the trial court vacated the suspension. On the BMV's appeal, the court reversed, holding that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12, the driver had to exhaust all of his administrative remedies before he could perfect an appeal to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local-option election was conducted in the supermarket's precinct, the result of which was that the sale of alcoholic beverages was prohibited. The supermarket did not receive notice of the election. At the time of the election, the supermarket was a holder of a liquor permit. The department notified the supermarket that it could no longer sell beer, wine, or mixed beverages at its present location, but could keep the permit for possible transfer to another location. The supermarket filed an action and the court found in favor of the department. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the Supreme Court of Ohio had twice held that liquor permits were neither contracts nor property. The court found that the statutory provisions pertaining to local-option elections violated neither the federal Due Process nor the Equal Protection Clause. The court determined that the supermarket was not entitled to specific notice of the impending local-option election. The court concluded that to the extent that the supermarket had a property right in the liquor permits themselves, the rights were preserved and had not been taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer was a smelting and processing company. While the employee was at work, his supervisor ordered him to place aluminum smelting material in a furnace. The employee placed the materials in the furnace with the aid of a loading machine. Because the materials were damp, an explosion occurred which caused the employee to be thrown from the loading machine and injured. After he filed his lawsuit, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 was enacted, making modifications to the common law that restricted a worker's ability to bring suit against his employer for intentionally tortious conduct. Upon the employee's motion, the trial court declared &sect; 4121.80&nbsp;unconstitutional because it retroactively effected substantial rights of the employee. The court affirmed, agreeing that it would be unconstitutional to apply &sect; 4121.80 to the employee retroactively. First, &sect; 4121.80(D) affected a substantive right because it limited the employee's common law right and created another type of right in lieu thereof. Second, &sect; 4121.80(G)(1) affected a substantive right by making the employee's burden of proof more stringent. Third, &sect; 4121.80(A) served to retroactively limit the employee's possible recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city filed an action against appellees, a cinema company and others, to collect unpaid taxes after the enactment of an admission tax ordinance. Appellees raised a counter-claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The city challenged a decision of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied its motion for summary judgment and which held that the ordinance was unconstitutional and awarded judgment to appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the admission tax ordinance violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Under the admission tax ordinance, other than appellees, there were only a limited number of places upon which the admission tax was imposed. Exempt under the admission tax ordinance were recreational facilities where a membership fee was required. The court reversed and held that legislative enactments enjoyed a strong presumption of constitutionality. On review of legislative acts, the court was bound to give a constitutional rather than an unconstitutional construction, if one was reasonably available. A taxing authority could discriminate between trades and activities and was not required to follow any predetermined method of classifying those that it selected for taxation, provided that the classification rested upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relationship to the taxation. Here, under a rational basis test, there was a perceptible difference between charging an admission and charging a membership fee, which thereby constituted a valid legislative distinction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the ordinance in question was constitutional. The case was remanded to the trial court, however, for further proceedings to determine whether the city violated the money transfer statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a trial court (Ohio). Defendant was convicted of criminal child enticement, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.05, and public indecency, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.09. He was sentenced to 180 days' imprisonment and fined on the child enticement charge and was sentenced to 30 days and a fine on the public indecency charge. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of exposing himself to a child and asking her if she wanted a ride in his car. The court rejected defendant's argument that the child enticement statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.05, was facially vague or overbroad. The court held that the statute provided reasonable notice of the conduct it prohibited. The court noted that the police could ascertain the type of conduct covered by the statute with sufficient ease to avoid discriminatory enforcement. Accordingly, the court found that the statute was not vague or overbroad either facially or as applied to defendant. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him to the maximum possible terms of confinement and in fining him the maximum amounts allowed by law. The court held that the trial court's statement to the effect that it was of the opinion that the statutory penalties provided by the legislature were insufficient for these particular crimes did not show a disregard for the factors enumerated in the sentencing statute. The court indulged in the presumption that absent a contrary showing, a judge was presumed to have followed the applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged an order of the Highland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to appellee subrogee on the insurer's untimely construction defect action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subrogee resold a house that he built. The purchasers submitted a claim to the insurer for losses allegedly caused by a defect in the fireplace, which resulted in a fire that caused significant property damages. The insurer sought recovery from the subrogee. The lower court grated summary judgment to the subrogee, holding that the 10-year limitation period of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.31 had expired. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the injury complained of occurred more than 10 years after completion of construction. As such, it was time-barred under the clear and unambiguous language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131. That was so despite the fact that the property was sold by the builder to a third party less than 10 years prior to the fire. The limitation period ran from the time the improvement to real property took place. That rule did not result in a violation of equal protection or the open court provision of the Ohio Constitution. Section &sect; 2305.31 was designed to protect architects and engineers from extensive liability, which was a rational objective.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in entering a judgment of conviction against defendant for two counts of aggravated murder when only one victim's death was at issue. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as it pertained to defendant's conviction for murder with prior calculation and design and as it pertained to the death sentence. The court found no error in the trial court's admission of photographs of the victim's body, finding that the photographs illustrated witnesses' testimony as to the murder site, the victim's cause of death, and defendant's liability therefore. Furthermore, the court rejected defendant's claim that his confession was involuntary and, thus, inadmissible. Lastly, the court found that the sentence of death was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee adjacent lot owner filed an action seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting appellant lot owner from moving a single family house onto her lot. The Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted relief enjoining the lot owner from constructing or placing a single family dwelling on the lot and enjoining the zoning inspector from issuing a building permit. The lot owner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owner also owned a lot across the alley from the lot she intended to place a dwelling on. The zoning inspector combined the two lots, even though it had never been done before, in order to meet the minimum square footage requirement necessary to erect a dwelling on under Chillicothe, Ohio, Cod. Ordinances &sect; 1162.03(a). The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.42 used the word &quot;adjoining&quot; to mean &quot;touching or contiguous&quot; and to be in contact with, and that Chillicothe, Ohio, Cod. Ordinances &sect; 1123.25 defined &quot;lot area&quot; as an area not including any area in a &quot;street or alley.&quot; The court thus determined that the lot owner could not combine the two lots and could not place a house on the single lot. The court then concluded that the adjacent lot owner did not have to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he would suffer irreparable harm as a result of appellant's proposed relocation of the structure to her property because the action was brought under Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 713.13, which provided the much lower standard of &quot;special damage.&quot; Ohio recognized that an owner of real property was competent to testify as to the market value of the property.</SPAN></P>

The passengers contended that trial court erred when it did not apply Ohio substantive law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a car trip that began and ended in Ohio, while in Indiana, the passengers were injured in a crash that resulted from the driver's negligence. All parties involved were Ohio residents. The trial court dismissed the action, citing Indiana's guest statute. That statute was substantially the same as Ohio's guest statute, which had been held unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed because the rule of lex loci deliciti no longer determined which body of substantive law applied to the recovery of damages in Ohio resulting from vehicular accidents in another state that exclusively involved residents of Ohio. Therefore, Ohio law governed the passenger's action. The court rejected the driver's contention that the exception to lex loci delicti created chaos on the highway because the recovery of damages was separable from and had nothing to do with the enforcement of traffic regulations, which were governed by local law. Because the relationship between driver and passengers was created in Ohio where they began and ended their trip, driving across a state line did not affect Ohio's compelling interest in the litigation of damage that arose from that relationship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four counts of gross sexual imposition. The record showed that defendant made sexual contact with his 12 year-old daughter who testified that defendant came into her bedroom, got on top of her, placed his penis between her legs and ejaculated on her. The second victim, a 12 year-old neighbor, testified that defendant grabbed her breast. The third victim, defendant's 14 year-old step-daughter, testified that defendant threw her on the floor and attempted to undress her and grabbed her on her breast and her genital area, and testified that on a different occasion, defendant came into her bedroom, got on top of her, and put his penis between her legs. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error by permitting all of the State's witnesses to testify as to previous or subsequent criminal acts wholly independent of the criminal offense for which defendant was on trial.

Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant evidence. Pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 404(B) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59, evidence of other crimes and acts were not admissible to prove character but were admissible to show motive, opportunity, intent, or plan. Although such evidence was to be strictly construed against the State and to be conservatively applied by the trial court, the court found that, because the evidence proved defendant's motive, it was admissible. The court further determined that the prosecutor's comments were not so prejudicial against defendant as to require reversal because they had not deprived defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial. The court lastly found that circumstantial evidence was sufficient to prove the elements of a crime because reasonable minds would have agreed that such evidence was consistent with defendant's guilt. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51(A) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.62(D)(1). Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress. The court held that the trial court had not erred in failing to grant the motion to suppress because the police were permitted to seize items that were in their plain view without a warrant. Section 4549.62 made it illegal to buy, sell, or offer to buy or sell any vehicle with knowledge that the VIN had been removed. However, the court determined that it was not unlawful under the statute to replace parts of a vehicle even when such caused the vehicle to appear totally different from the manufacturer's description. Additionally, the statute required knowledge of the alteration of the VIN, which the State failed to establish that defendant had. The court found that the State failed to prove that defendant had violated the statute and reversed that conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to the police station to complaint about an incident. She was arrested and jailed pursuant to a bench warrant that was allegedly issued for her failure to appear in response to a summons to answer to a minor misdemeanor. During the booking procedure, an officer asked defendant to remove all of her personal property. Defendant did not want to give up her wedding rings. They were forcibly removed, and defendant was charged with disorderly conduct. The court held that there was no proof of the truth of the allegation that defendant failed to respond to a summons. Because the underlying offense in the summons was a minor misdemeanor defendant was entitled to be released upon her own unsecured recognizance pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 46(D). The court found that defendant did not resist arrest. No factual basis was established for a reasonable expectation that other prisoners would steal her rings. Defendant's reaction did not rise to the level of disorderly conduct as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(1).

The trial court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment on the basis that appellants did not timely file their claim within a year after discovery of the physical injury caused by appellees. The court found that the patient knew not only of prior facts putting him on inquiry, but an opinion and legal theory indicating malpractice and requiring prompt attention. The court held that the patient had an obligation to get a second opinion and should have been aware of a need for further inquiry because his pain increased after earlier procedures.

Second, the court independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against mitigating factors. Finally, the court independently considered whether defendant's sentence was disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to warrant defendant's conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further held that in weighing the mitigating factor of defendant's age against the heinous and wanton nature of the aggravating circumstances of this case, the aggravating circumstances clearly outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the court held that the evidence presented sustained the finding of aggravating circumstances in this case, the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, and that the sentence of death imposed upon defendant was appropriate in this case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order from the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss three complaints against him for child enticement under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.05 and declared &sect; 2905.05&nbsp;unconstitutional because it was vague, indefinite, and overbroad on its face.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the trial court erred in holding &sect; 2905.05&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case. The court found that the trial court determined that overbreadth was one flaw of &sect; 2905.05. However, the overbreadth doctrine was confined to First Amendment cases and did not apply to the present case. The court ruled that vagueness had to be judged by the standard of whether &sect; 2905.05 reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct and whether it failed to give fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his contemplated conduct was prohibited. The court found that certain words in &sect; 2905.05 were defined in other statutes while other words were to have been read in context and accorded their ordinary meanings pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.42. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.05 provided fair notice of that conduct which it prohibited. Also, &sect; 2905.05 followed the formula for defining a crime as prescribed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.21(A) because child enticement required an act with an accompanying culpable mental state. Section 2905.05 was not facially vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the insurer claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B) retroactively destroyed a subrogation claim that existed before the effective date of the statute.

Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B) as applied to insurer-subrogees was a substantive law. Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds were involved in an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist. The case was sent to binding arbitration pursuant to the insurance contract. The arbitrator awarded the insureds punitive damages. The trial court vacated the arbitrator's punitive damage award because the arbitrator did not have the authority to award punitive damages. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the 1986 amendment to the uninsured motorist statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(1), which provided that coverage under the uninsured motorist statute did not include the payment of punitive damages, was not a unconstitutionally retroactive law in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The insureds did not accrue a substantive right to receive punitive damages before the amendment became effective. When the insureds had no right to recover punitive damages until a written decision of the arbitrators bound the insureds and the insurer, they had not accrued a right to punitive damages when the amendment became effective. The insureds right to contract pursuant to &sect; 28 was not impaired because there was no mention of punitive damages in the insurance contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee and a co-employee got into a fight which resulted in their discharge.

The trial court entered judgment against the employee on his claims against the employer and the co-employee for assault, for ratifying the assault, for wrongful discharge, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The employee appealed, contending that the trial court erred in finding that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4121.80 applied to deny the employee a jury trial on his assault claim, and in not finding &sect; 4121.80&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court found that allegation of error well-taken and reversed, holding that &sect; 4121.80 had been found unconstitutional because it eliminated the right to a jury trial. Moreover, because the question of the employer's ratification of the assault would have been a jury question, the error was not harmless because a jury might have awarded the employee punitive damages. However, the court concluded that the trial court properly directed a verdict for the employer on the wrongful discharge claim. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his probation was revoked solely because of his chronic alcoholism. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that although counsel for defendant had adequately argued the proposition that a person could not have been punished because of his status as an alcoholic, it was well-established that addiction was a disease and not punishable as such. The court concluded that defendant's probation was not revoked because he was an alcoholic, despite that the convictions arose, no doubt, out of the alcoholism, but that they were the result of his conduct, not his status as an alcoholic. The court ruled that every person, regardless of his status, was responsible for his conduct. The court found that the trial court revoked defendant's probation on his performance and his stipulated criminal acts, not because of his status or disease. The court determined that it was clear from the record that the revocation rested entirely on the conviction as a violation of probation and not on defendant's problems with alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a court of common pleas (Ohio) that, upon a jury verdict, convicted him of felonious assault, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11 with a firearm specification, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2941.141, 2920.71. The trial court had denied defendant's motion for acquittal. Defendant was sentenced to 3 years' actual incarceration on the gun specification and 4 to 15 years' imprisonment for felonious assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and a witness testified that co-defendant struck the victim in the face and that defendant brandished a gun and fired a shot at the victim as he fled from defendant and co-defendant. On appeal, the court ruled that because defendant did not file written requests, the trial court did not err by not instructing the jury on &quot;assault&quot; and &quot;negligent assault&quot; as lesser-included offenses. Even if defendant's oral requests were deemed sufficient, the trial court did not err because the evidence was insufficient to support the instructions. There was no plain error in the trial court's instructions on &quot;knowingly&quot; and &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; or in the omission of an instruction on &quot;causation.&quot; The court rejected defendant's claim that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11(A)(2), the felonious assault statute, denied equal protection because it provided a greater penalty for an attempt offense than a conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.02, the attempt statute. It was entirely rational and within the realm of the legislature to include an attempt to cause physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon within the felonious assault statute and therefore to be punished differently.</SPAN></P>

The employer filed a similar cross-claim against the insurer.

The insurer filed a motion requesting the trial court to transfer the damage aspect of the action to the Ohio Industrial Commission under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(D).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners had a parcel of land that was zoned as a PUD for the purpose of building multi-family dwellings designated as &quot;senior citizen housing.&quot; The association filed a declaratory judgment challenging the owners' construction of the dwellings within 200 feet of an R-1 Zoning District, which was the zoning restriction for the residents of the association. The association also alleged that the adoption and implementation of the zoning ordinance represented an arbitrary and unconstitutional exercise of the zoning power. The trial court entered judgment for defendants and the court affirmed. The court found that the PUD was properly classified as a PUD-R, and not a PUD-R/B, and thus the 50 foot set-back distance applied. The court found that although Beavercreek, Ohio., Code &sect; 17.06.1 did not provide for the use of nursing homes in a PUD-R zone, such uses were possible as a conditional use, and thus the use of the PUD to build a nursing home did not preclude the area from being designated as a PUD-R.

The court determined that a zoning resolution was not unconstitutional unless it was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. The landowner had the burden to overcome the presumption of validity that all zoning resolutions possessed. Based on the operation of a pit with the noise, dust, traffic, and other considerations, the landowner had not met his burden. The statute regulating surface mining, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Ch. 1514, did not preempt the Board from promulgating zoning regulations of surface mining in the district.</SPAN></P>

The victim and defendant had been friends for an extensive period of time, but defendant was upset that the victim had recently begun dating defendant's ex-girlfriend. At the time of the murder, defendant's children were asleep in the apartment and defendant also attempted to assault their mother, his ex-girlfriend. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death penalty. The court considered and dismissed the claims of error raised by defendant. Admission of a pre-sentence investigation report containing statements by the ex-girlfriend and her parents was not prejudicial to defendant. The court independently weighed the evidence disclosed in the record and determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant did not react with sudden passion but after stealthily breaking into the apartment. Finally, the court decided that the sentence of death was appropriate after determining that the sentence was proportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it would not rule on the constitutionality of a statute where other issues could dispose of a case on its merits, and ruled that it was not error to refuse defendant's proposed instructions on &quot;fighting words&quot; because the instructions given to the jury discussed all elements of disorderly conduct including the meaning of &quot;fighting words.&quot; The court found no error in refusing to allow a minister to testify for the purpose of impeaching witnesses because it would have been extrinsic evidence and defendant was not denied his right of confrontation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging the grant of authority to the receiver, the director contended that the trial court unconstitutionally exceeded its authority in rendering its judgment and by rendering orders that were not authorized by Ohio Rev.

Specifically, the director contended that the authority granted to the receiver to hire certain specific staff at specified salary levels, to order payment of the receiver's expenses, and to do the acts set forth in the trial court's orders were not specified in the statute and therefore were contrary to law. The court disagreed, noting that the authority which a common pleas court might confer upon a receiver was very broad. The court further noted that not only was the grant of authority broad, but also that a system of checks and balances was provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.191(B) to insure that the receiver's authority was used properly. The court concluded that the trial judge was not arbitrary nor unconscionable in his appointment of the receiver and, further, in his very specific order granting the receiver those powers deemed necessary to carry out the statutory appointment which he had exercised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the claim based on the statute of limitation contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11, which limited causes of action by minors. During the pendency of the appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B), as applied to minors, did not withstand constitutional scrutiny, and thus, held it to be constitutionally infirm. The practical effect of the holding was to restore the &quot;disabilities&quot; tolling statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16, for minors with malpractice claims. Minors whose causes of action accrued before their majority had until their 19th birthday to commence suit. Application of the four-year statute of limitations found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) to bar a minor's claim for medical malpractice was unconstitutional because it violated the due course of law provisions of the Ohio Constitution. Consequently, the statute of limitations did not bar the minor's medical malpractice claims; and the trial court erred in granting the doctors' motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The Secretary refused the voter's request for additional time to obtain the necessary petition signatures. The trial court denied the voter's complaint for a writ of mandamus.

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court erred in granting an injunction because the evidence was clear that the use of the homes by the residents was for the purposes of occupying a single dwelling unit as a &quot;household&quot; as that term was defined in Westerville, Ohio, City Code &sect; 1105.39; and (2) the city's application of its zoning ordinance was unconstitutional because it discriminated against those individuals who were mentally retarded or who were developmentally disabled.

Township fire protection was provided by contracts with the villages. The villages provide their own police protection and have their own central government facilities. The township trustees sought to transfer surplus funds from the special fire district fund to the township's general fund to help pay for renovations to an old township building. The state tax commissioner approved the transfer, but the common pleas court held a hearing and denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that because the funds were from a special levy they could not be transferred to the general fund. The court found that the need for fire protection had not terminated simply because the year's fire protection had been paid for.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an action against appellees to recover damages for injuries that he sustained in a building that appellees helped erect more than 20 years prior to the commencement of appellant's lawsuit. Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which granted appellees' motions for summary judgment based on the 10-year time limitation prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131, which limited his time for bringing an action against appellees to 10 years after they performed construction services related to the building at issue. The court declared that the statute did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, or result in a denial of due process. Rather, it prevented a cognizable claim from accruing, which the legislature had the right to do in order to further a permissible legislative objective. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131 rationally furthered a legitimate state objective by limiting the duration of liability and reducing the risks of stale litigation. Thus, the court found no error in the trial court's grant of summary judgment to appellees on the basis of &sect; 2305.131.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.323(A)(1). They contended that &sect; 2907.323(A)(1), (B) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were both convicted of violating &sect; 2907.323(A)(1) by photographing three minors in a &quot;state of nudity,&quot; after their motions challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 2907.323(A)(1), (B) were denied. Both were placed on probation. Defendants appealed, contending that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it criminalized conduct that otherwise could be construed as innocent and acceptable. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not overbroad or void for vagueness. The court found that while nudity, without more, was protected expression, the U.S. Supreme Court had held that the State was entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of child pornography because the photographic recording of sexual performances of a child resulted in an invasion of the child's own privacy interests. This was especially so because, where freedom of expression was concerned, the overbreadth of a statute had to be not only real, but substantial as well. Section 2907.323(A)(1), (B) was not substantially overbroad or vague because it proscribed only child nudity that involved lewdness, eroticism, lechery, salaciousness, voyeurism, or other exploitative motivations.</SPAN></P>

The jury recommended the death penalty. The trial court adopted the jury's recommendations and imposed the death sentence. His first convictions were reversed, sentence vacated, and the cause remanded as he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at the first trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the murder or robbery and furthermore, that the facts failed to substantiate that the person who committed the &quot;theft&quot; actually committed aggravated robbery and felony murder, that because the assistant prosecutor made inappropriate comments as his closing argument was winding down prejudiced his right to a fair trial, and that the gun specification included in the aggravated murder indictment but impermissibly submitted to the jury as an aggravating circumstance during the penalty phase in his first trial. The court affirmed the judgment. From the evidence presented, it was unreasonable to infer that anyone other than defendant was connected with the robbery and murder. Because of overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt, as two separate juries found in the case, any error alleged in the assistant prosecutor's argument was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The language in the indictment mirrored that found in the firearm specification statute and the specification was properly submitted to the jury during the guilt phase but not the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband asserted that although he had followed the company procedure during the cutting process he performed, he was struck in the face by a plug and was injured. Appellants contended on appeal that the trial court erred in granting both of the employer's motions because the new, more difficult standard for the &quot;intent&quot; requirement of an intentional tort set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(G), properly applied retroactively to the case, even though the action arose prior to the effective date of the statute. The court disagreed and held that retroactive application of a newly enacted law violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court did find that the trial court erred in applying the new one year statute of limitations period to the case as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A). The court held that under the prior law, the applicable limitation period was two years and appellants' action was timely filed under &sect; 4121.80(A).</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the employer's motion for summary judgment and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that he was harmed after, having reported a defect on a machine that he used in his employ, he was told by his boss that the defect was not dangerous and directed to continue use of the machine. The trial court granted the employer summary judgment finding that the employee's claim was prohibited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, which heightened the requirement for a showing of intent to permit a claim by an employee against his employer for injuries outside of the workers' compensation laws. The court found that the trial court did err by striking the employee's prayer for money damages and jury demand because the amendment to &sect; 4121.80 applying the heightened intent requirement did not apply to the employee's case having been passed after the employee's claim accrued. The trial court judgment was erroneous because the employer failed to establish that the material facts of the case were not in dispute. A question of whether the defect could be foreseen to cause harm presented a question for the trier of fact making summary judgment erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured victim filed an action against the tortfeasors alleging damages that resulted from an intentional assault by the tortfeasors. The trial court granted the tortfeasors' summary judgment motions, finding that the injured victim's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and because the complaint showed that it was filed more than two years after the cause of action had accrued. On appeal, the injured victim argued that the trial court erred when it dismissed his complaint. The court rejected the injured victim's arguments. The court found that the defense of the statute of limitations was not waived in this case, particularly where the complaint indicated clearly on its face that it was filed more than two years after the cause of action had accrued. Thus, although one of the tortfeasors did not specifically raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense, the issue was included within the tortfeasors' defense that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the complaint, on its face, failed to comply with the statute of limitations, which was one-year for an intentional assault.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff filed a motion to dismiss the action, claiming that the deputies had already received their back pay, sick leave, and vacation credit. The court denied the motion and found that it had jurisdiction over the remaining issues not yet decided. The trial court concluded that the deputies were not entitled to interest for the delayed compensation or out of pocket medical and insurance expenses because no statute authorized such payment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a member of a club, committed a series of thefts from six separate affiliated clubs in six separate counties over the course of approximately 18 months.

Defendant was caught in possession of criminal tools in a seventh county and was apparently planning to use these tools to break into and steal from a seventh club. The trial court convicted defendant. Defendant sought review, contending that the indictments for crimes that occurred outside the jurisdiction of the trial court should have been quashed. On review, the court rejected this contention, finding that evidence of the crimes, a notebook which was found in defendant's vehicle, was sufficient to establish a course of criminal conduct under Ohio Rev.

The employee subsequently appealed the commission's determination to the trial court, which affirmed the commission's order. The employee argued that the trial court erred in affirming the commission's order because the board of education did not follow the procedural requirements mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.321. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court found that the board substantially complied with the procedural notification requirements of &sect; 124.321(B), (C) and (D). A letter was sent to the director of the commission, informing the commission of the layoffs. A copy of the board's resolution, enclosed with the letter to the commission, indicated the rationale for the employee's layoff was both a lack of funds and a lack of work.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient engaged the services of the dentist to correct a broken tooth. After treatment by the dentist, the patient continued to have complaints of pain, swelling, and double vision. The patient was treated by a second dentist, who determined that the patient had developed an infection after his treatment by the first dentist. While waiting for a letter from the second dentist as to the treatment administered to him, the patient sent a letter notifying the first dentist that he intended to pursue a malpractice claim against her. Upon receipt of the second dentist's letter, the patient filed a cause of action against the dentist. The court held that the trial court correctly determined that the patient's cause of action was filed more than one year beyond the accrual date. The court found that the patient should have known of the malpractice upon his first visit to the second dentist. The court further held that the &quot;written notice&quot; provision of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Clinton County (Ohio), which granted the summary judgment motion of defendant employer and dismissed the employee's intentional tort action against the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employee slipped on oil at work, he filed an intentional tort action against the employer. He alleged that the employer permitted the oil to accumulate on the floor of its plant with knowledge that the oil accumulation posed a threat of harm to its employees, and that an injury was substantially certain to occur. The employer moved for summary judgment on grounds that it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A), and that the facts did not constitute an intentional tort as defined in &sect; 4121.80(G). The employee contended that &sect; 4121.80 could not be applied retroactively to his cause of action. However, the trial court granted the employer's motion and dismissed the complaint. Reversing, the court held that retroactive application of the one-year statute of limitation violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, because to do so completely extinguished the employee's cause of action without affording him a reasonable time within which to assert it, making the limitations a substantive law. The court similarly found that the retroactive application of the new statutory definition of an intentional tort was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave birth to a daughter while she was incarcerated. The children services board filed a complaint alleging that the child was a dependent child. The trial court held that the child was a dependent child and awarded permanent custody to the State. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute allowing the State to obtain permanent custody over a dependent child whose parent was incarcerated, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.353, conflicted with the adoption statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3107.06 and 3107.07, which prohibited the adoption of a child without an incarcerated parent's consent. The mother argued that this conflict violated her equal protection and due process rights. The court disagreed and reasoned that both statutes placed the welfare of the child first and foremost. Both statutes were concerned with balancing parental rights with the best interests of a child. The provisions did not conflict because, under either statute, parental rights were lost only upon a finding that the parent could not properly raise the child. The court also noted that defendant arguably waived her constitutional argument by failing to raise it in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student consumed two beers while on a college visit before attending wrestling practice. School board policy no. 622 prohibited a student being &quot;under the influence&quot; of illegal drugs or alcohol, and defined &quot;under the influence&quot; to include not only intoxication, but having the effects of consumption of illegal drugs or alcohol, such as reddened eyes and the smell of chemicals. On appeal, the court held that a board of education had broad authority to regulate student conduct so long as such regulation was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The court noted that a student could be suspended for conduct that was not illegal, but was disruptive of school discipline, but could not be suspended for conduct that was not illegal or disruptive. The court found that while the indicia listed in the policy warranted investigation, they did not justify automatic suspension. The court held that the regulation was overly broad in that it did not distinguish between legally prescribed drugs and illegal drugs, and proscribed nervousness, restlessness, or falling asleep/dozing in class. The court held that the policy violated due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband, who was uninsured, died penniless. The hospital filed an action against the wife to recover payment for the deceased husband's bill. The hospital cited Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3103.03, which imposed a duty of support on the husband for the wife and allowed a third party to recover the value of support he had failed to provide. The hospital reasoned that Ohio law was gender-neutral and that the statute should require the wife to pay the bill. The municipal court granted the wife's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court explained that the prerequisite to recovery under &sect; 3103.03 was whether one spouse had in fact neglected to support the other. The statute did not make one spouse liable for necessaries provided to the other spouse, merely because the spouse who received them had failed to pay for them. Applying the Tille doctrine to &sect; 3103.03, the court held that for a third party to recover from one spouse for providing necessaries to the other spouse, the third party at the time of providing those services must have anticipated payment by the spouse against whom recovery is sought, as part of that spouse's obligation of supporting the other spouse.</SPAN></P>

Section 533.16 did not give adequate notice of what conduct was prohibited and made constitutionally protected conduct illegal. The ordinance had a potential chilling effect upon protected speech and assembly in the prospect of a citizen being placed in the expectation of being stopped by an officer and forced to give a satisfactory explanation of his conduct or face arrest.

Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder with two death penalty specifications and of one count of aggravated burglary with a specification of a prior conviction of an aggravated felony. The trial court sentenced defendant to death and to a consecutive prison term. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(F), the three-judge panel found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The trial court did not consider non-statutory aggravating circumstances in setting forth its reasons as to why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating facts. The trial court considered all the evidence presented by defendant in mitigation. Even though the trial court erred in not merging the two death penalty specifications, resentencing was not required because the court, in its independent review, merged the two specifications and determined that the aggravating circumstance found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7) outweighed the mitigating factors. The death penalty was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff manufacturer produced sparklers, novelty, and trick noisemakers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city warned store owners that if they did not remove all sparklers, novelty, and trick noisemakers from their shelves that they would be cited with violations of &sect; 92.01. In its complaint against the city, the manufacturer asserted that &sect; 92.01 violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The trial court found that Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code Gen. Ordinances &sect; 92.01 conflicted with provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3743, which regulated fireworks. On appeal, the court noted that the manufacturer's sparklers, novelty, and trick noisemakers were not contained within the definition of &quot;fireworks&quot; from Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.80. The court rejected the manufacturer's assertion that the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3743 preempted the city's regulation of sparklers, novelty, and trick noisemakers and held that the city was entitled to prohibit, by ordinance, the sale of the items not specifically included in the definition from the state statute. The legislature's exception of sparklers, novelty, and trick noisemakers from the ambit of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.80 was designed to allow local municipalities to regulate those items.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order that granted an injunction to the manufacturer. The court reversed the trial court's order that declared the city ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he argued that &sect; 2921.04 was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 2921.04 failed to establish ascertainable standards of guilt and that it was void for vagueness since the word &quot;intimidate&quot; and the phrase &quot;discharge of his duty&quot; were susceptible to several different interpretations. The court found, however, that impossible standards of specificity were not required, and the test was whether the language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. In reviewing &sect; 2921.04(A), the court found that the language of the statute, when measured by common understanding and practices, conveyed a sufficient, definite warning as to the proscribed conduct that would violate the statute. Furthermore, defendant failed to raise the constitutional vagueness issue at the trial court level. Therefore, the matter failed on appeal since it was waived by defendant.</SPAN></P>

About two and one half years later, the mortgagee initiated garnishment proceedings against the mortgagor grounded upon the mortgagee's deficiency judgment. The trial court dismissed the mortgagee's garnishment action. The mortgagee argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2329.08 was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clauses of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions in that the statute created a class of certain creditors attempting to collect upon homesteads or family dwellings. The court affirmed. The court held that because more than two and one half years elapsed from the confirmation of the judicial sale until the mortgagee instituted its collection efforts, the trial court properly dismissed the garnishment proceedings based upon &sect; 2329.08's clear language. The court reasoned that Ohio appellate courts had affirmed the constitutionality of &sect; 2329.08 many times. The mortgagee had not cited any case that invalidated &sect; 2329.08.

The court stated that an &quot;improvement&quot; was a permanent addition to or betterment of real property that enhanced its capital value and that involved the expenditure of labor or money and was designed to make the property more useful or valuable as distinguished from ordinary repairs.

The court found that there was sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction as to all three counts of the indictment, and thus the trial court did not err in denying his motion for acquittal. The court found that the trial court did not err in determining that the State's witness qualified as an expert because he had the proper schooling or training to qualify. The court determined that the trial court erred in allowing the expert to testify that a &quot;Castle&quot; machine was a game of chance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A student was injured while attending the teacher's class, and filed an action against the teacher and the board of education. The teacher filed an action against the board under &sect; 2744.07(A)(1), (2). The trial court granted summary judgment to the teacher and ordered the board to provide for the teacher's defense and indemnify and hold harmless the teacher in the amount of any judgment rendered in the underlying action other than punitive or exemplary damages. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that, although &sect; 2744.07(A)(1), (2), and Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3313.203 represented a conflict of terms, the legislative intent was to have effect given to both laws. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2744.07 did not impliedly repeal Ohio.  Rev. Code &sect; 3313.203 but, rather, further defined and expanded upon the ultimate objectives of the Ohio legislature. The court noted that there was no reference to the teacher's insurance coverage in the stipulation of facts in the trial court. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2744.07 was expressly made retrospective and that the underlying negligence lawsuit was filed one year after the enactment of &sect; 2744.07.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers disciplined the inmate for his conduct while housed in a correctional facility. The inmate brought an action against the officers alleging that the disciplinary actions taken against him constituted violations of his civil rights.

The trial court granted the motion to dismiss and the inmate appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in dismissing the inmate's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6) on the basis that the officers, as state employees, were immune from the inmate's claims pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.86. The court ruled that no officer or employee was liable in any civil action that arose for damage or injury caused in the performance of his duties, unless the officer's or employee's actions were manifestly outside the scope of his employment or official responsibilities, or unless the officer or employee acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving with a suspended license, reckless operation of a vehicle, and failure to comply with a police officer.

The court ruled that where a motion of a defendant for a directed verdict made at the conclusion of the state's evidence was overruled the defendant had an election either to stand on his exception to the ruling or to proceed with his defense. Further, the court held that the trial court properly construed defendant's refusal to put on any evidence as the defense resting.

The court ruled that in an action by an employee against his employer alleging an intentional tort, upon motion for summary judgment by the defendant employer, the plaintiff employee must set forth specific facts which showed that there was a genuine issue of whether the employer committed an intentional tort against his employee. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that no facts were produced by the employee to show the probability of harm was so substantially certain to occur that an intent to harm could be inferred to the employer.</SPAN></P>

A jury convicted defendant of aggravated robbery and having a gun while under disability. The court affirmed, determining that the State did not have to disclose the identity of an informant who was not a witness to the crime because the informant's testimony was not vital to establishing an element of a crime and there was no indication that the testimony would have been helpful to defendant. Even if defendant's right to confrontation was violated when he was not permitted to inquire as to the woman's address, any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing defendant's request for a second investigator after the trial court authorized payment for the services of one investigator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by police while driving a stolen car. Defendant claimed that his car must have been switched with a stolen car while being repaired. On appeal, defendant argued that he was not brought to trial within the time period required by Ohio's speedy trial statute. The court affirmed the convictions but reversed the sentence for possession of criminal tools. In doing so, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C)(2) made it clear that time was to have been computed starting from the day defendant was arrested on the charges and not on the day defendant was ticketed. The court also held that the State produced sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for receiving stolen property under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 because the car in which defendant was stopped had altered VIN plates, the auto tells had been changed, and the car had been repainted. Also, references to defendant as a liar by the State did not amount to error because defendant admitted he had lied to the police. However, the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to four to 10 years for possession of a criminal tool because said sentence exceeded the maximum for a fourth-degree felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testimony at trial, contradicted only by defendant's testimony, was that the victim, a two-year old, was living with his mother at an apartment, where defendant also resided. Shortly before the date of the offense, the mother kicked defendant out of the apartment for abusing her child. Defendant returned to the apartment, and he was joined by friends a few nights later. The mother heard screaming inside when she stepped outside to attend to one of defendant's friends, who had become ill. Defendant then locked the child in the bathroom with him. The mother found the child undressed with a torn rectum. Defendant was convicted of felonious sexual penetration, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding first that the trial court properly admitted a physician's report into evidence despite the fact that he did not testify at trial. Admission of the medical records was proper under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.422 and did not deny defendant his constitutional right of confrontation. Also, defendant was properly sentenced to life under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.12 where his equal protection rights were not violated. Section 2907.12 treated all offenders alike in terms of sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the Board erred in determining that the company's allocation of domestic expenses to foreign source income for federal income tax purposes was binding upon the company for Ohio franchise tax purposes.

Because the court perceived that the Board entertained the company's appeal as one wherein they were bound by the mechanisms employed under the Internal Revenue Code, admitting evidence and then denying it credibility, the court held that the decision of the Board was unreasonable and unlawful.

The Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered a default judgment against the patient and dismissed the action against the hospital.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nurse contended that the retroactive application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 was unconstitutional. Conversely, on cross-appeal, the hospital argued that &sect; 4121.80 could have been properly applied retrospectively without a denial of due process. The nurse also contended that her negligence claim was not barred by the Workers' Compensation Statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.74. because her cause of action fell within the purview of the dual-capacity doctrine. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 could not be applied retrospectively to bar the cause of action, which arose before the effective date of the statute. The court stated that the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 4121.80 was moot. The court also held that the trial court's failure to consider the nurse's claim under an intentional tort exception the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Statute was improperly prejudicial to the nurse. Finally, the court held that the dual capacity doctrine did not apply because, at the time of her injury, the nurse was performing her duties, which required her to care for all patients assigned to her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners wanted to rezone their property to multi-use property to allow commercial development, which in turn would have increased the value of their land. The court found that the owners failed to demonstrate that the zoning restriction was unconstitutional or unreasonable. The court held that in order to prevail, the owners had to demonstrate to the common pleas court that the zoning provision was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and had no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court also found that the owners' property had not substantially changed since the original zoning ordinance was adopted. There was also no proof that the owners' property was useless for any practicable purpose. The court further found that the owners bought the land as it was presently zoned. Therefore, they knew that if their plans for rezoning failed, they would lose money, and if they succeeded they would have had the potential to make a lot of money. Finally, the court held that the owners failed to demonstrate the zoning resolution was not in accordance with the township's comprehensive guide plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners owned land in an industrial zone. A township zoning ordinance permitted only certain types of industrial activities to be conducted within the zone. Specifically excluded from the zone were residential units and any commercial use that would be hazardous to the public health, safety, or welfare. The legislative intent was for an industrial park in the zone. The owners petitioned the township zoning inspector for permission to open a shooting range on their land. The zoning inspector denied the owners' application, and this decision was affirmed up through the trial court. The owners appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held first that Liverpool Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 303.2 was not unconstitutionally vague. When read in its entirety, it directed that only industrial uses were permitted in an industrial zone. In addition, the fact that there were already non-conforming uses in place did not mean that the resolution violated equal protection and substantive due process guaranties. Finally, there was no taking because the owners did not establish that they could not make viable use of their property in compliance with its zoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed her complaint within 180 days after written notice was given to the dentist informing him that she was considering an action against him. The complaint was filed more than one year after the dentist's services were terminated. According to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A), a malpractice action against a physician, podiatrist, hospital, or dentist was to be brought within one year. Section 2305.11(A) also had an exception wherein an action could be brought within 180 days of written notice being given to the professional. After the patient filed her action, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the extension of the statute of limitations by 180 days did not apply to malpractice claims against dentists. Based on that decision, the trial court granted summary judgment to the dentist. On appeal, the court held that the Ohio Supreme Court decision had retroactive effect. The limitation of the 180-day extension to medical claims was clearly &quot;foreshadowed,&quot; the denial of the extension to dental claims would not &quot;retard&quot; the operation of the new limitations on dental claims, and the retrospective application of the decision would not produce &quot;substantial inequitable results.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) was unconstitutional in preempting local zoning powers, and in violating the &quot;one subject&quot; requirement of Ohio Const. art. II. &sect; 15(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was constructing a hazardous waste facility near the owner's property. The owner brought an action, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the facility was a nuisance, that &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) was an unconstitutional contravention of local zoning laws, and that it violated the &quot;clear title&quot; requirement of the state constitution. The owner also argued that the facility decreased the value of her property, and was a &quot;taking.&quot; The trial court granted summary judgment on all but the nuisance claim, subsequently dismissing that claim for want of prosecution. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the &quot;one subject&quot; requirement of the constitution was not violated by enactment of &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) because a common purpose -- the regulatory scheme for hazardous waste facilities -- existed between the topics in the statute; 2) the statute had not unconstitutionally preempted local zoning laws, as the General Assembly, which bestowed zoning powers upon townships, had the power to limit those powers; and 3) there was no &quot;taking&quot; of the owner's property, as she had not alleged that she had been or would be physically displaced from her property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants had applied for a zoning change.

The applicants contended that the referendum petition was defective in that it failed to comply with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12(H). In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the referendum petition substantially complied with &sect; 519.12(H). The use of the word &quot;map&quot; rather than &quot;plan&quot; in the referendum petition was immaterial. The expanded description in the referendum petition was not confusing, ambiguous, or misleading. Finally, the board of elections was justified in omitting the rezoning application number from the referendum petition because it did not identify the proposal and it did not furnish a name by which the proposal was known.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and the court reversed and remanded the case. The court first noted that the Ohio Capital Punishment Act was constitutional and rejected defendant's jury death qualification arguments. The court, however, found that the record did not support a conviction of kidnapping by deception, defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.01(A). The court ruled that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A) motion with respect to aggravated murder. The court also held that the admission of evidence of prior kidnapping and rape was improperly admitted in violation of Ohio R. Evid. 403(A), prejudiced defendant, and warranted reversal. The State also violated Ohio R. Evid. 609(C) by impeaching defendant with a conviction that was reversed on appeal. Similarly, the State's remarks during trial, closing, and the penalty phase, including references to acquitted charges, prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were in the construction trades and were denied benefits that were provided to other city employees. The employees filed an action that sought payment for those benefits that were denied to them, including sick leave, and vacation and holiday pay.

The city appealed and the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that a genuine issue of fact did exist and that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the employees on equal protection grounds. The employees had established the disparity in fringe benefits among the city's employees, but they failed to establish whether that disparity was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Without such a showing, a material issue existed as to whether the city had a rational basis for treating its employees differently. The court also agreed with the city that the court erred in finding that the denial of the employees' vacation pay was unconstitutional, when in fact the city mayor was exercising discretion conferred by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, which granted defendant employer summary judgment in her intentional tort action to recover damages for an employee's personal injuries and wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured when he fell from a scaffold while he was working for the employer. He died as a result of the injuries. The administratrix filed an action against the employer, alleging intentional tort. The employer filed a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the motion. The court held that the attempted retroactive application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 violated Ohio Const. &sect; 28, art. II. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 fundamentally altered the substantive cause of action by changing the elements of what one had to prove in order to obtain relief. The circumstances disclosed by the record presented a factual dispute, and the employer was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Its conduct could be characterized as an intentional tort. There was evidence to the effect that the employer knew that a cover was intended to protect employees from exactly the kind of injury that the employee suffered. There was also evidence that it knew that the degree of risk posed to employees by the removal of the cover was extremely high and that no warnings were issued to employees concerning the risk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed an action against defendant city in the Wood County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) to have sewer agreements with the city declared unlawful and unconstitutional and for injunctive relief. The trial court ruled that the city could require annexation as a condition precedent to extension of sewer service, but that it was inequitable to require new users to have their land annexed. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' agreement with the city required them to sign an annexation petition in order to tap into the city's sewer lines. The property owners withdrew their names from the annexation petition and the city counterclaimed for breach of contract. Upon motions for summary judgment filed by both sides, the trial court ruled that the city was not required to provide sewer service outside its corporate limits and could require annexation as a condition precedent to such extension of service. The trial court also found that it was inequitable to require new users to have their land annexed when previous users did not. The court held that the city could legally impose an annexation requirement on non-resident users and that a taking of property did not occur. The court further held that there was a rational basis for distinguishing between users already connected to the sewer system and future users. The court concluded that the facts of the case did not warrant application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel and that the mere fact that the city had not required annexation in the past was insufficient to bar it from doing so now.</SPAN></P>

In a subsequent search, the officers discovered several more plants. At trial, the officers testified that defendant stated, at the time of his arrest, that he believed that he was entitled to grow a small amount of marijuana for his personal use. Defendant objected to the admission of such statement because he had not been provided with a written copy of the statement. The court determined that defendant's statement was not discoverable under Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(a)(ii) because the statement was made to a third party rather than the result of interrogation by a law enforcement official. The court determined that even if the trial court erred in admitting the search warrant, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In response to an argument, defendant began shooting at his neighbors, killing two and wounding three.

The court determined that even if defendant had shown that he acted while under the influence of a sudden passion or a sudden fit of rage brought on by anger at his neighbors, nothing the neighbors did was reasonably sufficient to incite defendant into using deadly force. Thus, the trial court properly refused the requested instruction. The court found that the trial court correctly determined that defendant had the burden of proving the existence of mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence before such circumstances could have been weighed against aggravating factors. The court further concluded that the trial court properly enter an order excluding a juror on the ground that the juror testified that he believed defendant was not guilty.</SPAN></P>

The roofer claimed statutory and constitutional immunity under workers' compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Third-party plaintiffs and wrongful death defendants, the construction contractor and shopping center that contracted for a remodeling job, brought the subcontractor roofer into the suit resulting from a roofing employee's accidental death. The wrongful death suit alleged that the death resulted from defendants' negligence. Summary judgment for the roofer was based on an employer's statutory and constitutional immunity under Ohio Workers' Compensation law. The contractor and shopping center opposed summary judgment, arguing that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the roofer had such immunity and whether it was contractually obligated to indemnify them for the fatal injury. The court affirmed. A blanket indemnity agreement was void. The roofer had no liability to the wrongful death claimant. The contractor and shopping center argued that he had failed to warn his employees of the danger and concealed it from them. But his actions were not tortious; they were meant to keep them from harm. There was no right to contribution or indemnity from the roofer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment for the roofer was affirmed as he did not commit an intentional tort, so no issue of material fact existed. All of his actions were done to prevent harm to his men, not to intentionally cause them harm. The agreement was void as against public policy and was insufficiently specific to be an effective waiver of employer immunity.</SPAN></P>

Defendants successfully asserted that res judicata and the statute of limitations barred the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter gave up his regular job when he was hired as a fulltime probationary fireman. He was fired during the probationary period. After the firefighter unsuccessfully challenged his discharge before the civil service commission and a common pleas court, he filed the action and alleged breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, age discrimination, violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, intentional infliction of emotional injury, and promissory estoppel. In reversing the summary judgment entered for defendants, the court held that the previous administrative appeal and the subsequent judicial review pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2506.01-2506.04 did not preclude the action under the doctrine of res judicata. The commission had determined only that proper procedures had been followed in terminating the firefighter and the reviewing court was limited to deciding only whether that decision was arbitrary and capricious. Thus the prior appeal did not involve a determination of the substantive issues raised in the action. The trial court had not clearly granted summary judgment as to the statute of limitations claim and the issue was still pending.</SPAN></P>

Testimony admitted under the business exception to the hearsay rule from a witness who was not the custodian of the records was proper because he was a qualified witness. There was no error in permitting telephonic identification of appellant because the evidence reasonably identified appellant as a party to the telephone conversation. Admission of evidence from appellant's bankruptcy trustee was not prejudicial because the remaining evidence proved her control over the business. Inquiry into one witness' bias was made on cross-examination. Thus, the evidence that was excluded on this issue was cumulative. None of the prosecutor's actions complained of amounted to misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convict sought review of a judgment of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted the motion to dismiss of appellee Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction on res judicata and standing grounds. The convict had filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.01, 2925.02(A)(3) were unconstitutional and void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convict was attempting to use the civil declaratory judgment action to seek post-conviction relief. The convict had already exhausted a direct appeal and petitions for post-conviction relief and habeas corpus. The trial court sustained the Department's motion to dismiss on the basis of res judicata and a lack of standing. The Department had answered the complaint denying that &sect; 2925.02(A)(3) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 were unconstitutionally vague. After the convict filed written interrogatories, the Department filed a motion for a protective order to stay the convict's discovery and also filed an Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B) motion to dismiss. The convict contended that the trial court erred in granting the Department's motion to dismiss because the claim he asserted was not actionable until 1982. Upon review, the convict was barred from now raising that issue because it should have been raised on his direct appeal. Moreover, the convict did not raise the issue in his first petition for post-conviction relief field in 1983. The merits of the convict's claim related to a 1978 conviction; thus, he is not now threatened by anyone who had the power to prosecute him.</SPAN></P>

The printouts were discovered and defendant and his former co-worker were charged with theft in office. The co-worker entered into a plea agreement and testified against defendant. Defendant appealed his subsequent conviction, and appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that defendant's attorney had not represented the co-worker, and thus defendant received effective assistance of counsel. The court further held that the indictment set forth all the essential elements of the offense and that the weight of the evidence supported defendant's conviction through an accountability theory. Finally, the court held that defendant was properly convicted of possession of criminal tools because, as an accomplice, he knew that his co-worker would utilize the computer to unlawfully access the LEADS information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the judgments of the Erie County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) which dismissed her declaratory judgment action and tort action, and two orders of the Erie County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division (Ohio) which approved the settlement of a wrongful death action and the distribution allocation of the wrongful death settlement proceeds. The mother's son was killed in an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the mother's &quot;emotional injury&quot; was suffered when she was informed of her son's death sometime after the automobile accident in which he died. The court held that the law did not provide a remedy for such suffering because the plaintiff was required to be, at least, a bystander, in order to state a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court held that the common pleas court was without jurisdiction and properly dismissed the mother's declaratory judgment action after the probate court took jurisdiction and decided the matter. The court ruled that the insurance coverage limit was $ 100,000 and not $ 300,000, and therefore found that the probate court did not abuse its discretion in approving a $ 90,000 settlement. Stacking of wrongful death claims was not permissible where the mother sought to recover under the general liability coverage provision of the tortfeasor's policy and not under her own uninsured/ underinsured coverage. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to support the allocation of four-fifths of the settlement to the deceased's son and one-fifth to the deceased's mother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the probate court, which approved the settlement of a wrongful death action and the distribution allocation of the wrongful death settlement proceeds, were affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed a decision of the Medina County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which convicted defendant of delinquency by virtue of committing criminal mischief pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was at the courthouse for an appointment and was observed by courthouse staff wandering through the courthouse parking lot, looking inside various vehicles, and attempting to open the vehicle doors. Defendant was charged with delinquency by virtue of committing criminal mischief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.07(A)(1). The trial court adjudged him a delinquent and convicted him of violating &sect; 2909.07(A)(1). On appeal, the court reversed on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to show that the statute had been violated. Applying the rule of ejusdem generis to interpret the statute's language, the court determined that defendant's conduct did not rise to the level of a statutory violation where there was no showing of some change in either the physical location or physical condition of the property. The evidence was that defendant had merely peered into the vehicles in controversy and tried the door handles, nothing more. The court refused to consider defendant's constitutional challenge to the statute as the issue was not raised before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of violating &sect; 1301.05(C)(1)(a), (E)(4), due to the apparent general neglect of her real estate, reflecting deterioration and inadequate maintenance and the presence of assorted items littering her property. She appealed, alleging that the code sections were too vague and imprecise to be constitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that to avoid a finding of vagueness, a penal ordinance had to give sufficient warning to permit individuals to conduct themselves so as to avoid the prohibited activity. The mere fact that the building code was not completely self-defining did not make it constitutionally vague. When viewed in the context of the entire ordinance, the phrases &quot;approved coating material&quot; and &quot;conditions reflective of deterioration or inadequate maintenance&quot; did not present a problem of uncertainty. Their meaning was clear and unambiguous and, furthermore, the ordinance listed examples of the prohibited practices. The court further held that, as the prohibition against the accumulation of debris that could be flammable or create a nuisance was clear and unambiguous, no examples of the prohibited debris were required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board determined that the drilling project was in the high school's best interest.

Code Ann. ch. 2506 the decision was not illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable, or unsupported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The court held that the decision was rationally related to the public welfare and based on hazards and safety concerns. The court ruled that the commission was obligated to consider the public welfare pursuant to the city's police powers. The court found that the commission's valid concerns about the drilling were properly supported by the record. The trial court correctly determined that the city ordinances did not prohibit oil and gas production and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.39 authorized a municipality to enact and enforce regulations regarding resource production. The court determined that Ohio Rev.

Defendant's request for a third examination was denied, as was his motion to suppress evidence seized from his apartment and to suppress his oral statement made subsequent to his arrest. After being convicted, defendant filed a motion for new trial, which was denied. The court found that the record revealed that there was very little conflict in the eyewitnesses' testimony regarding both the murder and the events leading to the murder. All of the conflicts concerned collateral matters. Both eyewitnesses saw defendant stab the victim several times. Additionally, their testimony was consistent with the physical evidence. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting only two competency and sanity examinations. The trial court was presented with two consistent expert opinions based upon two separate examinations of defendant's mental condition. Finally, there was overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant visited a colleague in prison, threatening him and his wife if the colleague did not testify the way defendant wanted him to. The colleague's wife corroborated his testimony. Defendant was indicted on charges of intimidation, bribery and perjury. The trial court dismissed the perjury charge pursuant to an Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion. The jury found defendant not guilty on the bribery charge and guilty on the intimidation charge. Defendant filed motions for judgment of acquittal or a new trial based upon the state's alleged failure to disclose exculpatory evidence. The motions were overruled. Defendant's subsequent appeal was dismissed. Defendant's motion for reconsideration was overruled. After being placed on shock probation, defendant was permitted a delayed appeal. The court affirmed and held that there was no violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, because he had engaged in a vigorous cross-examination of his colleague in order to impeach his character and credibility. The court noted that the prosecutor's argument was neither &quot;egregious&quot; nor sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence because defendant's failure to stay within a marked lane when it was practicable for him to do so, in violation of Ohio Rev.

The court held as follows: (1) the trial court correctly defined cohabitation and properly applied the facts of the case in finding that there was no cohabitation between the ex-wife and the man; (2) although the intent of the parties was considered, it was not the only element of cohabitation upon which the trial court based its decision; (3) the trial court properly considered whether the parties were living together as man and wife while keeping in mind that the germane issue in such a hearing was whether the party in question, by voluntarily undertaking certain aspects of a continuing relationship, thereby assumed obligations equivalent to those of a ceremonial marriage; and (4) the trial court correctly considered whether the alimony continued to satisfy the requirements of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accident victim was injured while riding as a passenger in a car that lost control after attempting to pass defendant policeman. Plaintiff brought an action in negligence against defendant policeman and defendant city. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of defendants on the issue of negligence, finding that defendant policeman was not negligent as a matter of law. The trial court found that, although defendant policeman had a duty to keep a lookout, there was no evidence presented to indicate that this duty was breached. On appeal, the court reversed and held that whether defendant policeman was, or should have been, aware of the passing vehicle, attempted to prevent the driver from passing, and failed to exercise ordinary care once he became aware of impending peril, were questions for a jury. The court further held that the retroactive application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(C)(2)(c), which plaintiff claimed unconstitutionally impaired his vested rights to have a jury determine the damages issue by authorizing the &quot;court&quot; to determine damages, could be construed to include a jury as the decisionmaker on that issue.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the expert testified that the test results differed depending on whether a person was an alcoholic, whether food was ingested, the weight of the person, and the person's gender. The court held that the discussion of alcoholism was not misleading or prejudicial. The court found that no evidence was offered to show that defendant was an alcoholic. Further, the court ruled that the reliability of a Breathalyzer test was not subject to challenge. The court found that an officer who testified concerning the calibration testified that the machine was calibrated once a week during the time it was in use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers arrested defendant for a sale of alcohol to a minor after he told police officers of the sale and described the seller. Affirming, the court said that there was substantial credible evidence of identification to support the conviction. The minor had problems testifying about the seller's identity, but he said that he gave the officers a description of the seller. The officers arrested the person in the store matching the description, defendant. The law was facially constitutional and gave a person of ordinary intelligence adequate notice of proscribed conduct. The court did not apply the law in an unconstitutional manner. Defendant's claim that she could not be guilty of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.24(A)(2) where the minor was not unruly because he was under the control of the police failed. The State did not need to prove unruliness to obtain a conviction. Defendant did not properly raise the affirmative defense of entrapment. Her defense at the trial was that her sister made the sale.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was granted a variance permitting him to construct a commercial grain elevator. The property owners transferred the subject property to a bank by quit claim deed in lieu of foreclosure. Appellees requested a continuance of the variance, which the board denied. Appellees did not appeal the denial of the variance but filed a complaint. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction granting appellees the right to operate the property as a commercial grain elevator and restraining appellants from interfering with or penalizing appellees for such operation. Appellants sought review and the court held that the trial court erred in holding that the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 519.21(A) exception was applicable where the commercial elevator was not incident to the use for agricultural purposes of the land on which it was located. The court held that the grant of a variance by a board runs with the land, and was not a personal license given to the grantor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cable television operator appealed a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff contractor in the contractor's action for foreclosure on a mechanic's lien. The contractor requested the awarding of attorney's fees pursuant to Ohio. R. App. P. 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor delivered concrete as requested by the cable television operator. The contractor brought an action against the cable television operator for foreclosure on a mechanic's lien. The trial court granted summary judgment to the contractor. The cable television operator appealed, contending that there was a genuine issue of material fact, and that, in any event, the contractor was not entitled to interest. On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that because the trial court's judgment foreclosing a mechanic's lien was an action in rem, it was not within the scope of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03, and that it was therefore contrary to law for the trial court to include interest within the scope of the lien. The cable television operator never contradicted that the concrete was, in fact, delivered to the real estate as requested. The cable television operator had no notice that the interest would be included within the scope of the lien until the trial court's judgment so provided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's judgment to exclude interest and, as modified, affirmed the trial court's judgment, which had awarded summary judgment in favor of the contractor in its action against the cable television operator to foreclose a mechanics' lien. The court denied the contractor's motion for an award of attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.02, the Board filed in the trial court the property owner's request for a variance, the notices of hearing, the minutes of the meetings, and its decision. The property owner did not file an affidavit, assignments of error, or brief within the time required by Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 28; however, in his notice of appeal to the trial court, the property owner argued, among other things, that Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect;&sect; 1163.01(f) and 1171.03(b) were unconstitutional. The court held that the failure of the trial court to hold a hearing on the property owner's constitutional claim was error because the notice of appeal properly brought the claim to the trial court's attention, and the Board could not have addressed it. Further, the court found that the property owner was entitled to a hearing on his other assignments of error because the Board breached its duty to file a transcript as required by Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the instructions given to the jury were prejudicially misleading, and that the instructions he requested would have rectified the error. The court noted that a defendant was entitled to have his instructions included in the charge to the jury only when they were a correct statement of the law, pertinent, and not included in substance in the general charge. The court held that the trial court's instructions on proximate cause were a correct, complete, and unambiguous statement of the law and that defendant's request was an incorrect statement of law. Even assuming that the statements were inconsistent in the police report, the court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to refuse to admit the police report into evidence. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16(C) was properly applied to permanently revoke defendant's operator's license following his conviction of vehicular homicide while under the influence of alcohol. The court affirmed the judgment in part, but reversed the order of restitution for funeral expenses and medical bills of the deceased because the term &quot;property damage&quot; excluded these kinds of expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After she was arrested and charged with DUI, defendant filed a stipulation of evidence in which she admitted that she had submitted to a breathalyzer test and that her test result exceeded .18 of one gram by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Based upon the stipulation, the trial court found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in convicting her under &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) because it was unconstitutional. She contended that the test utilized by the State to determine the amount of alcohol in a person's body was scientifically inaccurate and that the evidence was insufficient to convict her. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that, even if defendant were correct that the test was scientifically inaccurate, it would not prove the statute unconstitutional. Moreover, defendant's argument simply challenged the means by which a violation of &sect; 4511.19 could be proven.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for robbery, aggravated robbery, and possession of criminal tools in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio). Defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional rights by ineffective assistance of counsel, that his motions to suppress evidence were improperly denied, and that his offenses did not constitute aggravated robbery and possession of criminal tools because there was no separate animus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Victims were robbed, and they described their assailant to police. Defendant was spotted running, and he fit the description, so the police pursued and captured him. Defendant was arrested, and a knife and other evidence were seized. Defendant was indicted for aggravated robbery and possession of criminal tools, and he was convicted of robbery, aggravated robbery, and possession of criminal tools. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed the convictions for robbery and possession of criminal tools. Aggravated robbery with a knife and possession of the knife as a criminal tool were allied offenses of similar import, and there was no separate animus permitting a separate conviction. In addition, the trial court instructed the jury on robbery, but robbery was not a lesser included offense of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01(A)(1). Although defendant did not object to this instruction, defendant was severely prejudiced by it because he was convicted of an offense for which he was never indicted. Accordingly, under Ohio R. Crim. P. 52(B), there was plain error requiring reversal. However, counsel was not ineffective, and the motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions for robbery and for possession of criminal tools, but it affirmed the conviction and sentence for aggravated robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist claimed that the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint for declaratory relief because he did not join the Ohio Attorney General. Since the motorist's complaint for declaratory judgment alleged, inter alia, that a statute was unconstitutional, the trial court properly dismissed the action for failure to serve the Attorney General, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. The motorist argued it was improper to dismiss his declaratory judgment action in its entirety because he was not afforded a hearing on the merits of two of the three counts in the action. No matter what did or did not occur at the preliminary hearing, there was no escaping the fact that the motorist did not comply with &sect; 2721.12, a jurisdictional requirement. His argument that it was improper to dismiss the declaratory judgment action in its entirety was misplaced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest in the Court of Common Pleas, County of Summit, Ohio, to illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.323. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 2907.323(A)(1) was unconstitutional. The court first held that in light of the State's compelling interest in protecting children from abuse and exploitation, &sect; 2907.323(A)(1) was not overbroad. The proscription against the depictions of minors in a state of nudity, as &quot;nudity&quot; was defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(H), did not infringe upon First Amendment rights in light of this compelling interest. Furthermore, the court stated, the depictions proscribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.323(A)(1) did not have to be limited to lewd exhibition of the genitals, although a number of the pictures in this case did constitute lewd exhibition of the genitals. Depictions of other parts of the anatomy could involve abuse and exploitation. Next, the court noted that another court of appeals had found &sect; 2907.323 void for vagueness. Because the Ohio Supreme Court had reversed this decision, there were no grounds for defendant's challenge based on vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the seat belt law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.263 constitutional and overruled the driver's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was clocked by aircraft on an interstate at 77 miles per hour in a posted 55 miles per hour speed zone. The driver was flagged over by a trooper, he slowed down but continued driving, and a second trooper finally stopped him. That trooper observed that the driver did not have his seat belt buckled. Error allegedly existed in not finding &sect; 4513.263&nbsp;unconstitutional because it was an unreasonable extension of police power and a denial of due process of law where it was discriminatory in nature and violative of both federal and state constitutions. The driver cited a case declaring the motorcycle helmet law unconstitutional because it was an unreasonable extension of police power by compelling behavior by an individual that would benefit the individual alone and not the public good. The driver argued that the same reasoning applied to the seat belt law. The court disagreed. Section 4513.263 was legislation promoting the State's interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and a proper exercise of the State's police power. Results of deaths or severe injures often led to the State's providing long-term care at taxpayers' expense to those injured.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the trial court, which convicted defendant in the death of her two-year old son. Defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter while committing or attempting to commit a felony, but as a result of a plea bargain entered a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense. Defendant challenged the trial court's refusal to disclose to her the contents of the presentence report prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court's refusal to disclose the presentence report violated her right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, citing a United States Supreme Court case. She further argued that Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.2(C)(1) was unconstitutional because it prohibited disclosure of a presentence report. The court rejected defendant's arguments, noting that the Supreme Court case cited by defendant held that in capital cases, the unique nature of the death penalty required that a presentence report be disclosed to insure that death was the appropriate punishment. Moreover, that case did not hold that failure to disclose a presentence report to a defendant in a noncapital case violated due process. The court noted that defendant's case was noncapital. The court also rejected defendant's citations to state cases in support of her contention that a presentence report was required to be disclosed to a criminal defendant, noting that in each of those states, criminal rules or statutes required such disclosure. Ohio R. Crim. P. made disclosure of a presentence report discretionary except in cases of aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of an urban renewal plan the city adopted Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code of General Ordinances &sect; 27172 which allowed the city to appropriate property in certain downtown areas that were blighted. The property owner's building and land were so appropriated. He objected to the city's action. The trial court upheld the city's right to make the appropriation. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the city's plan to appropriate blighted or deteriorating land for urban renewal was conducive to the public welfare and constituted a public use under Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect;19. The record supported a finding that the property owner's building was blighted and deteriorating. Because the property owner's tenant who rented the building was a commercial tenant Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code of General Ordinances &sect; 40.12(B) did not apply. The property owner suffered no concrete injury from the lack of a relocation plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted on various counts of illegal processing of drug documents prescribing pentazocine, which was placed on the controlled substance schedules pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.43. That section provided that when the United States Attorney General determined under the federal act that a drug should be scheduled, the drug was automatically placed on the corresponding Ohio schedule. Defendants sought to dismiss the charges against them on the ground that &sect; 3719.43 was an unconstitutional delegation of Ohio legislative authority. The trial court granted defendants' motions and the court reversed, finding that &sect; 3719.43 was constitutional. It held that because the federal act set forth identical standards for classification of drugs as the Ohio act did under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44, the Attorney General complied with the limitations set by the Ohio legislature when he acted within the limitations set by Congress. Further, to ensure that the Attorney General's classifications did in fact measure up to the standards that the Ohio and federal acts, the legislature also provided for review and amendment of the Ohio schedules by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the husband's complaint was filed beyond the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10. The court found that the savings provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15 did not toll the statute of limitations. The court concluded that tolling the statute of limitations indefinitely with respect to a foreign corporation not licensed to do business in the State of Ohio would result in an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.19 did not save the husband's claims for wrongful death and loss of consortium because the voluntary dismissal of his original complaint was prior to the expiration of the relevant statutory limitation periods for both causes of action.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 29O3.O1(B), and aggravated robbery under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01. Defendant appealed, arguing that his conviction for aggravated murder with an aggravated robbery specification was not supported by sufficient evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because there was no evidence of his intent to commit a theft at the time the murder was committed. The court ruled that in analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence the trial court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the state and determine whether the state presented sufficient evidence on the essential elements of the crime. Further, the court held that intent to commit theft need not be proven by direct, positive evidence but could be inferred from the facts and circumstances presented. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the murder defendant intended to take control of the victim's house and car.</SPAN></P>

She argued that Stark County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 21(A) was in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03. Alternatively, appellant sought leave to comply tardily with Stark County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 21(A). The trial court found no conflict between Rule 31 and the Ohio Revised Code. The court agreed with the trial court that there was nothing inconsistent between the provisions of Stark County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 21(A) and the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03. Stark County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 21 did not alter the legal position of the parties from that contemplated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03. However, the trial court did abuse its discretion when it imposed the most severe sanction of dismissing appellant's claim because there was no evidence that appellant flagrantly and substantially disregarded the requirements of Stark County, Ohio, Ct.

Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it did not provide sufficient warning as to what type of conduct was prohibited. The court held that a party had adequate notice that if he used a &quot;Castle&quot; video-type machine in connection with proscribed Ohio gambling activity, that he could also be charged under &sect; 2923.24 with possession of criminal tools. The language of &sect; 2923.24 was sufficient to convey a definite warning of the prohibited conduct when measured against common understanding and practice and when read in conjunction with the Ohio gambling statutes. The court further held that although the gambling machines were not introduced into evidence, there was adequate testimonial evidence to establish both the existence and nature of the machines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the court of common pleas (Ohio), convicting him of two counts of aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of: two counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications, namely, the killing of a witness pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7), as well as gun and aggravated violence specifications; aggravated burglary with gun and aggravated violence specifications; receiving stolen property with a violence specification; and having a weapon while under a disability with a gun specification. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that defendant was entitled to a new trial on the aggravated burglary and felony murder charges because the trial court failed to list the possible felonies that could have constituted the element of the underlying burglary offense even though the jury asked several questions of the trial judge indicating its confusion. Other evidence of murder was too weak to admit defendant's prior conviction for homicide without a cautionary instruction. Further, the murder convictions should have been merged. The court also reviewed numerous pretrial, trial, and post-trial rulings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance that required solid waste facility operators to be subject to continuing inspection and to deposit in an escrow account six percent of the facility's operating costs in order to offset the city's cost of inspection and supervision. The ordinance also provided that additional funds could be collected from the facilities if the city's expenses exceeded six percent. The operator filed an action for a judgment declaring the ordinance an improper exercise of the city's police power. The trial court granted the city's summary judgment motion. On appeal, the court held that several of the ordinance's requirements could conflict with statutory regulations. However, the court found no that no evidence was presented clarifying the terms of the ordinance. The court stated that because there was a need to resolve certain factual issues found in the comparison of the ordinance and statutory regulations, it had to refrain from addressing the operator's constitutional issues. The court concluded that there was a genuine issue of fact that could be determined only by an evidentiary hearing concerning the inspection fees, which on its face appeared to be excessive.</SPAN></P>

Instead of approving the petitions, the board sought a declaratory judgment and named the city and the agricultural society as defendants. Following the hearing, but prior to the rendering of a judgment by the trial court, the legislature enacted H.B. 981, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), which amended &sect; 709.16. The trial court held that the statute was procedural in nature and held that it should, therefore, be applied retroactively. The court reversed, concluding that (1) Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 precluded retroactive application of the new enactment which made the approval of the annexation by the board discretionary as opposed to mandatory; (2) the city had a vested right to have its petitions approved; and (3) the society had no ownership interest in the fairgrounds property but only the right to manage and control the land and improvements on the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the decisions of the Board of County Commissioners of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which granted a petition of appellees, a city and landowners, for annexation of a township. Appellant also sought review of an order of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, which denied its motion for an injunction to prevent appellee from accepting the annexation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowners argued that the appeal of the injunction action was barred by appellant's voluntary stipulation to its dismissal below. Appellant argued that tenants-in-common of a single parcel had erroneously been allowed three annexation votes. Appellant also argued that the trial court should have held a hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03 and allowed appellant to cross-examine the persons whose affidavits were considered by the board. The court dismissed the appeal of the injunction action due to the stipulation and reversed the decision of the board. The tenants-in-common were properly allowed the three votes because they were each adult owners of township property in fee simple and owned a freehold estate. However, because appellant was not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the persons whose affidavits were considered by the board, the case fell under the &sect; 2506.03(B)(3) exception that the trial court had limited review. Most of the evidence relied on by the board was contained in the affidavits, and any impeachment of those affiants as to their motivation and intentions could have had an impact as to whether the board's finding was supported.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal of the injunction order. The court reversed and remanded the decision of the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Miamisburg Municipal Court (Ohio), which dismissed speeding charges against defendant. She filed a motion to dismiss the State's appeal on the ground that the State did not have such a right because the dismissal of the charges resulted from a trial on the merits. The State claimed that it was entitled to an appeal as of right and requested leave to appeal in the alternative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant had argued that the speed limit posted at the time she received her ticket was not a legally posted limit. The trial court dismissed the charges, holding that the speed limit was improperly changed from 55 to 25 miles per hour. The State appealed, and defendant argued that the State had no right to an appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67 because the charges were dismissed after a trial on the merits. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the decision of the trial court resulted from a complete trial and was tantamount to a verdict of acquittal. As such, the trial court's decision operated as a bar to further prosecution under the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Jeopardy attached when the State's first witness was sworn and began to give his testimony. Defendant did not request termination of the proceedings before conclusion, and the trial court itself did not prematurely terminate the case during trial. The court overruled the State's motion for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the State of Ohio, Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, challenged a judgment from the Ohio Court of Claims requiring the State to apply for a zoning variance to build a reformatory within the boundaries of plaintiff City of Cleveland. Finding that Am. Sub. H.B. 530 (Ohio 1982) and its subsequent amendments, was not a general law, the trial court found Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance No. 1682-86 valid as applied to the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Am. Sub. H.B. 530 (Ohio 1982), as amended, authorized the expenditure of funds for the reformatory to be built. The property was zoned &quot;general industrial&quot; under Cleveland, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 345.04(a), which specifically prohibited the construction of a building for human habitation within a general industrial district. The parties agreed that there was no site within the City appropriately zoned for a correctional facility. On appeal, the State argued that the trial court erred in requiring the State to apply for a zoning variance where the City's zoning code did not permit such a variance to be granted, in holding Am. Sub. H.B. 530 (0hio 1982) not to be a general law, and in dismissing a third party complaint against the City on the basis of lack of jurisdiction. The court held that: (1) the trial court misapplied current case law by requiring that the State comply, not with local zoning restrictions, but, rather, with municipal zoning procedures; and (2) although the city had completely prohibited a certain use within its corporate limits, such prohibition did not operate to prevent the State from performing essential State governmental functions within such corporate limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio), which found that the employee's complaint against appellee employer, alleging an intentional tort, was untimely under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 and therefore dismissed her action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was diagnosed as having ailments of lungs and other organs. Less than a month later, she was terminated from her employment, and she filed an intentional tort action against the employer more than a year after her termination. Prior to the filing of the employee's action, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, governing employer's intentional torts, was passed, and under that statute, the employee's action was required to have been brought within one year. The trial court, therefore, dismissed the employee's action as being untimely filed. On appeal, the court reversed. Under prior law, the employee would have been subject to a two-year statute of limitations. Thus, the change in the limitation period by the adoption of &sect; 4121.80 was procedural. However, retroactive application of &sect; 4121.80 was unconstitutional because the employee had only five days after the effective date of the legislation in which to file suit. Moreover, &sect; 4121.80 changed the elements of what must be proved in employer intentional tort cases, thereby fundamentally altering substantive rights, and consequently retroactive application was unconstitutional under any circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one of his assignment's of error, defendant argued that the jury instruction was faulty because it should have stated, but did not, that the jury was to find defendant guilty of the greater offense before finding mitigation which supported the lesser. The correct rule of law was that a jury was to unanimously agree that defendant was guilty of a particular offense before returning a verdict of guilty on that offense. If a jury was unable to agree unanimously that defendant was guilty of a particular offense, they could proceed to consider a lesser-included offense upon which evidence had been presented. Also, when a jury reached a unanimous determination of guilty to a higher degree of the offense, it could be assumed that they had considered and rejected evidence regarding any defenses or mitigating circumstances. Therefore, the trial judge's instruction that required the jury to cease deliberation once it reached a unanimous determination that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of a higher offense was proper.</SPAN></P>
