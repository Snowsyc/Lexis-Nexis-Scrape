Stat. &sect; 53a-56 and assault in the third degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-61. Defendant sought review of the manslaughter and assault counts. The court held that defendant was properly charged with manslaughter because the legislature included motor vehicles within the definition of &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-56, and specifically excluded deaths caused by vehicles under the negligent homicide statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-58 (a). Further, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-57 only applied to vehicular homicides caused by criminal negligence, whereas defendant's conduct, in which he fled from police with rates of speed up to 60 miles per hour, occurred under a more culpable state of mind of recklessness. The court held that the manslaughter statute was not unconstitutionally vague because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-56 provided defendant with a reasonable opportunity to be aware of the prohibited acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation appealed to the Superior Court (Connecticut) from a decision of defendant tax commissioner, which held that the corporation had underpaid the gross earning tax imposed by Conn.

The corporation argued that moneys collected from consumers for taxes was plainly neither earnings from the sale of petroleum products no did they fall within the &quot;net income&quot; to which &sect; 12-587 applied. The commission argued that the petroleum products tax should have been treated as an item of operating overhead measured in &sect; 12-599(a), by gross earnings derived from the sales of petroleum products in Connecticut. The court determined that moneys collected as a tax from customers was includable in the Connecticut gross earning tax on the sale of petroleum products.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut) that denied motions for acquittal and arrest of judgment after he was found guilty of kidnapping in the second degree, assault in the third degree, and being an accessory to criminally negligent homicide in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-8 and 53a-58.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that there was no such crime as being an accessory to criminally negligent homicide because it was impossible for him to have intended the consequences of criminally negligent homicide. The court rejected the claim because being an accessory to a crime was not itself a crime. Rather, Conn. Gen. Stat. 53a-8 presented another means by which a substantive crime could be committed. Accessorial liability was predicated on defendant's intentionally aiding an accomplice and with the mental culpability required to commit the crime. The circumstantial evidence was sufficient to prove that crime because it showed defendant was bitter about his girlfriend being raped, he purposefully went looking for the perpetrator, encountered the perpetrator, beat him, and gave his accomplice a knife to keep the perpetrator from leaving. Thus, a jury could reasonably have believed that defendant failed to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death could occur. Related to the kidnapping charge, the court's review of the jury instructions as a whole showed that the definitions of &quot;restrain&quot; and &quot;abduct&quot; were not misleading or inadequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a decision by which the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Danbury (Connecticut), upon a jury verdict, convicted defendant of two counts of first degree assault. Defendant claimed, in part: (1) his motion to suppress identification evidence was improperly denied; (2) his right to an impartial jury was violated by the denial of his motion to transfer the case; and (3) the State presented insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A 15-year-old female and a 16-year-old male were viciously assaulted behind a church. The couple was forced at gunpoint by a white assailant to walk to a grassy area where the male victim was handcuffed and his feet were bound. The assailant dragged the female victim down an embankment. During a struggle, the assailant's bandana came off of his face. The assailant beat the female victim with his gun. The assailant choked the male victim until he lost consciousness. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the female victim's identification of the assailant as defendant in a chance encounter of defendant in a department store was not the result of a suggestive identification procedure, thus, there was no constitutional infirmity in the identification process; (2) the female victim's out-of-court and in-court identifications were sufficiently reliable under the totality of the circumstances to be admissible at trial; (3) the publicity attending the case did not deprive defendant of an impartial jury and a fair trial; and (4) the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the perpetrator of the assaults in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), which convicted him of robbery in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to exclude the victim's testimony as to the incident under Conn. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 755 based the destruction of a tape recording of his statements to the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with robbing a store. Shortly after the robbery, the store clerk gave a full account of the incident to the police. The clerk later gave a statement to the police again recounting the incident. The second statement was tape recorded and the tape was transcribed. The tape recording was erased pursuant to a routine police procedure and the transcript was lost prior to trial. The clerk identified defendant as the perpetrator both in court and when he viewed a photo array. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not entitled to have the clerk's testimony excluded under &sect; 755. The court reasoned that although the State was culpable for the unavailability of the tape and transcript, defendant had suffered little if any prejudice from the loss of the tape recorded statement. The court found that defendant knew before trial that the tape and transcript were unavailable, used the State's inability to produce them in an effort to impeach the clerk's testimony, which was consistent with his other statements, and the jury observed the clerk's in court identification of defendant as well as a partial videotape of the incident.</SPAN></P>

The court found nothing in the record to indicate that defendant would have altered his defense if that theory of liability had been included in the indictment. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could find him guilty of felony murder if it found that he or another participant caused the death of the victim in the course of or in furtherance of the robbery or of flight therefrom. The court found that it was error for the trial court to charge in the disjunctive, but held that, given the number of correct explanations of the disputed element of felony murder, the correct explanation at the beginning and end of the initial charge and the recharge, and defendant's failure to take exception, the jury was adequately instructed on the elements of felony murder.</SPAN></P>

The zoning regulations contained a provision which stated that any use of land legally existing at the time of an amendment to the regulations was deemed to be a nonconforming use, and that such use might be continued but might not be extended or expanded.

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. His motion to dismiss based on his alleged illegal warrantless arrest was properly denied because any possible error resulting from the admission of his statements during interrogation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial because the trial court refused to strike testimony regarding blood and semen stains on the victim's coat, which was not retained. The police did not act in bad faith and the stains did not constitute exculpatory evidence. The state's failure to grant immunity to a defense witness did not deprive him of his right to a fair trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a murder case, defendant sought dismissal of the information against him on the ground that the prosecution was barred by the five-year statute of limitations in effect in 1973, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-193. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut) reserved the matter for the advice of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 54-193 prescribed a five-year limitations period for crimes punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, but no limitation period for crimes &quot;punishable by death.&quot; Connecticut's death penalty had been adjudged unconstitutional, but it had never been struck from the books. The State argued that because the murder statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54 prescribed a possible death sentence, a violation of &sect; 53a-54(a)(1) was an offense &quot;punishable by death&quot; for purposes of the statute of limitations. Defendant argued that because he could not constitutionally have been sentenced to death in the year the crime was committed, he was not charged with an offense &quot;punishable by death&quot; for purposes of &sect; 54-193. The court agreed with the State, holding that the phrase &quot;punishable by death&quot; was a shorthand used by the legislature to refer to crimes that were so heinous that no limitations period would be appropriate. The court reasoned that the classification of crimes for statute of limitation purposes arose from the relative gravity of the offenses rather than any inextricable tie to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the statute of limitations did not bar the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder and the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court did not err when it prevented defendant from introducing evidence concerning the murder victim's prior acts of violence and her general reputation for violence. The trial court properly sustained the State's objection to the evidence of the victim's past conduct because of the absence of a claim of self-defense. Although the trial court acceded to defendant's request to charge on manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included offense in the jury instructions, the trial court properly made no reference to the defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The court also found that the evidence of threats made by defendant was relevant to issues of intent and motive. Thus, the trial court reasonably concluded that the probative value of the testimony outweighed its prejudicial tendency. Defendant's constitutional claims were also unpersuasive, because hearsay claims did not automatically invoke constitutional rights to confrontation.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error. Decisional law provided that if the fairness of a subsequent prosecution was not impaired by an illegal arrest, neither the federal nor the Connecticut constitution required dismissal of the charges or a voiding of the resulting conviction. Defendant conceded that the police obtained no evidence as a direct consequence of his arrest. Therefore, the motion to dismiss was properly denied, irrespective of the constitutionality of the arrest. Defendant's arguments against applying decisional law were unavailing. As a rule, judicial decisions applied retroactively. The trial court's refusals to charge on reasonable doubt and on the unreliability of eyewitness identification did not constitute error. Viewing the charges as a whole, the substance of defendant's requested charges was adequately conveyed to the jury. The trial court's charge on alibi witnesses was fair comment to the jury, and the &quot;Chip Smith&quot; charge was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The detainee was the owner of a distributor of bakery ingredients. A shipment of pecans from a pecan company in Georgia was sent to a warehouse for the distributor's account. The detainee was indicted for failure to pay for agricultural products in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 5-9914 and arrested pursuant to a rendition warrant. The trial court denied the detainee's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the detainee argued that his constitutional right to due process was violated by the trial court's failure to consider the constitutionality of the Georgia statute. The court found no error, holding that the trial court properly declined to review the constitutionality of the offense for which he was arrested. The court found that the detainee was substantially charged as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-159 because the indictment, the requisition warrant, and a clerk's certification charged the detainee with committing acts in another state that resulted in the commission of a crime in Georgia. The court found that although some of the extradition papers stated that the detainee was a fugitive, the documents were sufficiently clear that he was a non-fugitive.</SPAN></P>

The father sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the paternity statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, among other things, argued that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of being an accessory to robbery in the second degree.

On appeal, the court held that was not guilty of robbery in the second degree because robbery in the second degree under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-135(a)(1) required that the principal who committed the robbery be aided by another person actually present. Defendant, as the driver of the getaway car, was not actually present during the robbery. While the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction on accessory to robbery in the second degree, it did suffice to sustain a conviction for the lesser-included offense of accessory to robbery in the third degree under Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant objected to the court's instruction that indicated that jurors could draw inferences from circumstantial evidence if the inference asked to be drawn was not only logical and reasonable but was strong enough that jurors could find that it was more probable than not that the fact to be inferred was true. Defendant argued that such a charge unconstitutionally diluted the state's burden of proving the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court agreed. The court determined that the primary issues before the jury were whether defendant intended to cause the victim's death and whether the killing was justified by self-defense. The state argued zealously that defendant intended to kill the victim, asserted that the number and severity of the stab wounds were indicative of intent, and refuted defendant's self-defense claim. The court instructed the jury that the only way to determine intent was to infer it. Having been told that an inference may be drawn when it was more probable than not that the fact inferred was true, the jury was permitted to draw the inference of intent based on the erroneous probability standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree.

On appeal, the court found no error. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-56 in finding &quot;cause&quot; for dismissal after explicitly weighing all of the competing factors proffered by both sides. Even if defendant had been convicted on retrial, further incarceration was improbable, and the state had waited two years after the reversal to initiate the reprosecution of defendant. Defendant had not only served his sentence and been discharged from parole without incident, but he had no other criminal record and was 53 years old. While the trial court gave deference to the State's decision to reprosecute and considered the seriousness of the crime, the balancing process favored defendant in requiring a dismissal of the charge.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the referee erred in deciding that a reduction in budget base and certain repair and maintenance expense reductions were improper because the hospital had adequate notice of those issues. The referee's decisions regarding a salary adjustment, long range planning expense, disallowing certain conditions imposed by the Commission, and the modification of a stay order were not erroneous.

The unions claimed that Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The unions contended that &sect; 4-85(b) had the effect of permitting the governor to veto part of an appropriation; conferred upon the governor legislative power in violation of the separation of powers provision contained in Conn.

Defendants asserted defenses of sovereign immunity and lack of standing. The court found that the case was not barred by sovereign immunity because it presented a significant and substantial question, the determination of which was manifestly in the public interest. The unions had standing to bring the action because they had a colorable claim of direct injury. Section 4-85(b) did not unconstitutionally confer veto power on the governor in circumvention of Conn.

Defendant also contended that he was deprived of his constitutional rights to due process and to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. The court did not agree with the State's argument that a finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing should not be reviewable following conviction at trial. It held that the adversarial probable cause hearing at issue was a critical stage in the prosecution, as well as a jurisdictional prerequisite to continuing prosecution. Absent appellate review of the probable cause determination, the court found that there would be no recourse whatsoever for even the most blatant violation of clear constitutional rights. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding of probable cause. The court also held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-46a(b) was constitutional and that defendant's constitutional rights were not impaired thereunder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged by information with robbery in the first degree and being a persistent dangerous felony offender. He was convicted in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut) and appealed. He claimed error in permitting testimony of a pretrial photo identification and in refusing to suppress the identification, and in denying his motion to dismiss the information as violative of his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As the court found that the totality of the circumstances indicated that the identification testimony was reliable even though the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, the superior court had not erred in permitting the testimony or in not suppressing the identification. As to denial of the motion, the essential difference between Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(a)(4) and &sect; 53a-135(a)(2) was the type of weapon used. The former was limited to firearms; the latter included firearms but was not limited to them. This difference indicated a clear legislative intent to impose a greater penal sanction where robbery was committed with the use of a firearm. Defendant alleged no rational basis for charging him with robbery in the first degree rather than with robbery in the second degree and maintained that such a charge constituted selective and discriminatory prosecution in violation of his equal protection rights. However, as the statutes had not prohibited exactly the same conduct, there was no reasonable basis for a finding that the equal protection clause, Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, had been violated. Thus, the denial of the motion to dismiss the information was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged after a former girlfriend and her family awoke to flames in the front of the house that the victim's son put out with a garden hose. Police and fire officials smelled gasoline, and a plastic container containing gasoline was found under defendant's truck, which was parked 100 yards away. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to a mandatory term, and he appealed. The court affirmed the conviction and remanded the case for resentencing. The trial court properly admitted evidence of prior bad acts in order to prove motive, and balanced the prejudicial effect with its probative value. There was no error in failing to instruct the jury as requested on lesser included offenses because the evidence that differentiated the lesser from the more serious offense was not sufficiently in dispute, and the prosecution had latitude as to how and in what manner it proceeded against defendant. The &quot;Chip Smith&quot; instruction given did not coerce or mislead the jury. The imposition of the mandatory sentence violated defendant's equal protection rights because it resulted in a more severe sentence being required for arson than was required for arson murder, a more serious offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee appealed after the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut) entered a directed verdict in favor of defendant employer in the employee's lawsuit to recover damages for libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The employee contended that the employer lied about the reason for her discharge in a form submitted in connection with the employee's application for unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the job interview, the employee told the employer that her typing skills were not top-notch. About three weeks after she was hired, the employer discharged the employee because she was dissatisfied with the employee's performance, particularly her typing skills. In a statement to the Employment Security Division, the employer stated that she fired the employee because of &quot;unsatisfactory performance and mainly for fraud and lying.&quot; The trial court entered a directed verdict. The court held that the employer had an absolute privilege to state her reasons for discharging the employee in the &quot;factfinding supplement&quot; solicited by the Employment Security Division. That conclusion barred any recovery by the employee even if the court were to have concluded that publication of the statement was libelous per se or that a jury could have found malice. A claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress required proof of extreme and outrageous conduct. The employer's conduct could not be considered outrageous. Moreover, because the employer's comment was absolutely privileged, she would not have been liable for the intentional infliction of emotional distress in any event.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A municipal building official invoked the code's emergency posting procedures after finding that portions of an historic building were in danger of collapse.

The owner alleged that the building official had acted in an arbitrary and discriminatory way after it refused to permit inspections. The trial court found that the building as a whole was structurally sound but that staircases were pulling away from the wall and ceilings were in danger of falling. The trial court denied injunctive relief, finding that no constitutional rights were violated and that the official's actions were warranted. The court held that the trial court's factual findings were not clearly erroneous, that there was no constitutional entitlement to a hearing before summary administrative action in emergency situations, and that there was no violation of equal protection where the owner was afforded chances to repair the building and had not shown that other properties in similar condition were not posted.</SPAN></P>

The court further refused to recognize the father's claims to various credits due to him because the father had testified that he had made direct payments to the mother and that the parties had agreed to forgive a portion of the arrearage. The court found that the father was in fact in arrears and had violated the orders of the trial court.

The court denied certification. Despite the order, the landowners continued to offer live entertainment. The trial court issued an injunction. The court found no error. The zoning plan did not regulate speech on the basis of its content. The regulations prohibited all outdoor entertainment in the residential zone that contained the club. The trial court reasonably concluded that performances at an outdoor amphitheater located in a residential area threatened the quality of life and the safety of the inhabitants of the neighborhood. In the absence of a demonstrated danger that the regulation would significantly impinge upon the First Amendment rights of those not before the court, the landowners had no standing to press a claim of overbreadth. The landowners lacked standing to demand relief under the state constitution because they had not exhausted their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38-175c (a)(1), the coverage issue must be determined by arbitration before review by a court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the requirements for the nomination and appointment of judges did not apply to attorney referees because they were confined to the role of factfinders and they were not empowered to function as judges. The fact that the attorney referee went beyond the bare statutory requirement of reporting the facts found by including his opinion upon the legal issues did not transform his role into a judicial one. The trial court was the effective arbiter of the law, and the legal opinions of the attorney referee carried no weight not justified by their soundness as viewed by the trial court. The court determined that consent of the parties was necessary for a reference to an attorney referee, which removed the essential basis for the obligor's due process challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 52-434. The court found that the failure to obtain the parties' consent was not plain error in light of their failure to protest until the appeal was filed. The court determined that the obligor was precluded from appellate review of alleged errors in the attorney referee's report by its failure to file exceptions to the acceptance of the report by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the victim's virginity prior to the alleged assault, which he argued was relevant to provide an alternative explanation for an injury she suffered during the act of sexual intercourse; in instructing the jury that it could convict him of sexual assault in the first degree if it found that he had compelled the victim by the threat of force; and in refusing his request to charge the jury that sexual assault in the second degree was a lesser-included offense of sexual assault in the first degree. Because defendant failed to establish that the testimony regarding the victim's virginity was relevant to a material issue in the case, he could not complain that his constitutional rights were violated when that testimony was excluded. The court held that defendant's failure to object, coupled with his subsequent failure to except to the disputed instruction, negated his claim of unfair surprise.

Moreover, the victim had had a reasonable opportunity to view defendants as they left her home. Defendants also alleged that the trial court erred in not dismissing the larceny charge because the State failed to prove that the value of the stolen items exceeded the statutory limit. The court found that the State's expert properly appraised the stolen property at market value, rather than replacement value as contended by defendants. Thus, the State established the elements of larceny. The court rejected defendants' claim that the judge improperly commented on facts in evidence, finding that the judge was merely explaining to the jury their role in weighing the reliability of the victim's identification.

The court stated both witnesses were in a position to focus on detail and exhibited a high degree of certainty. The court ruled the crimes of larceny and robbery required proof of different and distinct elements; therefore he was not subjected to jeopardy for the same offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff teacher brought an action for wrongful termination against defendant board. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield (Connecticut) entered judgment, awarding some damages to the teacher but denying his request for reinstatement and additional damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board attempted to terminate the teacher twice. The first attempt was ineffective because the board failed to comply with the procedural requirements prescribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-151(b). At issue was the effect of a subsequent letter indicating termination. The trial court found that the letter effectively reinitiated the statutory termination procedure and had resulted in a valid termination when the teacher failed to request a hearing. The appellate court reversed in part, holding that the initial procedurally defective termination rendered ineffective the subsequent attempt to terminate the contract. As such, the appellate court held that the teacher's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the letter did not preclude him from seeking judicial relief. On further review, the court held the letter effectively reinitiated the termination process and the teacher deliberately chose to not avail himself of the statutory means of redress.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police arrested defendant for breaking into a clothing store and stealing clothing from the racks. Defendant represented himself at trial. The State put in evidence that the value of the stolen clothing was over $ 2,000 in support of the charge of larceny in the first degree. Defendant was convicted of burglary in the third degree and of larceny in the second degree, which required a showing of a theft of items worth more than $ 500. Defendant requested, but was denied, counsel to represent him during the sentencing phase. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, but remanded for resentencing. The court held that the trial court's jury instruction on specific intent, while deficient in isolation because it stated the jury &quot;must find the intent would infer from conduct&quot; for a finding or guilt on burglary, was not error because the trial court also instructed the jury that if it found that defendant had unlawfully entered or remained in the building, but did not possess the intent to commit a crime therein, defendant could not be found guilty of burglary. However, the court remanded because defendant asked for, but did not receive, counsel during the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty of robbery in the first degree. Defendant was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress an out-of-court photographic identification and a subsequent in-court identification. The court agreed with defendant that similar clothing and the recent arrest date in the photograph and the fact that the victim knew a suspect was in custody made the photographic display unnecessarily suggestive. However, the court still held that the victim's identification of defendant was reliable based on the totality of the circumstances. Defendant also contended error in the refusal to instruct the jury adequately on the subject of eyewitness identification. The court reasoned that the photographic identification procedure resulted in a reliable identification, thus it did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification that required suppression of the victim's in-court identification. The court found no error.</SPAN></P>

The trial court gave an instruction on specific intent that was erroneous, but the jury charge also contained numerous statements that clarified or correctly stated the test for specific intent. Defendant was convicted of murder. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the charge was adequate, despite the error, because defendant did not object to the charge and because the charge as a whole negated any potential for misinterpretation of intoxication under &sect; 53a-7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for larceny and for falsely reporting the theft of a motor vehicle. The record showed that defendant's vehicle was found stripped and abandoned in a parking lot. Defendant filed a claim with his insurer and received the fair value of the car.

The officer discovered a number of the missing car parts in that garage. The court affirmed the conviction and concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. The court found not error in the denial of defendant's motion to suppress the evidence found in the garage since defendant failed to sustain his burden of establishing that he had a legitimate privacy interest in the garage. Defendant presented no evidence showing that his use of the garage was exclusive or that he exercised sole control over it.

Defendant filed a motion in limine to prohibit the State from impeaching him with his prior convictions for manslaughter and assault. The superior court denied the motion and convicted defendant. Defendant appealed. The court reversed. Although the prior convictions were potentially admissible under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-145 (1981), the prejudicial effect of the convictions outweighed any probative value as to credibility and should have been excluded because violent crime convictions had no bearing on honesty and veracity. The superior court's instruction that limited the use of the prior conviction was insufficient to overcome the prejudice. The jury was properly instructed that it was permissible to consider defendant's self-interest in weighing his testimony and the evidence of his flight. Defendant failed to prove that it was unconstitutional to convict him as a habitual offender based on one prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

The vehicle swerved off the highway and crashed into the median divider. One victim was injured and the other victim died.

The victim and the administrator filed separate actions against the State alleging that the State negligently constructed and maintained its highways. The actions were consolidated. The victim and administrator alleged that a defect in the state highway was the sole proximate cause of their injuries and death. The trial court held, by jury verdict, that the State was not negligent. The victim and the administrator failed to file a motion to set aside the verdict. The court held that it was not plain error for the trial court to provide its instruction to the jury on proximate cause. The court noted that the trial court's instruction on causation was in accordance with the rule that the parties filing an action against the State must prove that the defective highway was the sole proximate cause of their injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At approximately 10:10 a.m., a farmer saw a heavyset woman with an &quot;unnatural Shirley Temple hairdo&quot; and a mole on her face in a cream-colored car with dealer vanity plate along the side of a country road. At approximately 10:15 a.m., two men robbed a local bank and escaped in a rust-colored Ford. At approximately 10:20 a.m. a witness saw two men get out of a rust-colored car and walk toward the cream-colored car. The farmer later identified defendant as the woman in the cream-colored car while driving with police in a nearby parking lot and from a single photograph, although both viewings were unplanned and did not reveal that defendant had a mole. At trial, the farmer identified defendant as the woman in court. The jury convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree by aiding in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-134(a)(4) and 53a-8. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the in-court identification was proper because the prior viewings were unplanned and did not disclose the mole. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient, and that the trial court's admission of certain evidence and jury instruction on reasonable doubt were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree by aiding after admitting an in-court identification and overruling defendant's challenges to the admission of certain evidence and the jury instruction on reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

He was arrested and blood and pliers was found in his car. During the trial, he offered two alternative defenses, a lack of the requisite intent on his part, and consent on the part of the victim. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the affirmative defense of cohabitation had no bearing as a defense to the charge of sexual assault in the first degree, and in restricting defendant's cross-examination of the victim regarding her prior sexual activities with him. The court held although defendant failed to request a charge, that the sexual assault conviction was reversible because the case fell squarely within the parameters of the plain error doctrine of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 3063. The trial court's mistaken charge failed to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which they might find established. Further, the court found defendant had failed to establish that the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right of confrontation since his counsel terminated the inquiry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court in part, finding error only in the conviction for sexual assault in the first degree. That portion of the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The recreational boaters received infractions complaints during the summer of 1982 for their alleged failure to comply with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-142, which provided for the registration of vessels operating in state waters. The court remanded the action for trial and held that courts were bound never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it and never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than was required by the precise facts to which it was to be applied. The court held that it would not review the facial validity of &sect; 15-142, and the only question which remains was whether that statute had been constitutionally applied. The court held that that determination was dependent to an unusual degree on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. The facts of record in the present matter, however, were insufficient to afford a basis for resolution of the issues presented. It was only where the parties fully and fairly disclosed all of the relevant information that it could perform the careful inquiry and thorough examination required in constitutional determinations.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the trial court. The victim was taken to defendant's housing complex and identified defendant and his accomplice. Later, defendant was taken to the victim's store where the victim identified defendant. The court held that the initial identification at the housing project was not suggestive because defendant stood among a group of people who resembled him in racial makeup when the victim identified him. The court held that the subsequent show-up at the victim's store did not make the identification suggestive. Furthermore, defendant failed to demonstrate the unreliability of the victim's identification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After accepting defendant's conditional plea of nolo contendere to 14 counts of arson murder pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-94a, the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut) entered a judgment of guilty on all 14 counts. Pursuant to the plea, defendant appealed the trial court's denial of his motions to suppress his confession and to dismiss the indictment on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's &sect; 54-94a plea agreement permitted him to challenge on appeal the voluntariness of his confession and also the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, which was based upon the constitutionality of the arson murder statute and the requisite level of scienter needed to sustain a conviction. The court reversed the convictions and remanded the case with instructions to vacate defendant's conditional plea. The court held that a plea induced by a trial court-approved promise that could not be fulfilled was not voluntary. The court found that the issues that were reserved for appeal in the conditional plea agreement did not fall within the ambit of &sect; 54-94a. Defendant's motion to suppress, which implicated U.S. Const. amends. V and VI, was not included in the statutory language of &sect; 54-94a, which allowed appeals only from the denial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained from an illegal search or seizure in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Regarding defendant's motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds, the court found that defendant's reasons were essentially based on speculation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the conviction for the attempted murder of his wife, citing the lack of appointed counsel during an 11-week period. The court found no error in the superior court judgment, holding that defendant's right to assistance of counsel, as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, was not violated by the superior court's failure to appoint counsel, in view of the circumstances. The 11-week period occurred after defendant rejected 3 public defenders, brought a federal action in order to replace one of them, and refused to accept other suggested counsel. Defendant's case also was transferred in order to provide him with another pool of available defense attorneys. Finally, defendant accepted the representation of an attorney who practiced in another jurisdiction and the case, again, was transferred. Defendant's conduct justified the delay and he was not harmed by the hiatus. The court then ruled that defendant waived objection to the jury instruction on the insanity defense by failing to raise the matter at trial. Further, the court rejected defendant's claim that testimony by the court-appointed psychiatrist improperly was admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the trial judge conducted a cross-examination of the only defense witness that served to deprive defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial. The witness was defendant's brother who had pled guilty to the same offenses before the same judge. The judge questioned the brother based on statements he made at his plea hearing at a point when the prosecutor was attempting to impeach his credibility. The judge also questioned the brother about an alleged unidentified participant. The court concluded that the judge's examination could have easily given the jury an impression that he doubted the brother's truthfulness. The examination cast a cloud of judicial skepticism over the brother's testimony and undercut defendant's case. The court therefore held that the denial of defendant's right to a fair trial resulted in prejudice requiring a new trial and reversed the convictions. A curative instruction given by the judge was not in this instance sufficient to cure the impact of the prejudice caused by the judge's questioning. The court also held that the evidence of guilt was sufficient. Therefore it ordered a new trial instead of granting an acquittal.</SPAN></P>

After being read Miranda rights, the suspects admitted they were standing in front of the liquor store. At the station, defendant admitted he had been in the liquor store. Defendant was convicted of attempted robbery in the first degree. The court affirmed. The initial stop of the car was legal. The police saw the blue sweatshirt in defendant's car that matched the description given by the store owner. The police acted lawfully in briefly holding defendant until the store owner positively identified him. The extension of the initial stop was justified once the police found the blue sweatshirt. The identification made by the victim was reliable under the totality of the circumstances; therefore the in-court identification of defendant was admissible.

On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting an in-court identification of defendant by the victim's mother. Defendant argued that an earlier out-of-court identification was unreliable and was based on an unnecessarily suggestive procedure. The court found no error, concluding that the procedures employed by the police were not so impermissibly suggestive as to render the identification unreliable. Additionally, the court found that the identification was reliable under the totality of the circumstances. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in excluding from evidence certain newspaper clippings that were offered to show the bias of defendant's father, the State's chief witness. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the newspaper articles, which announced a reward for information on several murders, were irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was in custody of the trial court for proceedings relating to a pending felony charge. Shortly after defendant's arrival in court, he suddenly ran from the defense table, through the back door of the courtroom, and out of the courthouse. With sheriffs in pursuit, defendant fled to a nearby street where he encountered a woman emerging from her car. Defendant forced her back into the car and drove off with her, threatening to kill her if she did not cooperate. Defednant was later arrested and was convicted of escape from custody and of kidnapping in the first degree. Defendant appealed and claimed that the underlying felony was already complete when the alleged kidnapping began, that defendant lacked the intent necessary for a kidnapping charge, and therefore the kidnapping charge was improper. The court affirmed and held that, where escape from custody was the underlying felony, defendant's intent to continue to elude the pursuit of custodial officers satisfied the intent requirement of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92. The court held that defendant need not have abducted his victim at the very instant he left custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, municipalities, local boards of education, and a state association of education boards, appealed a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain (Connecticut), which ruled in favor of defendants, the State Commissioner of Education and others. The court found an act constitutional which provided for mandatory and final binding arbitration to resolve teacher contract disputes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The municipalities, the boards, and the association had sought declaratory relief, challenging the constitutionality of 1979 Conn. Acts 79-405, amended Conn. Gen.

The trial court ruled in favor of the Commissioner, finding that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court set aside the judgment based on lack of standing. The municipalities failed to exhaust their administrative remedies pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-175, 4-176 on their related nonconstitutional issues and, thus, lacked standing to pursue declaratory relief on their constitutional challenge as well. The boards, like the municipalities, had no standing to challenge legislation enacted by their creator, the state, though they could question the interpretation of an enactment. Local charter powers yielded to the superior power of the state regarding a field of statewide concern. The association could have no standing greater than its members that it represented, the boards, who also lacked standing to challenge the legislation.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the record of the remarks of the trial judge in sentencing defendant did not affirmatively disclose any legitimate reasons for the increased sentence.

Defendant contended that the plea was involuntary, entered without knowledge of the charge, and that it resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied the motion to withdraw and sentenced defendant to 25 years imprisonment. The court held that: (1) original defense counsel was not ineffective because based on defendant's signed and voluntary confession, it was unlikely that he could have successfully claimed a lack of intent for the purposes of reducing his conviction to manslaughter; (2) the trial court properly examined the strength of the State's case in order to determine whether defense counsel had acted competently in advising him to plead guilty; and (3) pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 711(1), the trial court's explanations to defendant regarding the offense, the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, and the State's burden of proof were entirely adequate to ensure that defendant understood the nature of the charge to which his plea was offered.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that there were no circumstances corroborating the informant, except the fact that defendant was at this particular corner when the police arrived there, which the trial court did not consider paramount because defendant had been seen there a half dozen times recently; moreover, defendant worked in that area. The court found that the trial court's decision was correct under either the Gates totality-of-the-circumstances analysis or the Aguilar-Spinelli test. Using the Aguilar-Spinelli test and rejecting the Gates totality-of-the-circumstances test, the court went on to find that the search was improper under the Connecticut Constitution as well.</SPAN></P>

The victim threatened to move away and keep defendant from ever seeing his son again. Defendant then went to the victim's place of work and shot her in the head. She died several days later. Defendant claimed he was suffering from an extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the shooting caused by his fear that he would never see his son again. On appeal, defendant argued that he was unconstitutionally forced to submit to psychiatric examination, and that the State improperly allowed the court-appointed psychiatrist to read a confidential presentence report. Finding no error, the court held that by informing the trial court of his intention to employ the extreme emotional disturbance defense and presenting evidence in support thereof, defendant placed his mental status in issue and the trial court properly directed him to submit to psychiatric examination. The fact that defendant's evidence was not from an expert did not matter. The court found that the psychiatrist's reading of the presentence report was not reversible error because defendant failed to show that it was harmful.</SPAN></P>

Two of the witnesses made pretrial and in-court identifications of defendant. Defendant alleged that he was denied due process of law because the State failed to disclose, prior to trial, that the other two witnesses failed to identify defendant. In affirming defendant's convictions, the court held that there was no constitutional or Brady violation because the nonidentification information was disclosed when those two witnesses testified at trial. Further, defendant made no showing that the disclosure was so late as to prevent him from receiving a fair trial. The trial court did not violate defendant's Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment rights by allowing a witness to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination during his testimony. Defendant failed to preserve the issue by making timely trial objections and the record did not support a claim of constitutional error. In addition, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial after a witness testified that defendant had been incarcerated before trial. The testimony was actually exculpatory because it cast doubt on the key issue of identification.</SPAN></P>

The court found that police involvement was not so extensive as to create an agency relationship between the friend and the police.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 53a-54d provided that the trial court was required to impose a mandatory life sentence without eligibility for parole upon any person convicted of arson murder. The State argued that the trial court erred in suspending defendant's sentence. On appeal, the court held that the legislature's revision of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35a rendered the phrase &quot;shall not be eligible for parole&quot; meaningless because the arson murder statute was placed into a definite sentencing scheme. The court found that the trial court did impose a life sentence. However, there was nothing in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54d prohibiting the trial court from suspending defendant's sentence. Also, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-28(b)(5), a term of life imprisonment suspended after a period was permissible. Moreover, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-25, arson murder was an unclassified felony for which there was no provision prohibiting the suspension of a sentence. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54d, finding that it did not create an irrebutable presumption of intent to cause death in violation of defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officers asserted that a statutory requirement that city employees maintain a residence within the city as a condition of employment with the city was improper. The lower court found in favor of the city. The police officers challenged the decision, contending that the statute's mandatory arbitration provision represented an invalid delegation of legislative power and that the residency requirement was unconstitutional. The court rejected the police officers' contentions, finding that delegation of power to a panel of arbitrators satisfied constitutional requirements concerning the delegation of legislative authority because the statute provided direction to the arbitrators concerning the exercise of the delegated authority and because the statute provided for judicial review of arbitration decisions. The court ruled that the residency requirement did not deprive the police officers of the equal protection of the laws because the requirement was a reasonable exercise of discretion that was closely tailored to governmental interests and because those interests outweighed the liberty interests of the police officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court that found in favor of the city.

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the city, and the owner appealed and claimed that the trial court erred in granting the city's motion to strike the special defense and in ordering summary judgment in favor of the city. The court affirmed and held that, in collection actions pursuant to General Statutes &sect; 12-161, the validity of the tax could not be questioned. The court held that the claim of unlawful assessment raised in the special defense could not properly be raised in an action to collect taxes under &sect; 12-161 because the claim could have been redressed through an appeal from the board of assessors under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that respondent commissioner of correction was confining him illegally. The commissioner appealed after the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut) granted the petition in part. The trial court, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-98, credited petitioner with time spent in a Florida jail awaiting extradition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue presented was whether petitioner was entitled to credit under &sect; 18-98 for 109 days spent in a Florida jail while resisting extradition to Connecticut. The court found that the trial court erred in concluding that &sect; 18-98 authorized credit for 109 days on petitioner's Connecticut criminal sentence. Section 18-98, as written, clearly specified that credit was authorized for someone imprisoned while &quot;awaiting trial&quot; or &quot;awaiting sentencing.&quot; The statute did not specify that credit was authorized for someone &quot;awaiting extradition.&quot; Because the statutory language was clearly expressed, the court found that it had to apply the legislative enactment according to the plain terms and could not read into the statute something that was not there. Given the plain command of &sect; 18-98 that no credit could be given to someone in petitioner's circumstances, and the absence of any legitimate basis suggesting any vindictiveness for petitioner's choice to fight extradition, the court concluded that the commissioner's decision to deny the credit did not contravene petitioners' rights to equal protection or due process of the law under either the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that there was error, therefore, the judgment was vacated and the case was remanded with direction to dismiss petitioner's writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were injured when a car driven by one of the club's patrons collided with plaintiffs' cars, which were parked on the side of the road. The gravamen of the club's evidentiary argument was that there was no evidence sufficient to warrant the jury's finding that the driver was intoxicated at the time the club sold him alcoholic liquor. The evidence showed that the driver had two drinks at lunch on the day of the accident and later in the afternoon was served four drinks by the club. The court concluded that the jury reasonably could have found facts to prove that a state of intoxication existed in the driver at the time of a sale of alcoholic liquor to him by the club and that the state of intoxication continued was a proximate cause of the collision. In addition, the trial court properly struck the club's contributory negligence defense because contributory negligence was not a valid defense to a Dram Shop Act suit. Finally, the trial court properly reduced the amount of the award to the injured parties because the maximum amount recoverable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-102 was $ 20,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the trial court's judgment in favor of the injured parties, or in the reduction of the judgment against the club.</SPAN></P>

In the first case, after a jury trial, defendant was convicted of the crimes of robbery and theft of a firearm.

The court found that defendant was not prejudiced by the State's misplacement of an original composite sketch of the State's suspect in the robbery. The photocopy presented into evidence by the State actually helped defendant's case because the differences between the person portrayed in the photocopied sketch and defendant were more blatant then in the original copy. In addition, the court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a mistrial based upon alleged improper remarks made by the prosecutor. The trial court did not err in allowing a suspect sketch artist testify for the State to help the jury understand the intricacies of a composite sketch. Finally, defendant's conviction as to the pistol charge did not violate his right to double jeopardy following his conviction on the theft of a firearm charge.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant failed to prove that he was denied due process of law. The court found that it was not an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of discretion which led the trial court to appoint a rent receiver and not to allow defendant to collect the rents. The issue of who should be the receiver of rents was an issue of fact. The court found that the foreclosure action constituted a valid exercise of a mortgagee's acceleration right and that defendant had failed to make a tender offer which was unconditional and unqualified.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, commissioner and board, appealed the decision of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury (Connecticut), which entered an injunction in favor of plaintiff employee in his action seeking to enjoin defendants from enforcing the city's involuntary mandatory retirement age for police officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee brought an action against defendants, commissioner and board, to enjoin defendants from forcing him to retire at age 65 from his position as superintendent of the police department. The trial court entered an injunction barring plaintiff's involuntary retirement and held that mandatory retirement would violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA); 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 621 et seq. and the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act (CFEPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-51 et seq. Defendants appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the trial court had no jurisdiction to hear plaintiff's claim because of his failure to invoke his federal or state administrative remedies, and that failure barred him from judicial remedy under both the ADEA and the CFEPA. The court found that plaintiff's complaint did not allege that he gave notice of his age discrimination claim to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the ADEA made such notice a prerequisite to a private action. The court concluded that plaintiff's claim under the CFEPA was flawed because of his failure to file a claim of discrimination with the Connecticut commission on human rights and opportunities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment prohibiting defendants from enforcing mandatory retirement provisions against plaintiff employee and remanded for dismissal because plaintiff failed to notify the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and to bring his complaint to the Connecticut human rights commission, and this failure foreclosed his access to judicial relief. The plaintiff's cross appeal was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a personal injury suit, plaintiff sought review of the order of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Litchfield (Connecticut), which entered judgment on a jury verdict for plaintiff that was lower than that sought by plaintiff in his suit against defendant. Plaintiff contended that the trial court erroneously permitted evidence as to plaintiff's settlement agreement with another defendant, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-216a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a suit arising from a motor vehicle accident, after plaintiff settled his suit against one of two defendants, the other defendant was permitted to question plaintiff in front of the jury on the amount of his settlement. The trial court instructed the jury to subtract the settlement amount from any verdict in favor of plaintiff. Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict for substantially less than the amount plaintiff sought. In reversing, the court held that &sect; 52-216a, which proscribed bringing to the jury's attention any settlement agreement and which set forth the course to be undertaken by the trial court after a jury's verdict, was applicable even though plaintiff's cause of action arose before the applicable date of the statute. Further, the court held that &sect; 52-216a was constitutional under the court's earlier decision declaring the previous version unconstitutional. The court found that by enacting the present statute, the legislature expressed what it intended the trial court to do after a jury verdict by directing the trial court to consider any settlement money paid in making its post-verdict determination on the issue of any claimed excessiveness or inadequacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the trial court's judgment and ordered a new trial limited to the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

He filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination, which was subsequently referred to the commission but not filed until approximately seven months later. The commission dismissed the complaint because it was filed more than 180 days after the date of the alleged discrimination. The employee's petition for reconsideration was denied by the commission, and the trial court dismissed the petition for appeal as having been untimely filed. The employee was mailed the notice of dismissal of his complaint by certified mail, which was sufficient. The method of delivery was more accurate than that which was required. The employee's own inaction in response to actual notice could not be made the basis of a claim that he was not afforded due process. The employee's claim was terminated for failure to comply with the instructions he received at his home to collect an important document from the postal service. He received adequate notice of the dismissal of his complaint; therefore his equal protection claim was unfounded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff state employees and defendant state officials cross appealed from a judgment for defendants by the Superior Court, Harford-New Britain (Connecticut) in plaintiffs' action for, inter alia, a judgment declaring that the pre-1975 State Employees Retirement Act (Act) created a contractual obligation for Connecticut to maintain the pre-1975 retirement ages for female employees who had not begun receiving benefits when the Act was revised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act had originally permitted female employees to retire at age 50 with 25 years of service. To achieve equal treatment of female and male employees, the Act was amended to permit female employees to retire at age 55 with 25 years of service. The trial court concluded that the legislature never intended the Act to create contractual rights in state employees. The employees argued that promissory emanations from the Act of deferred compensation designed to induce state employees to accept and retain public employment, together with reliance on such &quot;promises&quot; by the employee, were sufficient to create a contractual relationship between the state and its employees. The court held that the Act conferred no contractual rights in the statutory pension plan on state employees. A statute did not create vested contractual rights absent a clear statement of legislative intent to contract. There was no clear expression by the legislature that the Act was intended to create vested contractual rights in state employees prior to the satisfaction of all eligibility requirements.</SPAN></P>

Judgment for foreclosure by sale was rendered in each case in favor of the town. On appeal, the court found no error and remanded the cases. The court found that the questions included in the owners' statements of issues related to their motions for dismissal and the motions with requests for rulings. The court held that because owners did not object to the trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss and refusal to rule on the other motions, there was nothing from which to appeal. The court concluded that because the questions raised in the motions were the only issues stated in the reasons for appeal, there was nothing before the court for consideration.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error. The publicity did not concern the offenses for which defendant was on trial and did not approach the level where prejudice could be presumed. The trial court's extensive use of voir dire and the detailed instructions to the jurors were reasonably effective in protecting defendant's right to a fair trial. Defendant failed to demonstrate any specific prejudice to his defense arising from the trial court's denial of his motion for a continuance of one week. Defendant sought to question the victim, a foreign exchange student, about working while a student. The trial court's exclusion of this questioning was not error. The jury instructions that deviated from the requirements were those submitted by defendant and thus were not in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landlord sued defendants, employees of the city welfare department, alleging they had violated plaintiff's equal protection rights and the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act, Conn.

The court affirmed judgment in defendants' favor. First, plaintiff provided no basis for examining the equal protection claim on anything other than the rational basis test. Thus, although rent was sometimes paid directly to landlords, such payments were rare and the trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that plaintiff's requests for direct payment were treated no differently than the requests of other landlords, and there was no equal protection violation. Likewise, no violation of the Anti-Trust Act was shown as there was no evidence of a conspiracy by defendants that benefitted other landlords and harmed plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The crimes of sexual assault in the first degree, kidnapping in the first degree, larceny in the second degree, and robbery in the second degree resulted from an incident where a woman was abducted, raped, and robbed.

The court granted the motion of the State to transfer the case to the regular criminal docket pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-126. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal. The court held that since the prerequisite of imposition of sentence had not yet occurred, the transfer order in the case could not be deemed a final judgment. Strict adherence to the final judgment rule was necessary in criminal cases because the delays and disruptions attendant upon intermediate appeal were especially inimical to the effective and fair administration of the law. The court was not persuaded that the potential for harm to juvenile offenders from erroneous transfer orders was so much greater in kind or degree than that which a 17-year-old, improperly denied the benefits of youthful offender treatment, could suffer awaiting redress on appeal from a final judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court held that the trial court's finding that defendant could initially have misconstrued the victim's conduct as indicative of a willingness to engage in explicit sexual conduct did not prove that defendant was mistaken about the victim's consent or that he lacked the mental state necessary to commit the charged offenses. The evidence showed that, when the victim sought to withdraw from the situation, defendant was unwilling to permit her to do so and that he thereafter forced himself on the victim and compelled her to engage in sexual intercourse against her will. The court stated that the victim's unambiguous request to leave defendant's condominium removed from defendant any misinterpretation as to her wishes. Defendant's conduct was thereafter knowingly coercive. The court found that a temporary misunderstanding about consent did not give irreversible license to compel sexual intercourse. The court concluded that defendant's motion for a new trial was untimely and that allegedly new evidence could have been made available at trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted on a substitute information charging him with two counts of possession of cocaine and two counts of sale of cocaine. He was sentenced on each count to concurrent terms. On appeal, the court found no error. Defendant failed to object to the trial court's instructions on entrapment at trial. Because the instructions did not fail to submit to the jury an essential element of the offense or constitute plain error, defendant's claim was not preserved for review. The court employed a two-step analysis to examine the double jeopardy claim in the context of a single trial. First, the court found that each pair of possession and sale charges arose from a single act or transaction. Secondly, however, the court determined that a conviction for illegal possession of narcotics required proof of a fact that a conviction for illegal sale did not. Therefore, defendant was convicted of different offenses and therefore, the punishments that he received did not place him in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The UAPA adequately responded to the concerns about continued operation of the landfill pending an adjudication on the merits by the DEP. Because the landfill's complaint alleged a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the trial court correctly refused to grant the DEP's motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue in the case was whether the employee, who worked in the noncompetitive division of the classified service, had a right under the city charter or the state or federal constitutions to appeal a layoff for fiscal reasons to the city's civil service commission. The trial court found in favor of the employee, holding that Bridgeport, Conn., Charter &sect; 11 was unconstitutional because it treated noncompetitive and competitive employees differently by granting the competitive employees a hearing before discharge. Defendants appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the commission was without the statutory authority to sustain the employee's appeal. Absent any disparity in treatment of competitive and noncompetitive employees regarding appeals from layoffs for economic reasons under the city charter, the employee's equal protection claim could not stand.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court (Connecticut), which, after a jury trial, convicted defendant of three counts of murder and sentenced him to three terms of imprisonment of 25 years to life, such sentences to run consecutively, for a total effective sentence of 75 years to life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal the defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights; that the trial court erred in amending the indictment; that the composition of the grand jury and the conduct of its proceedings were improper; that the prosecutor's summation was prejudicial; and that the consecutive sentences were illegal. The court rejected the Fourth Amendment challenge, noting that the search warrant at issue and its supporting affidavit were legally sufficient, and that additional items not described in the warrant, but in plain view, were properly seized. The court also rejected the challenges to the grand jury composition and proceedings and to the court's amendment of the indictment. In addition, the court held that imposing multiple punishments for multiple crimes was not a double jeopardy violation and that defendant's sentence was legal. However, the court reversed the conviction, holding that the prosecutor's repeated references to defendant as a &quot;murderous fiend&quot; and a &quot;rat,&quot; combined with the court's refusal to instruct the jury to ignore the remarks constituted grounds for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmates appealed a judgment that was entered by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut). The judgment dismissed their petitions for a writ of habeas corpus, which they filed after appointed counsel from the public defender's office substantially delayed the processing of their respective appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties stipulated that the two to four and one-half year delays in processing the inmates' criminal appeals was caused by understaffing in the appellate public defender's office. The inmates contended that the delays violated their rights to due process, equal protection of the laws, and effective assistance of counsel contrary to Conn. Const., art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 10 and 20 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed the dismissal of the petitions. The court held that: (1) the trial court erred in dismissing the writs of all of the inmates except for two inmates whose cases were moot by virtue of the hearing of their appeals, and (2) in applying the federal speedy trial violation test in the context of institutionally engendered appellate delays, a court was obligated to balance the relevant factors so as to take into account the remedial alternatives that were available as well as the constitutional rights that were implicated. The court concluded that the inmates established that they have suffered extensive delays due to the understaffing of the public defender's office, and the delays discriminated against them because of their poverty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dismissal of the inmates' petitions for a writ of habeas corpus was reversed, except for the petitions of two inmates whose petitions were moot in light of the status of their criminal appeals. The matters were remanded to the trial court with direction to determine whether any of the inmates were prejudiced by the extended delay of their appeals, and to fashion an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant failed to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement because he did not prove that there was a substantial underrepresentation of Hispanics that affected the composition of the grand jury. The court applied the substantial impact test and determined that only slightly more than one additional Hispanic should have been included on every other grand jury. The court agreed that the instruction was erroneous because it undermined the jury's ability to remain impartial and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to provide the State with the opportunity to prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

He also contended that the court erred by denying his motion to suppress certain statements he made to a police officer and that the prosecutor improperly commented that he refused to talk to the police. The court held that (1) &sect; 53a-111 included situations where defendant burned a building with the intent to destroy it while he was aware that an accomplice was in or near the building; (2) defendant, who spoke to a police officer while medicated on morphine, waived his right against self-incrimination when he spoke to police because he was aware of the right and voluntarily relinquished it; and (3) the prosecutor's comments on defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent constituted reversible error because, in making the comments, the prosecutor implied that the jury should draw an unfavorable inference from defendant's decision to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted the state's petition and terminated the mother's parental rights. On appeal, the mother challenged the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-43a(a)(1) and (4), specifically challenging the district court's first and third grounds for termination. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that because the mother did not attack the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court's finding of failure to rehabilitate under Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-43a(a)(2) and never attacked the constitutional validity of that section, it was unnecessary to consider whether the remaining grounds were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Department of Liquor Control appealed the judgments from the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which sustained plaintiff distributor's appeal of a liquor license termination under 1981 Conn. Acts 81.367, and which declared the Act invalid in plaintiff licensee's suit against the Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act reduced a period for just cause terminations of liquor licenses from 24 months to 6 months. After the Department terminated their licenses, the distributor appealed the termination and the licensee sued the Department for a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional. When the superior court sustained the appeals and held the act invalid, the Department appealed. The cases were consolidated. The court reversed the judgment for the licensee and directed a judgment for the Department. The court reversed the judgment for the distributor and remanded. The court found error in both cases. The Act applied and was constitutional. The Act did not violate the Contracts Clause, or the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses. Although the Act applied prospectively to terminations of distributorships, the criteria for termination might have arisen either before or after its effective date. The Act applied to distributorships existing when it became effective. It was therefore reasonably foreseeable that a distributorship requirement for just cause termination would not have remained static and would have been reduced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the judgment for the distributor in its suit against the Department after the termination of its license and remanded for further proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of burglary in the third degree and criminal impersonation by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield, Geographical Area Number Two (Connecticut), from which he appealed. Defendant claimed the superior court erred: (1) in its instructions to the jury on the burglary charge; and (2) in its denial of defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal of criminal impersonation because of insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the burglary instruction. Taken as a whole and related to the facts, it was not reasonably possible that the instruction failed to guide the jury to a clear understanding of the offense. Given the careful relation of the evidence to the elements of the burglary charge, it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court's failure to read the statutory name and definition of larceny. As for the challenge to the criminal impersonation conviction, defendant alleged that giving a false name was not impersonation of another unless the name given was that of a real person. As no evidence proved the existence of a real Sam James, defendant argued his conviction could not stand. The plain meaning of &quot;another&quot; was an additional one of the same kind, one other than oneself. To impersonate another was to act as some other real person. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-130 had not prohibited giving a false name; it only prohibited impersonating another. Therefore, it was error to deny defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the criminal impersonation charge, as there was insufficient evidence for the jury to have found that he committed that crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was no error in defendant's conviction of the crime of burglary in the third degree. There was error in defendant's conviction of the crime of criminal impersonation, so that judgment of conviction was set aside. The case was remanded to the superior court with direction to render a judgment of acquittal on that charge.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix asserted that the trial court erred in barring her action unless she showed that: (1) a fee was charged or the actions were wilful or malicious; (2) the construction company was not a landowner; and (3) the complaint failed to allege malice. The court affirmed the decision that dismissed the individual and corporate landowner because the statute was proper in abrogating the common law by excepting certain acts from liability, but reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings the dismissal of the construction company since that company was not an owner of title to the land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that inadequate financing of the state judicial system had produced a backlog of civil jury cases in certain judicial districts. The trial court concluded that the question of whether the state's financing of the judicial system violated the litigants' constitutional rights because of delay in the disposition of their cases was nonjusticiable. The court affirmed, holding that although the courts had inherent authority to require the legislature to provide sufficient funding to operate the court system in accordance with constitutional requirements, such authority did not extend to requiring the appointment of additional judges. Increases in the number of judges, as well as appointments to the additional positions created, were not within the province of the judiciary. The exercise of such legislative power was forbidden to the judiciary under Conn. Const. art. II, the separation of powers provision. Accordingly, the case involved a nonjusticiable political question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff pedestrian appealed a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at New Britain (Connecticut), in which the jury found defendant city liable and awarded the pedestrian damages, which were limited by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2709 (1961), in a slip and fall case. The pedestrian contended that &sect; 2709 was unconstitutional as applied and violated equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pedestrian claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2709 violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection. The court agreed and held that &sect; 2709 violated equal protection principles and that it was therefore error to limit the damage award in the pedestrian's lawsuit. It was the city's duty to keep the sidewalk in good repair. The court explained that when the city's benefit of immunity began to burden a certain class of citizens, those persons injured on the city's sidewalks because of snow or ice accumulation, however, some identifiable reason for the city to receive that special benefit of immunity was required. The problem with &sect; 2709 was that the legislature, in enacting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-149, made a clear policy statement that municipal liability for damages caused by defective sidewalks was not to be limited. Given that clear pronouncement, there was no rational basis behind imposing a liability limit in damages for all such torts that happened to occur in the city. The court concluded that there was no reason why those injured by the city's tortious acts were denied full recovery of compensatory damages for resulting injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found error and set aside the judgment, and the case was remanded for a hearing in damages only. The statute that limited the city's liability to a certain amount was unconstitutional as applied and there was no reason why those injured by the city's tortious acts were denied full recovery of compensatory damages for resulting injuries.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then drove his car around the parking lot and returned to where decedent and his sister were standing. The car struck them both, thereby killing decedent and injuring his sister. Thereafter, defendant was charged with manslaughter and assault. Defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to introduce evidence of his voluntary intoxication to dispute that he had acted recklessly. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in excluding the evidence of voluntary intoxication because it would not have negated defendant's recklessness. The court also found that defendant was not deprived of the opportunity to contest recklessness. In addition, the court determined that the trial court properly instructed the jury concerning mental state and the drawing of inferences. Defendant's convictions were upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer sought a writ of mandamus to compel the town council to submit a proposed ordinance to the electors of the town. The proposed ordinance would have required that each budget be submitted to the electorate and be approved by a majority vote of the electors voting at referendum. The district court ultimately issued a writ of mandamus compelling the town council to submit the proposed ordinance by initiative petition to referendum. The court set aside the district court's judgment and ordered a new trial. Specifically, the court held that prior to issuing the writ of mandamus, the district court should have considered whether the taxpayer's proposed ordinance clearly exceeded the power of the electorate, as contended by the town council. The court found that whether the taxpayer had a &quot;clear legal right&quot; to mandamus depended upon whether the proposed ordinance clearly exceeded the legislative power of the electorate because it was forbidden to compel the town council to perform an act that was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. The court held that because the former insurer was named in the judgment, it was an aggrieved party and had standing to appeal. The court held that although the Workers' Compensation Act was an exclusive remedy for employees injured in the course of employment, it did not preclude the employee from seeking benefits under Conn.

The court rejected the claim because those two crimes were not mutually exclusive and thus the jury to convict had to all at least agree that defendant committed attempted robbery. Defendant claimed that evidence that was seized from his bedroom should have been suppressed. The search was reasonable, however, because defendant, a minor, lived in his parents' home, his father believed he had a right to enter his son's room, and both parents consented to the search. In addition, denial of a motion to suppress his confession was proper because defendant's refusal to answer specific questions did not require the police to cease all interrogation. The court also rejected the claim that the wrong insanity defense instruction was given and that this required defendant's conviction to be set aside. The court reasoned that the trial court gave a curative and proper jury instruction to which defense counsel did not take an exception to as inadequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual was found not guilty of a murder charge by reason of insanity and was committed to the hospital. In finding for the State, the trial court relied on Conn. Gen.

Defendants challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 17-317 on the ground that it arbitrarily and irrationally made those confined after an acquittal liable for hospital expenses while other persons similarly deprived of their liberty, such as prison inmates serving sentences, were not required to pay. The court agreed and declared &sect; 17-317, as well as Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-47(h), invalid as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Applying the &quot;rational basis&quot; standard, the court found that there existed no reasonable ground to support the distinction in regard to liability for hospital expenses that the legislature had chosen to make between insanity acquittees and prisoners convicted of crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the trial court's decision was an error and set aside the judgment in favor of the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court's affirmance of the trial court's judgment was based on a declaration that the different burdens of proof between Conn.

Stat. &sect; 17-178, which provided for civil commitment, violated equal protection of the law when it was taken into consideration that commitment via either statute gave rise to liability for hospitalization costs. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-47, clear and convincing evidence was required for civil commitment while pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-47 the State's had the burden to prove dangerousness for commitment only by a preponderance of the evidence. On a separate issue, the court ruled that it was capable of reaching the equal-protection issue in the case sub judice although the issue had not been raised in the trial court; this was because there was an exceptional circumstance in that the court had just announced a decision in a separate case that gave the executrix the new equal-protection right.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed an action alleging civil rights claims, seeking damages for the loss of salary and other benefits. The trial court dismissed the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court upheld the trial court's dismissal of the claims, which at could not be pursued due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but remanded to determine the constitutionality of the trustees' rules and the doctrine of constructive or implied resignation and to determine whether the union breached its duty of fair representation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-119(8) was not totally defective for not requiring any criminal intent for the offense of larceny by receiving stolen property. The court also found that the phrase, &quot;receiving stolen property knowing that it was probably stolen,&quot; fulfilled the requirement of guilty knowledge and that the word &quot;probably&quot; did not lessen the State's burden to prove knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. The court determined that the jury charge properly placed the burden on the State to prove all of the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and did not confuse the jury on the issue of possession. Because there was evidence from which the jury could have found that defendant retained stolen property valued over $ 2,000, the court concluded that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landlord appealed a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which dismissed the landlord's action against defendants, the Commissioner of Income Maintenance and a former tenant who was a welfare recipient. The landlord claimed the Commissioner wantonly and wilfully refused to pay the tenant's rent directly to the landlord.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant, a welfare recipient, owed the landlord rent. The landlord claimed that the law obligated the Commissioner to make direct payments of the tenant's rent to the landlord. The landlord brought an action against the Commissioner and the tenant for damages. The trial court dismissed the tenant from the case because she had not been served, found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-82k was constitutional and prohibited the direct rent payments, and determined that the Commissioner did not purposely and intentionally discriminate against the landlord in violation of &sect; 1983. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's conclusion was not clearly erroneous. The court agreed with the Commissioner's claim that the landlord could not prevail because he failed to comply with Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 390(d). Welfare recipients who were tenants and perhaps landlords had a legitimate interest in the outcome of the case and they were entitled to notice. Because all persons having an interest in the complaint were not made parties or given reasonable notice of the action, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the landlord's constitutional challenge or &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the trial court's judgment that dismissed the landlord's claim against the Commissioner for wantonly and wilfully refusing to pay the landlord his tenant's rent. The court found the trial court erred by ruling on the merits of the landlord's constitutional and &sect; 1983 claims. The court set aside those judgments and remanded with direction to dismiss the claims for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Applicant two filed a counterclaim seeking appointment. The trial court ordered that applicant two be placed first on the list, holding that applicant one was not qualified to take the examination and that he was foreclosed from attacking the constitutionality of the residency rule. The court remanded, holding that the record was deficient. On remand, the trial court held that the residency requirement unconstitutionally implicated applicant one's right to travel and that there was no compelling governmental interest to justify the law. On appeal, the court found no error. The right to travel, even within a single state, was a protected fundamental right.

The court affirmed the trial court's findings, holding that the trial court did not err in failing to require DCYS to provide supportive services in an attempt to reunite the family because there was sufficient evidence that the child could not be safely returned to his parents, that the trial court did submit the study before any dispositional decision was made.

The appellate court reversed and the court affirmed finding that rules committee did not fall within the purview of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-18a(a). Essentially, the citizen claimed that the rules committee was a &quot;public agency&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 1.18a(a). The court rejected this argument finding that the played no role in the management of the internal institutional machinery of the court system. It was charged with the responsibility of formulating rules of practice and procedure that directly control the conduct of litigation. Accordingly, the court held that the rules committee did not perform &quot;administrative functions&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 1-18a (a) and was therefore not subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff low-income tenants filed a class action against defendant state housing authorities for permanent injunctive relief under the Connecticut Uniform Relocation Assistance Act (URAA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-266 through 8-282. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut) granted the injunction. The state housing authorities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The low-income tenants were forced to move from their apartments when the state housing authorities condemned the buildings in which they lived pursuant to a city housing code. The URAA established a policy of fair treatment of persons displaced by state and local programs of code enforcement and voluntary rehabilitation of buildings. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-266 of the URAA. Displaced person meant a person who moved because of a code enforcement activity or program of rehabilitation pursuant to the governmental supervision. Conn. Gen. Stat. 8-267(3) of the URAA. Because the generic term, building code, in the URAA included all codes dealing with building safety and health requirements, the city housing code used by state housing authorities that caused the low-income tenants to move constituted a code enforcement program, and therefore the low-income tenants were displaced persons within the URAA. The URAA did not violate Conn. Const. art I, &sect; 1, because the URAA served a public purpose and there was a rational relationship to the different classification of the low-income tenants as those deserving of assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the state housing authorities' appeal of a contempt order because it ultimately complied with the order, and no sanctions were imposed. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the low-income tenants but remanded the granting of injunctive relief so that it could be clarified so as not to require the state housing authorities to engage in a building program and to give it time to provide necessary rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the superior court's grant of the developers' motion to reduce the amount of the prejudgment attachment and found that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the developers' expert to testify as to the condition of the condominiums and the estimated cost of repairing them. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278l, the owners did not have a right to appeal the denial of their motion to modify their own previously obtained ex parte prejudgment remedy. Moreover, the superior court's pretrial determination that the owners were unlikely to meet the enhanced burden of proof on their fraud claim was not clearly erroneous, and so the pro tanto reduction in the prejudgment remedy was justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut), which in a consolidated trial convicted defendant of risk of injury pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 and sexual assault in the fourth degree pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-73a(a)(1)(A). The trial court denied defendant's motion for reargument. The trial court granted defendant's motion for consolidation of the appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges in the case stemmed from separate incidents involving defendant's sexual contact with two females under the age of 16. In the first case, the court determined that defendant's &quot;touching&quot; of the breast was an act directly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to her moral well being. Defendant's claim that he had no fair warning that breast fondling was a prohibited act was without merit. Equally without merit was defendant's claim that he had been charged twice for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy prohibition. Because sexual assault in the fourth degree and risk of injury each required proof of an element not required by the other, defendant's claim failed. Accordingly, no error was found in the first case. In the second case, the trial court committed error in denying defendant's request at trial for a jury instruction on consent. At the new trial, if the jury determined that consent was given, the trial court was instructed to dismiss the risk of injury charges since Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 would then not be violated as applied to the particular facts of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court in the first case. The court found an error in the second case, and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The fire marshal challenged the constitutionality of the statutory preference for members of a local fire department in the selection of a local fire marshal on the grounds that it created a privileged class in violation of Conn.

The court disagreed and held that an act served a public purpose under art. 1, &sect; 1 when it promoted the welfare of the State, or when the principal reason for the appropriation was to benefit the public. Counsel for the fire marshal conceded that the enhancement of morale in the local fire departments was a legitimate public purpose to be served by legislation, and that promotion of a fire marshal from within the local department was a rational method of enhancing morale. The court held that absent a particularized showing that any preference applied in this case would be irrational, the fire marshal failed to meet his heavy burden of proving Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorneys launched an advertisement campaign involving commercials that were broadcast by an area television station. The grievance committee alleged that Conn. Rules of Prof. Conduct 2-101 prohibited legal advertising on television and that the advertisements were false and misleading. The attorneys claimed that the advertisements were protected speech. Finding that the attorneys did not violate the rule, the court set aside the judgment reprimanding the attorneys. The state could impose some restrictions on legal advertising but could not impose a blanket suppression of that speech. Because the rule did not address electronic advertising, it was ambiguous. The court found that the rule did not intend a blanket prohibition on advertising through electronic media. In order to satisfy constitutional standards, the rule had to be reasonably designed to prohibit only those statements that threatened a legitimate interest. Restriction of legal advertising to those who read published materials would deny nonreaders important information with no corresponding benefit to them or any other segment of society.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The principle issue on appeal was the validity of defendant's identification. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the victim's photographic and in-court identifications of defendant over his objection that the photographic array was unnecessarily suggestive and that the identifications were unreliable because the victim testified that she had not previously seen the photograph, defendant failed to meet his threshold burden of proving the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and the State was not required to conduct additional corroborative identification procedures. The court also held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for a mistrial so that his attorney could testify as a witness to impeach the credibility of defendant's girlfriend because the cross-examination of the girlfriend and the testimony of an investigator elicited substantially the same impeachment as the proffered attorney's testimony and because defendant failed to articulate that the denial of his motion deprived him of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The second evaluator agreed with defendant's defense. The trial court ordered a third evaluation mid-trial because the first evaluator could not be called in rebuttal due to illness. Defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that the third evaluation was error.

When considering the State's interest in an orderly trial process, as well as the potential for the jurors to place undo emphasis on the evidence, if admitted, the trial court did not violate defendant's due process rights by denying his motion to reopen the case after it was submitted to the jury. Finally, the court found that while the trial court's jury charge did not follow the specific language of defendant's request, it was correct in law, it adapted to the issues, and it was sufficient for the guidance of the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent housing authority appealed a decision of the Superior Court, the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), which entered a judgment granting petitioner gas company's request for the appointment of a receiver of rents, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-262f. The company appealed the superior court's second judgment, granting the authority's motion to vacate the previous judgment and to dismiss the gas company's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the company was precluded from terminating service to residential dwellings, under &sect; 16-262e, it was entitled to summarily seek a receiver of rents. The superior court found an outstanding indebtedness and, therefore, appointed a receiver for the rental income of the authority. While that was on appeal, the authority paid under protest the amount allegedly due to the receiver, although the appointment of the receiver was stayed pending the appeal. The superior court then terminated the receivership. The court held that: (1) the summary rent receivership proceedings did not require the filing of a companion civil action; (2) the authority's claim of immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-65 made no provision for immunity for public housing authorities as to statutory liens, including rent receiverships, and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-626f made no distinction between public and private ownership; (3) the legislature could constitutionally provide for a summary receivership proceeding; and (4) the receivership should not have been terminated because there were outstanding issues as to proper allocation of the moneys collected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the superior court's judgment appointing a receiver of rents. The court found error in the judgment that vacated the prior judgment and dismissed the gas company's petition. The court ordered a new trial for the resolution of various points of contention between the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employer appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Hartford-New Britain (Connecticut) that denied its application to vacate an arbitration award in favor of defendant employee and granted the employee's cross-application to confirm the arbitration award. The employee had brought an underlying administrative claim that alleged he was wrongfully discharged in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;53-303e.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee alleged that he could not observe his Sabbath because the employer required managers to work one Sunday per month. The employer claimed the arbitrators exceeded their power by finding in violation of &sect; 53-303e because the employee resigned and that &sect; 53-303e was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 53-303e violated the Establishment clause. The parties freely submitted the disputed applicability of the statute's &quot;discharge&quot; language, and all other issues on the validity of the employee's claim under &sect; 53-303e, to arbitration. The award conformed to this unrestricted submission and was therefore binding. Nonetheless, &sect; 53-303e did not satisfy the three-part establishment clause test. Section 53-303e did not have a &quot;clear secular purpose&quot; because the term &quot;Sabbath&quot; used in &sect; 53-303e(b) was not synonymous with a &quot;day of rest.&quot; Subsection (b) conferred its &quot;benefit&quot; on an explicitly religious basis and had the primary effect of advancing religion. The authority granted to the board by &sect; 53-303e(c) to resolve disputes arising under &sect; 53-303e(b) violated the third part of the establishment clause analysis forbidding excessive governmental entanglements with religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that denied the employer's application to vacate the arbitration award in favor of the employee was set aside because the statute under which the employer was charged violated the Establishment Clause. The matter was remanded to permit a judgment granting the employer's application to vacate to be entered.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 19a-24 had to be very narrowly done. The court found that the statute expressly excepted the Commissioner from the application of sovereign immunity in civil actions.

The trial court held that plaintiff's actions were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff building owner built a new manufacturing facility and contracted with defendant roofing installer to build the roof of the structure with materials manufactured by defendant roofing material manufacturer. The roof failed and plaintiff brought a products liability action against defendant roofing material manufacturer and a breach of contract action against defendant roofing installer. The trial court directed verdicts on plaintiff's claims in favor of defendants, based on statutes of limitations. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the injury inflicted in the case was inflicted when the roof was completed. The court held that the contract between plaintiffs and defendant roofing installer was for the performing of a specific, definable act, i.e., the construction of a roof. At that time neither defendant had any continuing, indivisible responsibility for the attainment of an end result. Plaintiff's claim that the statute was tolled by the conduct of defendants in fraudulently concealing the fact that plaintiffs had a potential cause of action against them was without merit because the claim had not been specifically pled in response to the defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The directed verdicts granted in favor of defendant roofing installer and defendant roofing material manufacturer were affirmed. Because the nature of the contract between plaintiff and defendant roofing installer was for a specific act without further provisions, the statutes of limitations for the products liability claim and for the breach of contract claim began on the date that the roofing construction was completed.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal dismissed both parties' appeals based on its determination that (1) the Commission was not an aggrieved party and was thus ineligible to pursue its appeal because it did not have a specific personal and legal interest in the matter and had not been injuriously affected by the court's decision; and (2) the Commissioner was not disqualified pursuant to &sect; 1-21j-7 to sit and vote as a Commission member on the final order even though he had conducted the initial hearing on the issue.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner began an investigation into the law clinic's fee practices and its advertising under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. The commissioner claimed that the law clinic deceived consumers because it was essentially a front for a law firm. Consumers would seek legal help from the law clinic and then would be referred to the law firm. The commissioner issued an investigative demand on the law clinic. The attorneys refused to comply with the demand, so the commissioner initiated an action that sought to compel compliance. The trial court dismissed the commissioner's application finding that the regulation of attorney conduct was exclusively within the control of the judicial branch. On appeal, the court found that the Act authorized the commissioner's investigation of the law clinic and its attorneys. The court reasoned that the state rules governing attorneys' professional conduct and the Act could coexist. The Act was a statute of general applicability and could overlap with the state rules regarding attorney conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union commenced a strike against the employer. The employer filed an action seeking, among other things, a temporary injunction and alleging that the union was engaged in unlawful conduct.

The trial court was not clearly erroneous in determining that unlawful acts had been committed and that the union actually participated in or authorized the picketing. The conduct of the picket line could not be considered peaceful, and there was no adequate remedy at law because only the issuance of an injunction could prevent the continuing injury. The employer satisfied its burden under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 31-114, 31-115, and the trial court was within its discretion in issuing the injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield at Bridgeport (Connecticut), which denied his motion to open a prior judgment of conviction for second degree kidnapping, first degree sexual assault, and third degree robbery. The trial court had accepted his guilty plea and after a hearing on whether defendant qualified for psychiatric treatment based on an examination, he was sentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An examination concluded that defendant did not meet the statutory criteria for commitment and the trial court denied his request for a continuance for a hearing on the issue. He appealed his sentence and moved the trial court to open the judgment based on violations of his due process rights. That motion was denied. On review, he questioned the report's failure to recommend probation and whether the failure of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-245(b) to mandate a full hearing was a capricious classification, making it unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court did not err in its refusal to grant a continuance for a hearing on the report because no constitutional basis was advanced and there was no statutory requirement that such hearing be held. The sentence imposed was not illegal. Therefore, the trial court's authority to open the judgment was limited by the application of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. 934. As a result, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-244 and 17-245 did not create a liberty interest. Lastly, the considerations involved when a defendant was not going to be confined were totally different and justified the omission of holding any hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that he had been convicted of rioting on the basis of an uncharged statutory theory of criminal liability based on the wording of the statute, which he contended set forth nine theories of criminal liability. The use of nine verbs, in what defendant called the &quot;moving or proscriptive clause&quot; of the statute with the word &quot;or&quot; before &quot;takes part in,&quot; showed with &quot;substantial certainty&quot; that the legislature intended the parts of the statute to be separate and not cumulative. The jury convicted defendant of rioting and acquitted him of assault. The court affirmed. Although nine separate verbs were used, their common meanings and their association with each other caused them to fall into two groups: those that covered the leaders or planners and those who followed them in the proscribed occurrence, whether it was organized or spontaneous.

The court disagreed, noting that, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-14, the issue of valuation was to be determined by the trial court. The trial court employed the income method of valuation, the approach primarily relied upon by all of the appraisers, including the debtors' witness. In determining valuation, the trial court accepted and rejected portions of each appraiser's testimony in an effort to reach a compromise between the conflicting evidence presented. Further, the trial court's valuation efforts were muddied because the sale was at a price inflated by atypical financing arrangements. Although a recent sale resulting from fair negotiations between a desirous buyer and a willing seller, neither under any undue compulsion to make a deal, would ordinarily be the most reliable indicator of fair market value, the extremely favorable financing obtained by the buyer and his limited liability combined to warrant the conclusion that the price did not fully reflect the consideration exchanged in the transaction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the ex-husband's motion for partition in accordance with the parties' stipulation. The home was sold at public auction to the ex-wife. The trial court entered a supplemental judgment ordering distribution of the sale proceeds. On appeal, the court found no error. There was no error in the entry of the judgment authorizing the sale of the property because the ex-wife's attorney stipulated to such authorization and the ex-wife was bound by the acts of her attorney. The ex-husband was not barred from reacquiring an interest in the home by virtue of language in the quitclaim deed whereby the ex-wife originally received the property; the deed language barring the ex-husband from claiming any right or title in the premises did not act as a bar to the future acquisition of an interest in the property from the decree incident to the parties' divorce action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Some limited partners brought an action against a partner and corporation in which they accused them of fraudulent misrepresentation and conveyance of real property.

The court refused to discharge the notice of lis pendens. Although the partner and corporation asserted that &sect; 52-325 was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the court disagreed. The court reached this decision by weighing the interests affected by lis pendens, the risks of erroneous deprivation, and the governmental interests involved. Further, the court found that the trial court correctly issued lis pendens after deciding that there was probable cause that the limited partners would prevail in court. There was sufficient evidence to justify a finding of probable cause and that standard had been an appropriate one, the court noted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the mother of five children, appealed from an order of the Superior Court for juvenile matters in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), which granted temporary custody of the children to plaintiff, the Commissioner of the Department of Children and Youth Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's youngest child died suddenly. No cause of death could be determined at that time, but a pediatrician noticed some unexplained superficial marks on the child's body. As a result, the commissioner seized custody of the five remaining children. The juvenile court later found &quot;probable cause&quot; and, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-129(b), ordered temporary custody of the children to remain with the commissioner. On appeal, the court remanded the case. The court held that &sect; 46b-129(b) was constitutional because, when it was read together with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-38a, as it had to be, it was justified by a compelling state interest and was narrowly drawn to express only that legitimate state interest. The court also held, however, that the juvenile court erred when it decided that &quot;probable cause&quot; was the standard of proof in a temporary custody proceeding. The standard of proof to be used in temporary custody hearings under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-129(b)(2) was the normal civil standard of a fair preponderance of the evidence. The court further held that the burden of proof was always on the state when it sought to remove children from the home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case to the juvenile court with direction to set aside the orders of temporary custody.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, however, failed to show that he was harmed by that abuse of discretion. Therefore, although the trial court's action was wrong, it did not constitute reversible error. The trial court correctly granted the State's motion to quash the subpoenas. The court rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury by instructing them that they should consider defendant's interest in the outcome of the case when weighing his credibility as a witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a residential village was developed a portion of the road in question was purposely left undeveloped.

The court noted that both before and after its discontinuance, the road was not only unimproved but also impassable by vehicle. Contrary to appellees' contention, the court held that Conn. Gen.

The court stated that both before and after the discontinuance of the road, appellees had an unabated right to use that roadbed in its unimproved condition, or with whatever improvements they found it profitable to make, to get to and from their unimproved land. The court stated that the physical rights to traverse the road were unaffected by its discontinuance.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19-480a(b), 19-481(c) and 19-453(a). Defendant moved to suppress the use as evidence of marihuana and other material seized pursuant to a search warrant. As grounds for suppression defendant alleged that the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant did not establish probable cause on which the warrant properly could issue. The trial court granted the defendant's motion to suppress and granted the motion to dismiss the charges against defendant. On appeal, the state claimed that it was error to suppress the evidence seized under the challenged warrant because the supporting affidavit contained sufficient information to establish probable cause. The court agreed and vacated the lower court's judgment. The court held that the context of the whole affidavit established probable cause to believe that marihuana was contained within the boxes for which the warrant was issued.</SPAN></P>

The court trial pointed out that the pleadings were not sufficient to support a judgment, that the employee had not followed the rules, and that the case would be dismissed if the employee did not take steps to change the situation. On appeal, the court held that while pro se litigants were given more leniency in the formalities of pleading and practice, the employee was still bound to follow the applicable court rules. The court declined to consider a claim that stated that the trial court action was unconstitutional under the first and fourteenth amendments, because the employee never briefed the issue in any way. The court held that in view of the employee's repeated failure to comply with the trial court's order to revise his complaint, the court could only conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the employer's motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant insurance commissioner appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which sustained plaintiff insurers' appeals from the commissioner's action imposing restrictions upon the renewal of the insurers' licenses to do business in Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner restricted the insurers' licenses by limiting their activities to the renewal of insurance policies previously issued to Connecticut residents and to other policyholders who might later come to reside in Connecticut. The insurers argued that the commissioner had no just cause to impose the restriction under the authority of the licensing statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38-20, and made several claims of unconstitutionality. The trial court sustained the insurers' appeals on the ground that the commissioner's policy of compelling insurance companies to serve all residents of the state could be implemented only by issuance of an appropriate regulation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-168. Dismissing the appeal, the court held that nothing in the record suggested that the judgments had any effect but to vitiate the limitations on the licenses during their effective period; therefore, as the licenses expired before the court heard the case, the trial court's order had no further effect and presented no barrier to a declaration of mootness.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the action, the parties executed a stipulated agreement whereby the wife agreed not to seek alimony in exchange for custody of their child and child support payments.

Upon granting the dissolution, the trial court awarded the wife alimony, pursuant to Conn. Gen.

The husband appealed the award of alimony, contending that the stipulated agreement precluded the award. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined the agreement to be inequitable to the wife under Conn. Gen.

The voters appealed, and the court noted that they claimed essentially that the principle required the general assembly to adopt the number of districts of the house of representatives which most effectively minimized the cutting of town lines. The court found the voters' claim to be incorrect because it was based on a lack of understanding that the federal one-person, one-vote principle mandated equality of population to the extent practicable. The general assembly was not required by the town integrity principle to adopt a particular number of districts for the house. The court also noted that the problem with the voters' reliance on the existence of a better plan to demonstrate the invalidity of the adopted plan was that the purported demonstration depended upon the incorrect assumption that a plan was unconstitutional if there was a better plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which dismissed his request for habeas corpus relief. Petitioner claimed that the conditions in the segregation unit at the correctional institution in which he was incarcerated constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that the totality of the conditions and procedures was so counter-rehabilitative and oppressive as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. His specific claims were: (1) insufficient outside recreation, (2) insufficient showers per week, (3) consumption of meals in same cell where other bodily functions are performed, and (4) inadequate access to the institution's library. On appeal, the court held that did not consider the fourth specification, because although it involved fundamental constitutional rights, it did not implicate the Eighth Amendment. With respect to the remaining Eighth Amendment claims, the evidence did not support the conclusion that the specified conditions, whether viewed individually or in combination, added up to cruel and unusual punishment. Petitioner failed to establish that his health was jeopardized or adversely impacted, that there was insufficient hygiene or indifference to his basic hygienic needs, or that the food served was deficient in quantity, quality or nutrition. Petitioner's claim that the totality of conditions in the segregation unit offended the Eighth Amendment founds no support in the record and therefore had to fail.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that his conviction as a persistent felony offender was vitiated because the previous felony relied upon was a violation of Conn. Gen.

The court held that: (1) the exclusion of evidence regarding the witnesses' prior misconduct did not deprive defendant of any constitutional rights; (2) under Conn. Gen.

The trial court denied the intervention motion. The Towns sought review and argued that they had a right to intervene under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 99.

In response, defendant challenged justiciability, appealability, and the State's standing. The court affirmed the resentencing order, holding that the judicial department could vacate its judgment without violating the separation of powers provisions of the constitution. The trial court lacked any appellate authority to review actions of the sentence review division. Justiciability criteria were satisfied, the state's attorney general had a personal interest in criminal controversy on behalf of the State, and that the issue of the Act's constitutionality was appealable as it was raised before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the trial court did not impose penalties for days on which the individual teachers could not purge themselves of contempt.

The court held that any error in the jury instructions did not warrant reversal. In instructing the jury on the elements of robbery, the trial court improperly failed to explain that the deprivation or appropriation intended must be permanent. However, defendant did not object to the omission, and the issue was not in dispute. The issue before the jury was whether the taking was wrongful; that the retention was permanent and intended to be so was undisputed, as evidenced by defendant's testimony that he told someone that he was going to keep the drugs and that he used half of the heroin that was taken. There was no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the trial court's charge. Defendant also claimed that the jury charge improperly referred to his interest in the outcome of the trial, but the court declined to consider the claim because defendant failed to object and similar constitutional challenges were rejected in the past.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his murder conviction from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield at Bridgeport (Connecticut). Defendant claimed error in: (1) the denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel; (2) the decision of the trial court not to admit evidence concerning one of the deceased's convictions; and (3) the instructions to the jury on intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant fired a single gunshot at the victim, which resulted in his death. The incident arose from a dispute concerning the right to run an outdoor dice game. Defendant did not deny the shooting, but he maintained that he had fired in self-defense and only with the intent to incapacitate. The court found no error and affirmed defendant's conviction. Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, the court held that the record on appeal was inadequate to allow the court to decide whether the performance of trial counsel was neither reasonably competent, nor within the range of competence exercised by attorneys with ordinary training and skill in criminal law. Second, defendant assigned error to the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce evidence concerning the victim's conviction for the unlawful discharge of a firearm. The court found that the exclusion of evidence concerning the conviction was harmless. Inclusion would have been cumulative. Finally, regarding the trial court's instructions on intent, the court held that the charge cured the otherwise ambiguous use of the word &quot;presume,&quot; as it involved inference and presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in defendant's murder conviction and affirmed it. As for defendant's challenge to the trial court's definition of &quot;intent,&quot; the court held that the trial court's instructions on intent were adequate to explain the meaning of &quot;intent&quot; to the jury. Although it would have been preferable for the trial court to have read the statutory definition to the jury, it made clear that &quot;intent&quot; was synonymous with &quot;purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court found that defendant did not have a constitutional right to record or transcribe the grand jury proceedings, and thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to transcribe the proceeding. In addition, the court held that the trial court did not err in charging the jury that &quot;every person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts.&quot; The trial court adequately clarified the use of the word &quot;presumed&quot; to preclude any misunderstanding on the part of the jury. Finally, defendant was not prejudiced by the State's tardy delivery of certain exculpatory material requested by defendant prior to trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The detainee was indicted in New Jersey for conspiracy to obtain, possess, and distribute a vast quantity of marijuana. The governor of New Jersey made an extradition request to the governor of Connecticut, who issued an extradition warrant for the return of the detainee under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-162. The trial court dismissed the detainee's application for a writ of habeas corpus and the court found no error. Although the detainee was extradited as a non-fugitive, the fact that the requisition papers inaccurately referred to him as a fugitive did not warrant his release because the requesting papers were deemed sufficient by Connecticut. The court found that the requesting papers were sufficient to charge the detainee with a crime under New Jersey law. The indictment adequately described the detainee's participation in a conspiracy to purchase and transport marijuana by his meeting with co-conspirators to plan the transport of the drugs and by his driving of the co-conspirators to the airport. Although the detainee did not participate in the final portion of the conspiracy, he was involved in agreement to violate the laws of New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, father and son, filed suit against defendants, company and restaurant, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut), as permitted by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-216a, reduced the jury award in favor of the father and son by the amount that they had received in settlement with other alleged tortfeasors. The father and son sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 52-216a authorized the trial court to deduct from a jury verdict the amount of money a party had received in settlement from other parties. The father and son argued that &sect; 52-216a was unconstitutional because it did not provide any guidance to the court in giving it authority to reduce a jury verdict. The corporation and restaurant argued that it was unconstitutional because it denied them their right to a jury trial. The court found that &sect; 52-216a gave the trial court authority to reduce an award in its discretion and that this limitation, in conjunction with case law that permitted a reduction in the verdict when the verdict and the settlement amount combined was excessive, provided a standard sufficient to satisfy procedural due process. The court found, however, that &sect; 52-216a permitted the trial court to arbitrarily substitute its judgment for that of the jury and, as a result, denied the parties their constitutional right to have the extent of the damages decided by a jury. Because the unconstitutional portion of &sect; 52-216a could not be severed from the remaining portions of that section, the court held that &sect; 52-216a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set the judgment aside and remanded the case for a hearing regarding damages.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's instructions on intent included a statement that every person was presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act. In his challenge to the instruction, defendant relied upon on a decision of the United States Supreme Court, which found a similar instruction was invalid because it violated due process rights in that a reasonable jury could interpret the instruction as a burden shifting presumption. The court pointed out that the use of the word &quot;presume&quot; did not itself render an instruction invalid. It was the lack of qualifying instructions as to the legal effect of the presumption, that made it possible for a reasonable jury to interpret the use of the word &quot;presume&quot; in an unconstitutional manner.

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's conviction of defendant for risk of injury to a child, concluding that an officer was constitutionally permitted to accompany defendant to another part of his apartment to forestall his access to weapons or to prevent his escape. That was so because defendant was under arrest and he voluntarily went into the other room. Similarly, there was no error in the lower court's refusal to charge the jury on fourth degree sexual assault because that was not a lesser-included offense of risk of injury to a child. The lesser offense required proof of an element that the greater did not. Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to the requested instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner failed to raise the issue of improper jury instructions on direct appeal but initiated it in his habeas corpus action subsequent to the conclusion of his direct appeal. The court, however, agreed with the trial court's conclusion that petitioner's failure to raise the issue on appeal did not constitute a deliberate bypass of the appellate process. The petitioner claimed that the instructions given to the jury constituted error entitling him to a new trial. The commissioner argued that the challenged instructions contained other language that was sufficiently precise or elaborate to prevent the jury from applying the instructions in an unconstitutional manner. The court granted the writ of habeas corpus and set aside the petitioner's convictions, holding that the instructions on intent in all three counts were invalid because the language expressly used in the challenged and erroneously conclusive and presumptive instructions on the first count was incorporated by reference in the instructions on the other two counts and was repeated to the jury in response to a question regarding intent after deliberation had begun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner appealed from zoning authorities' decisions. The property owner appealed a decision of the zoning commission that found the use of his property as a commercial boatyard violated a zoning ordinance.

The zoning board of appeals denied his appeal and affirmed the decision of the zoning enforcement officer and of the commission. Both appeals were presented at the same time for determination by the trial court, which consolidated them. The trial court sustained the first appeal and determined that the second appeal was moot. Defendants appealed and the court held that the language in Noank fire district, Conn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 13.7 rendered it unconstitutional because of its failure to meet the constitutional mandate that a regulation be as reasonably precise as the subject matter requires and as reasonably adequate and sufficient to guide the commission and to enable those affected to know their rights and obligations.

After defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree and robbery in the first degree, he appealed. The court reversed and set aside the convictions for a new trial. The totality of the circumstances did not support the reliability of the victim's station house identification of defendant as her assailant. The circumstances did not reveal a need for a one man show-up with its attendant suggestiveness. There was no danger that the opportunity for an identification would have been lost unless a speedy show-up was held. The show-up was therefore unnecessarily suggestive. The corrupting effect of the suggestive procedure outweighed the factors favoring finding the identification reliable. The admission of the identification violated defendant's constitutional rights to due process. Sound judicial policy required reversal whenever the erroneous admission of an unnecessarily suggestive and unreliable identification violated constitutional rights. The tainted evidence included all the identifications of defendant by the only eyewitness to the crime, the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in connection with the sexual assault of a female victim and his act of throwing her over a bridge railing. The trial court gave the jurors a general instruction stating that a person's intention may be inferred from his conduct and every person was &quot;conclusively presumed&quot; to intend the natural and necessary consequences of his act. The court affirmed the judgment in part and set aside the judgment in part, and a new trial was ordered. The court held that the trial court's instructions to the jury in regard to the offenses of attempted murder and robbery were invalid because they contained an express conclusive presumption. Such a presumption denied an accused of a fair trial by failing to delineate the State's burden of proof on the element of intent and by directing the jury to find against him on that element. The trial court's specific instructions for the offenses of kidnapping and sexual assault did not incorporate and cured the invalid general instruction. Further, the trial court's action of having defendant removed from the courtroom due to disruptive behavior did not deny his right of self-representation under Conn. Const. art.

Good faith disagreements about what constituted disability did not demonstrate a manifest abuse of prosecutorial discretion. The trial court properly decided defendant motion to dismiss regarding his speedy trial rights, which was an appealable order.

The commission denied his application. The developer appealed the decision to the trial court pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8. The trial court sustained the appeal and ordered affirmative relief for the developer. On appeal, the commission claimed that the trial court erred in permitting an attack on the Westport zoning regulations per se in the course of an appeal from the commission's denial of the developer's site plan application. It also contended that there was error in finding unconstitutionally vague the Westport zoning regulations affecting site plan review. The court ordered the judgment set aside and the case remanded to the trial court. The court held that a party who had sought to avail himself of a zoning ordinance by making an application thereunder was precluded in the same proceeding from raising the question of its constitutionality. However, he could attack the constitutionality of the zoning regulations in an independent proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant corrections commissioner sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which granted petitioner prisoner's habeas corpus petition and ordered the calculation of his statutory good time credits under the law in effect at the time of his resentencing, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-7a, rather than that at the time of his first sentencing, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was originally sentenced on July 19, 1974, for rape. On appeal, his conviction was set aside and the case was remanded for new trial. Thereafter, the prisoner pled guilty to the same offense, and was, on April 12, 1977, resentenced. The commissioner calculated the prisoner's sentence as if it had commenced July 19, 1974. On appeal, the commissioner argued that the opening words of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-38(c) require that, for all purposes, and not just in relation to time-served credits, a resentence shall be calculated as if it had commenced at the time the vacated sentence was commenced. The trial court refused to accord so expansive a reading to &sect; 53a-38, and upon review, the court agreed with the trial court's interpretation. The determination of statutory good time credits depended upon the date of the prisoner's valid sentence in relation to the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-7, 18-7a. The operative date for the prisoner's sentence, under &sect;&sect; 18-7, 18-7a, was April 12, 1977. The prisoner was therefore entitled to good time credits according to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-7a.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the teacher was entitled to a hearing under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution before he was terminated and that sovereign immunity did not apply because the teacher had raised a constitutional issue. It was proper for the trial court to grant prospective injunctive relief because the trial court avoided undue interference with governmental functions. The teacher was tenured based on the board's personnel policies and the teacher's seven years of service. The trial court's conclusion that the teacher's years of service at another community college counted toward his tenure was not clearly erroneous because the board pointed to no evidence to show otherwise. Because the teacher was tenured, the board's dismissal procedures applied, and the board did not argue that it had cause for the dismissal.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the right to a furlough, granted by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-101a, was a matter of legislative grace rather than a fundamental right, which required rational basis review. The decision of the legislature to treat a failure to return from furlough as an escape had a rational basis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction of murder. The court held that the evidence in the prosecution for murder, following the shooting of a victim by defendant with a shotgun, supported the finding that defendant did not &quot;like&quot; the victim, that defendant deliberately obtained shells and loaded the shot gun, and that defendant deliberately shot the victim. Thus, defendant's conviction was sustained; the record in the prosecution for murder showed that defendant was neither subjected to verbal questioning by police officers prior to the giving of the Miranda warnings, nor to conduct by the officers designed to elicit incriminating utterances from defendant. Thus, defendant's statements were not inadmissible merely because they were uttered prior to the time he was given the Miranda warnings; and the instruction, which included a charge to the effect that the jury pay proper respect to each other's opinions, adequately apprised the jurors of their individual responsibility both to reconsider their opinion, and to reach his or her own conclusion, and not merely to acquiesce to the conclusion of others.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the assaults, defendant was confined, and the assaults were committed on two youth-service officers. Defendant contended that the conditions and circumstances of his confinement were a defense. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-14 provided the defense of duress. The defense of necessity was not codified. These defenses were not available where there was a reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law: a chance both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm. The court ruled that these defenses did not apply here. There was no indication that defendant had ever made an attempt to use administrative or judicial means to address the allegedly coercive conditions of detention or that the conditions of his confinement or situation were such so as to excuse. The court also rejected the contention that an illegal confinement was a defense. The court held that an illegal confinement was not a defense in either a criminal or juvenile-delinquency context to the crimes of assault on a detention officer and escape. Equally unavailing to defendant was his contention that hyperactive syndrome and epilepsy negated the element of intent to commit the assaults.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Liquor Control Commission challenged a judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut) ordering the commission to approve plaintiff company's application for a liquor permit, after the commission had denied the permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company operated a bowling alley where there would be no prohibition against the sale of beer by a duly licensed druggist, hotel, package store, or by certain other establishments. The company applied to the commission for a permit to sell beer in its bowling alley. The commission rejected the application on the basis that only beer could be sold in that district and that under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30-15, 30-37 the only permit which could be issued to a bowling alley was one for the sale of all alcoholic beverages. The company thereupon sought a declaratory ruling by the commission as to whether the commission could, under the statutes, issue a bowling establishment permit limited to the sale of beer only. On appeal from a ruling in favor of the company, the court held that the legislature could rationally make distinctions among establishments based upon the types of activities conducted there, for the purpose of regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court reversed a judgment in defendants' favor and found that plaintiffs did not need to prove any pollution, impairment, or environmental destruction in order to have standing and therefore had standing to bring their action under the act. The court remanded the action and held that the trial court did not apply the act's required burden-shifting test and therefore did not decide whether defendants sufficiently rebutted plaintiffs' prima facie case. The court could not affirm the decision by holding that the same result would have been reached even if the trial court had applied the proper statutory standard because it was not clear that the same result would have been reached. The environmental impact statement in issue failed to consider air quality and was submitted to defendant commissioner after he already had approved the project.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court found that the statutes violated the Establishment Clause because no clear secular purpose justified the prohibition of liquor sales on that day, and the primary effect of the Good Friday prohibition was an impermissible endorsement of the Protestant and Catholic faiths. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30-91, 30-74, and 30-77 resulted in an entanglement between religion and state because the statutes required an impermissible degree of inspection or monitoring of religious institutions or practices. The state was required to monitor the sale of alcohol on Good Friday and thereby required in effect to monitor and enforce observance of a religious holiday by permittees in order to enforce Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Acting on a tip, police stopped a truck driven by defendant and found it, as well as two other vehicles located at defendant's residence, to be stolen.

The trial court entered a judgment of conviction. On appeal, the court set aside the judgment and remanded the case. The court held that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress. The trial court failed to address the legality of the initial stop of defendant's truck. Defendant, as an occupant of the truck, had an interest in continuing his travels without government intrusion. Thus, even though the truck was stolen, his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV could have been violated when the truck was stopped. Further, the trial court failed to resolve the issue as to whether the police lawfully entered defendant's property to conduct the inspection which resulted in the discovery of the other stolen vehicles.

The debtor failed to plead and the trial court entered a judgment of strict foreclosure and issued two contempt orders.

The trial court had an inherent power to disregard sham or frivolous pleadings that were interposed for the purpose of thwarting the orderly progress of a case. The court remanded for calculation of the debt because the debtor did raise a defense concerning the amount of the mortgage debt before the trial court, and under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission adopted a regulation banning through truck traffic on two streets in the city.

On appeal, the court affirmed the relief ordered, but vacated the finding that the statute was unconstitutional because the issue was governed by statute. The court ruled that the resident had standing to bring the action because she suffered direct injury from the noise and vibration of the trucks. The court found that the commission did not rely on its discretion when it removed the signs, but acted solely in response to the LRRC veto of the regulation. The court ruled that the regulation did not fall under the UAPA and was not subject to LRRC review because its impact was not sufficiently general in the state. The court found that the commission was authorized to regulate through truck traffic within a city's limits for public safety in cooperation and agreement with local authorities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners challenged a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Ansonia-Milford at Milford (Connecticut), which dissolved an ex parte temporary injunction and denied permanent injunctive relief to the owners after the owners brought an action seeking to restrain defendants, a city and its officials, from taking any action against the owners under a city housing code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners alleged that the city housing code did not apply to their vacant dwellings. However, in reaching its conclusion to deny injunctive relief to the owners, the trial court passed upon the issue of whether the city housing code, pursuant to Milford, Conn., Housing Code &sect; 11, was preempted by the State Building Code when it came to the issue of vacant dwellings. Thus, on appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in not deciding the issue of preemption as it related to the owner's properties. Specifically, the court held that the power of the city to enact the ordinance, which became the city housing code, depended primarily upon whether it was in conflict with, or inconsistent with, the State Building Code. As a result, the court, although noting that it did not undertake any detailed analysis of the two codes, pointed out that there were at least some apparent conflicts, which required that the trial court reach and resolve the issue of preemption. Thus, the court held that without having disposed of the threshold issue of preemption, the factual determination of the trial court could not stand. Accordingly, the court ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner unsuccessfully challenged the utility company's appointment of a utility receivership to retain the rents from a number of apartment buildings owned by the owner. The owner was indebted to the utility company in excess of $ 9,000. The receivership was terminated and costs, and fees were assessed against the owner. The properties were transferred to a mortgage foreclosure receivership. He had claimed previously that the appointment of a receiver was unconstitutional. The trial court awarded attorney's fees, fees to the receiver, and approved the report of the rent receiver. On appeal, the court noted that there was statutory authority in &sect; 16-262f for the award of fees and that its review was limited to whether the trial court's determination was erroneous. There was no error in permitting the rent receiver to take the rent receipts as a first lien. The award to the rent receiver was permitted under the statute, and the amount was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor brought a foreclosure proceeding wherein the State had an unrecorded tax lien it sought to enforce against the delinquent taxpayer. The State argued that the unrecorded lien was enforceable against the taxpayer because the taxpayer held the equity of redemption in the subject premises. The trial court ruled that the State's recovery was limited to the amount of the lien which was recorded before the notice of lis pendens was filed and that the State forfeited its rights to the balance for its failure to comply with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-325, the lis pendens statute. On appeal the court noted that &sect; 52-325 had been held unconstitutional. The State's tax lien was statutorily created under &sect; 14-420 as soon as the tax remained unpaid after the last day for filing the return. The lien existed whether or not it was recorded. Finding that the State was a proper party to the action, the court found error, and set aside the judgment, remanding for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield (Connecticut), which entered a verdict and judgment of guilty against defendant for sexual assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and kidnapping in the second degree, and which denied his motion for reargument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and kidnapping in the second degree. The lower court imposed separate sentences under each count, to run consecutively. Defendant claimed error in an instruction on intent and in the consecutive sentences for assault and robbery. He argued that lower court's instructions to the jury violated his constitutional right to due process by shifting to him the burden of proof of intent. The court held that the lower court avoided the ambiguous terms &quot;intent&quot; and &quot;act&quot; in the unchallenged portion of the instructions related to sexual assault in the first degree. The court held that because an inference of intent to cause serious physical injury from proof of the circumstances of a multiple stabbing accords with reason, it did not offend due process to inform the jury that the law permitted them to so infer. The court held however that the lower court's instructions on robbery in the first degree and kidnapping in the second degree lacked the precision and comprehensiveness of those given on the crime of assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that there was no error and the judgment was affirmed as to the second and third counts charging sexual assault in the first degree and assault in the first degree, but that there was error as to the first and fourth counts of the information, charging kidnapping in the second degree and robbery in the first degree respectively, and as to those counts only, the judgment was set aside and a new trial was ordered.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the murder and robbery convictions, the court held that there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected defendant's two allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not demonstrate that his counsel's performance was not reasonably competent. The court found no error in the admission of evidence, in the jury instructions, or in objections sustained by the trial court during defendant's cross-examination of witnesses. As to defendant's claim regarding the trial judge's ex parte contact with a juror concerning an exhibit that was ruled to be inadmissible after the juror was allowed to look at it, the court held that even if the contact were improper, defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by it.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the court did not err in refusing to find that the defendant had satisfied his burden of proving his defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The court noted that defendant claimed that the shooting was accidental and also that he acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, and determined that that these two claims could not be reconciled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State charged that defendant was one of three men who committed an armed robbery of two employees at an insurance office. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the out-of-court identifications of him made by both of the employees at the police barracks. Finding error in part, the court set aside defendant's conviction of robbery and remanded for a new trial on that offense, and affirmed defendant's conviction of the remaining offenses. The court held that although the show-up identification procedure used was unnecessarily suggestive, the identification evidence was reliable and the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence of the identifications. However, the trial court erred by instructing the jury that defendant had the &quot;mental state&quot; required for the commission of the robbery offense. The instruction effectively directed a finding of guilty on the issue of defendant's intent in being an accessory to robbery pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-8.
