</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant minor sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which declared the minor to be a ward of the court, placed him under control and supervision of plaintiff probation officer in his parents' home, and suspended his driving license for six months. The probation officer had filed an action to have the minor declared a ward of the court due to a charge of reckless driving causing bodily injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence disclosed that the minor willfully and knowingly drover his vehicle at a high rate of speed directly toward a 14-year-old child in a game of chicken. The child froze with terror, was unable to move out of the direct path of the oncoming vehicle, and consequently was struck and seriously injured. Under the circumstances there was an abundance of evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the minor intentionally drove his vehicle with knowledge that serious injury to the child was probable, or that he intentionally acted with a wanton and reckless disregard of the possible result of his conduct. The court also ruled that there was nothing in the applicable provisions of the Juvenile Court Law that offended the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Under the Juvenile Court Law, the minor was afforded due process of law by review of the judgment of the juvenile court judge on appeal from the judgment rendered upon the rehearing. The minor's claim that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 559 was unconstitutional because of its alleged vagueness and indefiniteness was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Controller of the State of California challenged the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which sustained the objection to an inheritance tax appraiser's report of respondent children of the decedent (children) and fixed inheritance taxes payable on interests that passed from the decedent to his children under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 13693 (1965).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent's father left part of his estate in trust to the decedent, giving the decedent a power of appointment over the trust assets. The decedent's will had a provision in case any child predeceased him. The trust assets were distributed to the children by a court order that made no reference to the decedent's will. The appraiser's report included as a taxable transfer by the decedent to the children one-fourth of the market value of the assets held in the trust. After the trial court sustained the children's objection and ruled that the assets were not transferred subject to the inheritance tax law, the controller appealed. The court affirmed. To the extent that the decedent attempted to appoint the trust property other than to his children living at the date of his death in fee simple absolute, the appointment was a nullity and was not regarded as effecting a transfer subject to inheritance tax. The power of appointment was a limited power, rendering moot any question as to general powers of appointment. The exercise of a power which did not change the estates vested in persons who would take on a failure to exercise the power was not a transfer subject to inheritance tax.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff claimed at trial that defendant struck plaintiff without provocation. Defendant claimed that he struck plaintiff in self defense. After the jury found for defendant, the trial court granted plaintiff's motion for a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Affirming that decision, the court applied the mandate of Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 657 to reverse only if the record contained &quot;no substantial basis&quot; for the trial court's stated reasons and ruled that the trial court was entitled to weigh the evidence and believe plaintiff's account of the events, a version that did not justify the battery, in reaching its conclusion that the jury should have reached a different verdict. The court rejected defendant's argument that the verdict could have been based on the jury's belief that plaintiff suffered no damages and that &sect; 657 required the trial court to include a record of its belief that plaintiff was damaged. The court determined that &sect; 657 did not require the trial to set forth each and every step of its reasoning that led it to grant the motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11530. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that defendant smoked marijuana in his apartment two weeks prior to the charged incident. The court rejected defendant's argument. The court noted that the evidence was introduced at the preliminary examination and, knowing of the admission, defendant agreed to the submission of the case on the transcript from the preliminary examination. The court also observed that the evidence was admissible to show guilty knowledge, as required under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11556. The court further ruled that the acquittal of defendant and all others present in the apartment of possession charges did not require an acquittal of the charge under &sect; 11556. The court emphasized that &sect; 11556 did not require proof of possession. Moreover, the evidence of the presence of marijuana and a strong odor of burning marijuana when officers arrived at defendant's apartment was sufficient to establish that marijuana was unlawfully smoked in his presence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the desirability of the social policy underlying the statute was a purely legislative matter and that it was improper for the court to weigh fact-finding studies against each other. Some studies reported that the use of marijuana, once begun, led to excess, while other studies reported no ill effects of marijuana use. The court found that the accused made no showing that any wrongful discrimination or other impure motive existed for the alleged disparity between the treatment of alcohol and marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant lender challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied it recovery for breach of an agreement under which respondent borrower used its accounts receivable in order to obtain working capital. The trial court also awarded the borrower damages on its cross-complaint for usury. The lender had withheld a reserve of 30 percent of the accounts on several occasions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lender contended that Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22 violated the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. Section 22 provided that the rate of interest upon any loan was to be seven percent per annum, and also provided that parties could contract in writing for a rate not exceeding ten percent. The lender also asserted that the treble damages and misdemeanor provisions of the usury law, Cal. Gen. Laws &sect; 3 (1918), discriminated by penalizing some classes, but not others, for identical acts. The court held that: (1) the lender lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of the usury law because the lender had not sustained and was not in immediate danger of sustaining any direct injury as the result of the usury law's enforcement; and (2) the transaction was an open loan account masquerading as a sale of accounts, which enabled the borrower to procure compensation in excess of the lawful ten percent per annum for the use and forbearance of money. The assignment of the invoices and evidences of debt constituted a pledge for security; thus, the lender's rights terminated when the borrower repaid all sums advanced with the lawful amount of interest.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2814, which required the driver of a passenger vehicle to stop and submit his vehicle to a mechanical inspection where members of the California Highway Patrol were conducting tests and inspections and when signs were displayed requiring such stop, the court reinstated the complaint against defendant charging him with driving while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor. The state could practice preventative therapy through the use of reasonable road checks to ascertain whether drivers and automobiles met the legislative determination of fitness. Defendant's right of mobility was not inalienable, and there had to always be a logical appreciation of the demands of public safety to which an individual's rights and liberties had to yield when balanced against a right that was not fundamental but merely involved a slight inconvenience. The enjoyment of many personal rights and freedoms were subject to restraint under the police power of the state, which restraint might include reasonable conditions to insure the safety, good order, and public welfare of the people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with the misdemeanor of failing to provide worker's compensation coverage. The trial court dismissed the complaint because it was brought more than one year after the date of the offense. The court adopted the opinion of the intermediate appellate court and ruled that the accusatory document was required to state facts which would set forth not only the date of discovery but also would show why, by the use of due diligence, the offense could not have been earlier discovered. In order to comply with the speedy trial and due process clauses, a prosecution for a misdemeanor had to be brought within one year of the date of the offense. This statute of limitations went to jurisdiction, rather than merely to remedy. Because violations of the worker's compensation laws were equated to a case of fraud, the court read into the statute a duty to exercise diligence to discover the facts that constituted the fraud. Thus, the state had to plead and prove lack of knowledge, lack of means of obtaining knowledge, and when and how the fraud was discovered.</SPAN></P>

Prob. Code &sect; 1240. Respondent, the State Controller, opposed the action of the administrator seeking a modification of the order fixing the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testatrix's sister and her sister's husband rejected by a written instrument a remainder interest in the residue of the testatrix's estate. They also rescinded their prior assignment for value of this interest to the life tenant of the interest, the testatrix's husband. The trial court, applying Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code &sect; 13409, fixed the tax in accordance with the report and as if the bequest had not been rejected. The administrator argued that the rejection of the bequest, which ordinarily would have related back to the time of the testatrix's death to prevent vesting of the legacy, created an intestacy with respect to the interest, and that since the entire estate was community property, such interest then passed intestate to the testatrix's surviving husband. The court disagreed. The court found that under &sect; 13409, the rejection of the bequest was merely a renunciation of rights under the will and that &sect; 13409 prevented the renunciation from relating back for inheritance tax purposes. The court noted that the inheritance tax did not deprive a taxpayer of his property without due process of law because the right of inheritance was entirely statutory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While investigating homosexual activity in a park's public rest room, two police officers drilled peepholes in a wall of the men's restroom so that they could see the public portion of the rest room. Defendant was arrested after the officers allegedly witnessed him engaging in homosexual activities. The court overturned the order. First, the court held that when the case against a defendant was a close one, an error which otherwise would not be prejudicial might justify a new trial. Here, the case was a close one in part because of the officers' difficulties in observing suspects through the peepholes. Second, the court held that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it refused to give defendant's requested instruction to the effect that if the jury had a reasonable doubt as to whether the police officers could identify defendant from their place of concealment, the jury should acquit him. Where, as here, an additional reasonable doubt instruction which pointed to the theory of the defense was requested, it was error to refuse to give it, notwithstanding Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1096a. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 288a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The water district appealed and the court reversed. The court held that this kind of district was normally formed and maintained for the purpose of bettering either the water supply or the water service, or both, within its boundaries and that the water district had not done so. The court found that as quasi-judicial proceedings, the district's hearings were fair and that the quasi-legislative policy the board adhered to in its decision against the property owners did not discriminate against them.

The court held that because the corporations represented their forms as an effective means of collecting debts, the corporations were involved in a collection scheme in violation of &sect; 6853 even when they were only selling forms. Because none of the forms contained any expressions of thought, the court held that the corporations' free speech rights were not violated by &sect; 6853 and that the state agency was permitted to enjoin all sales of the collection forms.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an injunction in conformity with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A fire occurred in a building owned by respondent causing damage. At the time of fire the dwelling was insured by appellant under an &quot;open&quot; fire insurance policy. The policy was in substantial compliance with the standard form prescribed by Cal. Ins.

Appellant contested estimates for repair which included costs brought about by changes made in building codes after the building was constructed but before the insurance policy was issued. The trial court allowed increased costs and held the provision of &sect; 2071 which disallows such costs was unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause. On appeal the court found &sect; 2071 was not unconstitutional as the plain language of the statute showed it afforded uniform and equal protection to all building owners under an &quot;indemnity&quot; concept of insurance. Also, recovery for additional costs for reconstructing in compliance with changed building codes was disallowed under &sect; 2051.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment as the insurance code provision was not unconstitutional and the measure of indemnity was the expense of replacing the thing lost or injured in its condition at the time of injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged in the justice court with the illegal use of a speaker mounted on a vehicle, in violation of a county loud speaker control ordinance. Appellant demurred to the complaint, which was overruled. Appellant petitioned the superior court for a writ of prohibition, which was denied. On review, the court reversed judgment with directions to the superior court to issue the writ. The court held that the county ordinance was unconstitutional because it was not a reasonable exercise of police power and presented too much opportunity for discrimination, political preference, and censorship, which was repugnant to a democratic society. Further, the application process for a permit under the ordinance was prone to delay tactics, which was detrimental to freedom of speech. The court recognized that while the state and its subdivisions had the sovereign right to protect the lives, privacy, and property of citizens, and had wide discretion in exercising police power, statutes involving the police power could be declared unconstitutional when they were arbitrary or unreasonable attempts to interfere with the basic rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's motions to dismiss were denied and the trial court found him to be a narcotic addict under Cal.

On appeal, the court affirmed the commitment and denial of appellant's motions to dismiss. The court concluded that there was no illegal search or seizure relevant to appellant and that there was probable cause to arrest appellant based on what officers saw in plain view. Further, the commitment proceeding was civil in nature, not criminal, and, the exclusionary rules applicable to criminal cases were not controlling. The sole issue at trial was whether appellant was a drug addict or, by reason of repeated use of narcotics, was in imminent danger of becoming addicted. The procedural requirements for commitment were strictly followed. Thus, the jurisdiction of the trial court was unaffected by the legality of the arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions for the sale of marijuana, a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11531, and the sale of a substance falsely represented to be a narcotic, a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11503, in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). Defendant argued that remarks of the prosecutor violated defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination and that jury instructions were improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An undercover officer bought a cigarette containing marijuana from defendant, and about a week later, the officer bought a second package from defendant that defendant represented was marijuana. When tested by a chemist, the substance was not a narcotic. Defendant was charged and convicted of violations of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 11531 and 11503. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. A remark by the prosecutor appeared to be a direct reference to defendant's failure to take the witness stand. However, there was no reasonable doubt that the prosecutor's comment did not contribute to defendant's conviction. It was immaterial to a violation of &sect; 11503 whether defendant, either before or at the time of the delivery of the non-narcotic substance, intended to deliver a narcotic or some innocuous material. Section 11503 was violated if there was an offer of a narcotic and a subsequent delivery of a non-narcotic substance. Accordingly, defendant suffered no disadvantage when the trial court imposed the additional requirement of an intent to furnish a narcotic or when it failed to instruct that fraudulent intent was necessary.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that compensation was based on loss imposed on the owners rather than on benefit received by the Department.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The committees were convicted in a municipal court of a drug possession offense and were certified to the trial court for a determination of whether they were addicted or in imminent danger of becoming addicted to narcotics. Two doctors were appointed to examine them, and counsel was also assigned. One doctor testified at a preliminary hearing that they were in imminent danger of becoming addicted to narcotics, and both doctors signed a certificate to that effect. The committees then demanded a jury trial, at which they were called as witnesses to testify against themselves. The trial court committed them. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not sufficiently comply with Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5564 because both doctors who signed the commitment certificate did not testify as required. The trial court's failure to inform the committees that they had a right to present their defense was immaterial because an attorney had been appointed to represent them who told them of the right. Because the commitment was a civil action, not a criminal one, the court rejected the committees' complaints that they were unconstitutionally forced to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A decedent's will was admitted to probate. A state inheritance tax appraisement and report were made and approved. The amount was paid. Thereafter, a federal estate tax return was made, and the amount of state tax actually paid was allowed as a credit against the federal amount due. A state inheritance tax appraiser then filed a &quot;supplemental&quot; report, claiming a further amount due under &sect; 13441, which allowed for an &quot;additional&quot; or &quot;pickup&quot; tax by which the state could take advantage of a revenue raising opportunity. Under &sect; 13441, if an amount allowable was more than what was paid to the state, the difference was imposed as an additional tax. There was no increased liability. Rather, the amount payable to the federal government was instead payable to the state. The objectors challenged the procedural device invoked for the collection of the tax, arguing that the state tax should not have been imposed until after the final determination of the federal tax. The court found, however, that when the estate was valued for federal tax, notification and tender of the amount of any additional tax was to be made and then paid to the state and claimed as a credit against the federal tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers, a husband and wife residing and domiciled in California, claimed that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect;&sect; 17204 and 18001, which respectively denied the deduction and credit, were unconstitutional. The husband was a partner in a law firm with offices in San Francisco and Tokyo. In the California income tax returns for the years at issue, the taxpayers reported their proportionate share of the net income derived from the partnership's Japanese office. Under the law of Japan, an income tax was imposed on the net income derived from the Japanese office. The tax was withheld from clients' payments and sent directly to the Japan revenue office. The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The disallowance of a deduction or credit for taxes paid to a foreign nation was valid under the state constitution in that it was not contrary to any express constitutional provision. The disallowance also did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Commerce Clause, or any other provision of the United States Constitution. Finally, the statutes were not in violation of any treaty between Japan and the United States.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect; 19, as well as by the Fourth Amendment, and further that it failed to state the time of its issuance as required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 815. On appeal, the court held that the description of defendant in the warrant did not meet the constitutional requirement and that the warrant was void for that reason. However, the court determined that it did not follow that defendant's arrest was unlawful simply because the warrant underlying it was void. The court found that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 850 provided that the teletype of the warrant had the same legal effect as the original and that the teletype contained more information and facts than the warrant. The court determined that the officers had sufficient probable cause for the arrest of defendant even without the warrant, holding that the subsequent arrest and search were lawful.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Orange County (California) entered a judgment in favor of the cities and denied the party members' request for injunctive relief. The party members appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The party members contended that the cities' business license ordinances applied only to commercial, profit-making businesses, and did not govern the activities of their nonprofit political newspaper.

In reversing the judgment entered in favor of the cities, the court held that the party members' newspaper was a noncommercial, nonprofit, purely political publication, and that the party members were exempt from the payment of the business license fees. The court observed that any person was exempt from taxation upon any act of distributing information or opinion of any kind, whether political, scientific, or religious in character, when done solely in an effort to spread knowledge and ideas, with no thought of commercial gain. The court found that the primary function of the newspaper was to present the views of the Socialist Party to the paper's subscribers and not to realize a pecuniary profit.</SPAN></P>

The levy had been made by respondent Board of Equalization, pursuant to Cal. Ins.

Appellants' contention that California statute violated commerce and equal protection clauses of U.S. Constitution was without merit because of the provisions of McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1011-1015 and because the imposition of tax was condition precedent to admission to California.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A strike was ongoing against the employer and the unions were involved in picketing activities outside the employer's property. The employer brought an action against the unions, which sought a preliminary injunction.

The court issued a peremptory writ of prohibition that directed the Superior Court of Kern County to refrain from enforcing the portion of the preliminary injunction that prohibited the use of bullhorns in connection with peaceful picketing during daylight working hours. An absolute prohibition of amplified speech was a violation of the rights granted by the First Amendment. The court held that the right to free speech embodied the means used for its dissemination because the right was worthless in the absence of a meaningful method of its expression. The dissemination of information concerning the facts of the labor dispute was regarded as being within the area of free discussion that was protected by the First Amendment. The court found that the use of a bullhorn could be reasonably restricted, but not totally banned.</SPAN></P>

The owners claimed that the section was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court in favor of the city.

The court also held that the requirements levied on the owners under &sect; 12.37 were reasonably related to a public issue, namely increased traffic concerns and increased accessibility. Thus, the court held that the trial court was justified in concluding that the application to the owners of &sect; 12.37 bore a substantial relationship to the accomplishment of a proper public purpose within the police power, and in such application it was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or otherwise unlawful as to them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured in the course of his employment in a vehicle collision with a truck. The insurer was the employee's workmen's compensation carrier.

The trial court entered a judgment that the attorney was entitled to attorney's fees from the insurer's share of the settlement, and the insurer sought review. The court reversed, holding that the settlement was not obtained solely through the efforts of the attorney; therefore the trial court was without authority to impose upon the insurer's share of the settlement an award of attorney's fees. Cal. Labor Code &sect; 3860(c) did not apply; therefore its constitutionality was not determined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff minor appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which sustained a demurrer filed by defendant school board in the minor's action for damages sustained while participating in high school physical education activities. The demurrer was based upon the minor's failure to comply with Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 911.2, 911.4, requiring timely claim filing as a prerequisite to suits against public agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor was injured at school on October 8, 1964. On December 19, 1965, the minor filed an application for leave to present a late claim pursuant to Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 911.4 because the 100-day limitation of &sect; 911.2 to present a claim had passed. The application alleged the minor's minority status as the sole ground of relief. When the school district denied the claim because the application was not filed within one year after the expiration of the 100-day period, the minor filed an action for damages. The school district demurred and the trial court sustained the demurrer. On appeal, the minor asserted that the claim filing statutes were unconstitutional as to minors. The court affirmed, holding that, if a minor filed an application for relief within the one-year extended period fixed by &sect; 911.4, the relief was mandatory, making the claim filing conditions for minors more lenient. There were no arguments presented to establish the claim that the statutes were unconstitutional. In that the minor failed to file her claim within the extended period, the school board and the trial court were powerless to grant relief, and the demurrer was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order sustaining the school district's demurrer and dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court had instructed the jury that defendants were required to establish their defense based on an excessive burden and that defendants were only required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the police had discriminated against them by enforcing the ordinance against them, but not others, who had also posted campaign signs on private property.

At a hearing in front of the board, the doctor was represented by counsel and did not raise the defense of entrapment. The doctor admitted that he was convicted of the felony, that he had self-prescribed morphine and Demerol, but that his personal use of drugs had ended, and that he sold narcotics to an addict outside the regular conduct of his profession and without making records of the sale. The court found that the board's hearing did not violate the Administrative Procedure Act, specifically, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11517. The court further held that because the doctor did not bring up the affirmative defense of entrapment in the administrative hearing, he could not bring up the issue in the mandamus proceeding. The court also denied the doctor's motion to disqualify the judges of the court from hearing the appeal under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 170.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that respondent trial court lacked jurisdiction, and that plaintiff lacked standing to bring a request for relief. The court issued the writ of prohibition requiring respondent court to refrain from issuing the preliminary injunction because the court held that while the trial court had jurisdiction and plaintiff had standing, the trial court lacked the power to issue the proposed injunction as it would unconstitutionally abridge freedom of speech or freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of Santa Clara County refused to grant defendant any relief on his motion for a new trial, made following his conviction for possession of a narcotic, reversal of his sentence by the appellate court, and a remand for sentencing, on the ground that the state of the proceedings was such that it did not have the authority to entertain a motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sentence was reversed because a prior misdemeanor conviction had been treated as a felony during sentencing. On remand, defendant sought a new trial. On appeal, the court held that the affirmance of the issue of guilt on the first appeal precluded the trial court's subsequent review of the issue on a motion for a new trial. The court further held that the scope of the appeal was limited to matters arising in connection with the second sentencing, that the question of unlawfully seized evidence could not be raised on collateral attack, and that defendant did not excuse his failure to raise the objection to the search warrant on his prior appeal. Finally, the court held that defense counsel's failure to question the issuance of the search warrant and to object to the evidence produced thereby was not ineffective assistance. An error in the judgment of whether an affidavit for a search warrant was legally and factually sufficient did not evidence such lack of diligence or competence as to reduce the trial to a farce or sham and the inadequacy of the search warrant did not preclude the use of evidence if other evidence established probable cause for the search.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found for the city in the developer's action to determine whether the city or county controlled water service to the development. The court reversed the decision and held that the county was to provide water to the subdivision. The court held that the city was a &quot;publicly owned utility&quot; as defined in Cal. Water Code &sect; 31053 because it served the public. Also, the county was a municipal corporation. The court held that &sect; 31053 was constitutionally valid under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 19. As a result, the county, and not the city, had the legal obligation to supply water. Therefore, the city's conditions were invalid, and it was not permitted to provide water to the subdivision where that obligation was held by the county unless the city complied with &sect; 31053.</SPAN></P>

The issue of the pedestrian's contributory negligence and his possible &quot;jaywalking&quot; were discussed in the jury arguments of both counsel. The pedestrian contended that the trial court erred in reading to the jury Marysville, Cal., Ordinance No. 678 because he claimed that it conflicted with provisions of the California Vehicle Code, which preempted the field. The city ordinance was an outright prohibition against crossing streets outside of crosswalks. The court held that the ordinance was fully within the terms of the authority conferred by Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 21961 and found no validity in it. The court found that the jury instructions were in conflict. Since the prohibitory ordinance applied, the trial court should not have instructed the jury on the permissive jaywalking rule of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 21954(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted for attempted robbery, assault with intent to commit murder, and robbery of the first degree. On review, defendants argued that their arrest was unlawful and that the search and seizure of two handguns were unconstitutional. The court held that the arresting officers had reasonable and probable cause for the warrantless arrest of defendants. It was found that the arresting officers presumably knew at the time they arrived to arrest defendants that defendants had committed armed robbery and that one of them had used his hand gun in the robbery and wounded one of the victims. Thus, the court concluded that the circumstances warranted the arresting officers' noncompliance with the prior demand and explanation provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 844. Additionally, the court found that at the trial defendants did not object to the arrest and search on the ground that it was unconstitutional and therefore the court could not consider the argument on appeal. The court held that all searches of a suspect's car, other than at the immediate time and in the immediate vicinity of his arrest, were not ipso facto constitutionally unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, investor-owned public utilities, brought an action against defendants, county and county engineer, seeking a declaration that the Water Ordinance, Los Angeles County, Cal., Ordinance 7834, was unconstitutional as applied to them. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County declared the ordinance unconstitutional as applied to the utilities and issued an injunction against its enforcement. The county and the county engineer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The utilities alleged that the Water Ordinance, Los Angeles County, Cal., Ordinance 7834, did not constitutionally apply to them because the state had fully occupied the field of public utilities regulation by adopting Cal. Const. art. XII, &sect; 23 and the Public Utilities Code. At all times the utilities had complied with the provisions of the ordinance, and there had been no prosecution of any of the utilities. Therefore, the county argued that the case was not justiciable. The court held that (1) the controversy was justiciable; (2) the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the utilities because it conflicted with the general law and related to matters which were of state-wide rather than local concern; and (3) the issuance of an ancillary injunction was improper because there was no reason to suppose that either the county or the county engineer was in the least disposed to enforce the ordinance against the utilities in the teeth of a declaration of its unconstitutionality as applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision finding that the water ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the utilities. The court modified the judgment of the trial court by striking the provision therefrom enjoining the county and the county engineer from enforcing the ordinance against the utilities.</SPAN></P>

The service company had filed a proceeding in mandamus to compel the treasurer to issue a license based on one location. The service company challenged the constitutionality of Anaheim, Cal., Mun.

The person operating such a business was known as a &quot;route operator.&quot; The service company tendered an amount computed under the gross receipts provisions of the ordinance contending that it was required to obtain one license; contended that the provisions requiring a separate license for each &quot;branch establishment or location&quot; did not apply to route operators; and demanded a license. The treasurer contended that the service company had 261 locations, each requiring a license. The trial court ordered the city to issue a license. The court reversed. Each washroom location was a business location within the meaning of the ordinance. The sections of the ordinance under review were directed to the taxable event of doing business in the City of Anaheim; met the requirement that the classification or measure of tax used be reasonably related to the objective of the legislation; did not unlawfully discriminate against the route operator; and did not impose a tax in an amount that was confiscatory or as a subterfuge to eliminate competition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the landowner was in violation of the municipality's building, electrical, and plumbing codes, and concluded that the ordinance was constitutional. On appeal, the court found that the ordinance was designed to regulate various businesses, including mobile vending establishments. The court also found that the ordinance was based on public health and safety considerations, such as preventing unsafe or dangerous uses of property. The court concluded that the ordinance was not an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the municipality's police power. The ordinance bore a reasonable relationship to the proper purposes of zoning. Therefore, the court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the surety, having breached its obligation under the bond, could not collaterally attack the proceedings in the municipal court, based upon the alleged insanity of the principal. It was not shown that the principal was physically unable by reason of illness or insanity to appear in the municipal court. The court ruled that is was mandatory upon the surety under Cal.

The court first held that the trial court was not required to instruct the jury that defendant was not required to render assistance if the victim was being adequately cared for by others. The court held that omission to perform any of the acts required in the statute constituted the offense. In any case, the court held that failure to give such an instruction did not prejudice defendant's case. The court held that there was ample reason for the jury to conclude that defendant did not engage in the process of helping.

Code &sect; 1953f, even though the person who actually took defendant's fingerprints and made the card was not called as a witness, because the card was verified as authentic; (2) defendant's statements after his arrest and prior to his being advised of his rights to counsel and to remain silent that were used for the purpose of obtaining a voice identification because they did not elicit incriminating information; (3) statements made by defendant in which he falsely identified himself to the police; and (4) several articles taken from defendant's apartment at the time of his arrest because there was a nexus between the items seized and defendant's criminal behavior.

The drug manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer knew that tests of its drug on various animals had resulted in, inter alia, abnormal blood changes and serious eye damage, but concealed the negative results and falsified positive test results, leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the drug. The court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury that a violation of &sect; 355(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which required submission of reports of investigations, created a rebuttable presumption of negligence. The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury that &sect; 355(b) required anything less than submission of all relevant data which bore upon the safety of the drug. The manufacturer's statements regarding the safety of the drug, even if only expressions of scientific opinion, supported an action for fraud and deceit, because it had superior knowledge regarding the subject matter of the representations, and the patient and his physician reasonably relied on that knowledge. Finally, the court properly instructed the jury on the issue of implied warranty, because the drug had been placed upon the market and sold without adequate and proper warning.</SPAN></P>

The state sought review, and the court reversed the order. The court held that &sect; 647 was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality and was not vague merely because it gave police discretion in deciding when to temporarily detain persons for questioning. Detaining persons on the street for questioning was permissible short of probable cause as long as the officers had at least a reasonable suspicion. Also, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(e) did not violate the self-incrimination privilege because asking a person to produce identification did not constitute self-incrimination.

The trial court overruled the city's general demurrer and commanded the city to set aside one of the conditions. The city appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the petition was not sufficient to have withstood the general demurrer because the facts alleged failed to show the landowners' entitlement to relief. The court found that the landowners could have been entitled to relief under either traditional mandamus or administrative mandamus. The court said that the first did not apply because the landowners had not sought the enforcement of purely ministerial duties. The court held that the second did not apply because the landowners had not shown that the city's actions were in excess of its jurisdiction, that there was not a fair trial of factual matters, or that there was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the employment contracts, because the authority had the power to give fixed terms of employment, the contracts delegated administrative duties only, and the compensation was not a gift forbidden by Cal.

Therefore, employees could be discharged only for good cause, which was an issue of fact for the jury. The jury properly found that a secret monitoring system to prevent communist infiltration was installed in good faith to further the best interests of the authority and did not justify discharge of employee who installed it. Employee's compelled testimony was not grounds for discharge. On the authority's counterclaim, the court held that the authority could not assume the legal expense of its agents in these circumstances.  Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 1956.

The board ordered that the officers were entitled to a larger amount of retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Shortly before the officers retired, the legislature amended the statute relating to military retirement.

The officers had each served more than 20 years in full time active service, with an additional 2 or 3 years on inactive reserve status. The controller computed the officers' retirement benefits under the amendments. The board ordered that they should receive their benefits under the old calculation, but the controller refused. The trial court denied the officers' petition for a writ of mandamus. On appeal, the court reversed. The court refused to apply the amendments retrospectively. The court found that the officers had a vested right in the benefits as they were under the original law which could not be abolished or impaired, although they could be modified, under Cal.

The state's motion to strike the prior conviction was granted and the issue was moot. On appeal, the court affirmed the order because: the cross-examination of defendant regarding the prior conviction was not a prejudicial error; and as there was no showing that the testimony of the state's chief witness was inherently improbable, the court would not reweigh that evidence. The court found that a defendant who took the stand as a witness could be impeached in the same manner as any other witness. Because the testimony elicited from defendant that he had been previously convicted and served a term in state prison did not violate his federal or state constitutional rights and the trial judge had given a proper instruction to the jury on the jury's use of the evidence, defendant could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the conviction on several grounds. On appeal, the court did not find any merit in defendant's contentions, and affirmed his conviction.

Further, defendant's evidence regarding his intoxication and his impotency were questions of fact that were presented to the jury, which were resolved against defendant. Next, the court found &sect; 220 was not unconstitutionally vague because assault was defined as an unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another. Even if it was assumed that defendant was impotent and incapable of rape, such impotence did not necessarily preclude his committing an assault.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state agency argued that the words &quot;practicing beauty culture&quot; contained in Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6522 meant persons licensed to practice cosmetology. The state agency further argued that the acts of an individual who cut hair as a part of the practice of cosmetology constituted the practice of barbering. The court rejected the state agency's arguments. The court concluded that the individual who cut hair as a part of his practice of cosmetology as permitted by Cal. Bus &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 7321 was not engaged in the practice of barbering, as set forth in Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6250. That being the case, the trial court properly concluded that the individual did not engage in the practice of barbering and, thus, the state agency did not have the authority to annul the barbershop owner's barbershop certificate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the agents and the studio claimed that the customer did not demand performance prior to suit, that there was no set time for performance, that there existed no actual agency between the studio and its agents, and that there was extensive performance. The court found that despite the contractual terms to the contrary, there existed an agency relationship and that the customer demanded performance by showing up for dance lessons that had been paid for.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought review of an order of the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of Kern County (California), which held that its ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellee hotelkeeper was charged with failure to remit monies to the municipal tax collector. The case was certified to the court under Cal. R. Ct. 63(a) to determine whether criminal procedure was available in the absence of a mens rea in tax collection matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city had amended its ordinance to lay a tax upon all persons lodging in the city consisting of four percent of the room rent. The court held that this method of tax collection was a legitimate exercise of authority, the monies collected by the hotelkeeper were trust monies and the city's property, and that the hotelkeeper was required to account for them and pay them to the tax collector. The court noted that the question was whether the ordinance authorized a criminal prosecution. The complaint alleged that the hotelkeeper wilfully and unlawfully failed to make the required payments. The court held that in an offense of this kind it was not necessary to have a fraudulent intent, or any intent other than the intent to perform the specified act entirely apart from motive, or evil intention. However, the court held that the attempted conviction for failure to make the payments described in the ordinance was rendered ineffective because the state had taken over the entire field of punishment for a refusal to pay public monies to the proper official. The court held that the city's attempt to impose a different penalty was thus null and void under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the judgment of the district court and sustained the dismissal of the city's complaint, and held that the city's attempt to impose a penalty for the violation of its ordinance was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the physicians, surgeons and medical clinics argued, inter alia, that &sect; 654 was arbitrary and capricious and that the statute should not be applied to partnerships of doctors. The board, on the other hand, argued that &sect; 654 should be applied to corporations in which doctors held stock. The appellate court rejected the parties' contentions and affirmed the trial court's judgment in all respects, holding, inter alia, (1) that &sect; 654 was constitutional, (2) that the statute applied to partnerships of doctors, and (3) that the legislature did not intend for the statute to apply to corporations in which doctors held stock.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the teacher was arrested for a homosexual incident, he refrained from contesting a charge of disorderly conduct in exchange for the dismissal of a more serous charge. The board of education revoked his teaching credential on the ground that he had engaged in immoral and unprofessional conduct within the meaning of Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 13202. The trial court denied the teacher's petition for a writ of mandate, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The teacher was not prejudiced in the trial court by the board's erroneous finding that he teacher's conviction had been based on a plea of guilt. Thus, the error could not be used as a basis for reversal. The testimony of witnesses constituted more than ample credible and competent evidence that the teacher committed a homosexual act. There was an obvious rational connection between the teacher's homosexual conduct and the consequent action of the board in revoking the credential on the statutory ground of immoral and unprofessional conduct and evident unfitness for service in the school system. The board had not abused its discretion in the penalty imposed nor were there any constitutional questions with respect to the board's actions.</SPAN></P>

The university' disciplinary procedure did not deprive the students of procedural due process. The students were not deprived of procedural due process when the disciplinary committee did not follow the rules of evidence usually applicable in judicial proceedings and chose not to recognize the privilege against self-incrimination. The committee's failure to hear the tape of the language used by the students in the context of their rally did not infringe on the students' rights to procedural due process. The record indicated that whatever their personal reactions, the acting chancellor and president of the university did everything in their power to perfect and assure the students' rights of procedural due process.

The court held that the language used in the statute was sufficiently definite to provide a satisfactory standard of conduct for the medical profession whose activities it was designed to regulate and that it was not subject to the constitutional attack leveled at it by the doctor. The doctor also contended that he was entrapped by the agents of the board into issuing the prescriptions. The court found the witnesses had been told not to pretend illness. Upon the facts proved, it was clear that the doctor was seduced in a truly professional manner, but the court could not say as a matter of law that he was entrapped in a legal sense of that term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant heir challenged the order of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) which instructed appellee guardian not to make gifts from the principal of the ward's estate, but which authorized payment from the surplus income of the estate pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1558. The guardian, who was also appellant heir, had sought gifts for each of the adult children and grandchildren to avoid higher estate taxes upon the ward's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon petition for authorization to make gifts from the ward's estate to her children and grandchildren to effect tax savings against the estate at the time of the ward's death, the lower court found that it did not have the power to authorize gifts from the principal of the estate. But the lower court authorized a smaller gift from the surplus of the net income used for the ward's expenses. On a challenge by appellant heir, who was also appellee guardian, the court reversed the order, holding that the lower court had the authority to determine whether to authorize transfers of the ward's property to avoid unnecessary taxes or administrative expenses where it appeared that the ward, as a reasonably prudent person, would have done so had she been competent. The criteria for determining authorization included permanency of the condition, needs of the ward, devolution of the property, and donative intent. Having found sufficient evidence that the ward would have made the gifts to effect tax savings if she could have afforded to do so without prejudicing her welfare, the court remanded for findings on the amount the ward would have given based on her economic needs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant redevelopment agency (agency) petitioned the court for a writ of prohibition ordering respondent Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) to desist from any further proceedings in an action after the trial court denied its motion to dismiss the action pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 863. Plaintiff taxpayers brought the action to invalidate a redevelopment plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The agency argued that taxpayers failed to have proper summons issued and failed to commence and complete proper publication of summons and file proof thereof within 60 days from the filing of their complaint and did not make a sufficient showing of good cause for their failure to do so. The taxpayers argued that they should not be penalized because of their attorney's failure to recognize that when he prepared and filed the complaint the procedure for testing the validity of the redevelopment plan was controlled by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 860-870 and not by the earlier sections of the law that had been repealed. The court rejected the argument that the failure constituted a mistake of law that justified a finding of good cause as required by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 863. Therefore, the court found that the taxpayers' failure to comply with &sect; 863 required the trial court to dismiss the action on the agency's motion. The court found that where the original summons was fatally defective and no summons was published within the prescribed time, the publication of a &quot;corrected&quot; summons long after the expiration of the statutory 60-day period did not confer jurisdiction over the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a peremptory writ of prohibition restraining the trial court from taking any further proceedings in the action other than to enter an order dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>

Later, a correction superintendent certified that defendant was not a fit subject for confinement or treatment in the rehabilitation center. The referral to the superior court was based on defendant's continuing acts of violence and apparent inability to benefit from the program. Defendant was then sentenced to State prison. Defendant contended that: (1) the trial court was without power to reassume criminal jurisdiction; (2) his rejection from the narcotics program was improper; (3) failure to give him a judicial hearing on his rejection violated due process. Defendant asked that he be returned to the superior court for commitment under the rehabilitation program or, in the alternative, that the criminal proceedings be dismissed. The court found that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3053 did not expressly provide for a certain hearing, but it had a built-in safeguard of due process rights: a court had to hold &quot;a hearing&quot; to reassume criminal jurisdiction and to ask whether legal cause existed.

However, &sect; 844.6 of the act provided that, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the county was not liable for injuries to the inmate. By referring to their legislative history, the court reconciled the two sections to hold the county liable. The court also held that the power of the legislature to control public-entity immunities and tort liability was broad.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the one man one vote doctrine did not apply to the special irrigation district because it did not possess any of the essential characteristics which required application of the doctrine. The court explained that the irrigation district was formed to distribute sufficient water and the accomplishment of such purposes did not require an exercise of government powers. The court nevertheless found that although the irrigation district board did have broad discretion to make changes to the district boundaries, such discretion was not unfettered. The court found that the irrigation district board abused its discretion because the population disparity was extreme and no boundary changes were made in over 30 years.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 211. The People moved to dismiss the appeal for failure of defendant to comply with the requirement of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1237.5, which required that he obtain a certificate of probable cause from the trial court in order to perfect an appeal after his plea of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and two codefendants all pleaded not guilty to charges of robbery and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery and were tried jointly without objection. The two codefendants' confessions, which clearly implicated defendant as a participant in the robbery, were received into evidence with an admonition that they were not to be considered against defendant, a practice later disapproved as prejudicial. All three then changed their pleas to guilty on the robbery charge, and the kidnapping charge was dismissed. Defendant prepared and filed a notice of appeal in propria persona, which would have been timely and effective but for the provisions of &sect; 1237.5, which required that a certificate of probable cause be obtained from the trial court. The court allowed defendant to seek the certificate from the trial court, but the trial court refused. The court then dismissed the appeal, finding that under &sect; 1237.5 no appeal could be taken once the trial court denied the certificate. In addition, defendant's guilty plea eliminated such procedural questions as the propriety of a joint trial, and his not having sought leave to withdraw the guilty plea was another reason for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bar owners operated several bars in the county where they employed topless waitresses. The county and the sheriff intended to enforce a local ordinance against the bar owners, which required them to obtain an entertainment license in order to employ topless waitresses. The bar owners sought an injunction from the trial court to enjoin the county and the sheriff from enforcing the ordinance against them, contending that they were exempt from the ordinance because they were licensed by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and that the requirement violated their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression. The trial court granted the injunction . The county and the sheriff appealed. On appeal, the court reversed, ruling that the mere fact that the bar owners had a liquor license did not exempt them the requirement of the entertainment license, since the denial of one did not prohibit the other. There was no constitutional violation because the commercial aspects of a business enterprise were not protected interests. Finally, the bar owners were premature in seeking an injunction where they had not yet applied for or been refused the entertainment license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant sought to use his credit card with a merchant, the creditor told the merchant not to return the card because defendant was unable to pay his debt. Defendant assaulted the merchant to get the card back. As a term of defendant's probation, defendant was ordered to pay the entire debt. Defendant claimed that the sentence was improper because he would have been imprisoned for the failure to pay the debt, which was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The court affirmed the sentence. Because probation was given as a matter of grace by the trial court, restitution was proper under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.1 and was not unconstitutional. There was no violation of due process in the determination of how much defendant owed the creditor because defendant never disputed the debt's amount. However, the court reversed and remanded the probation condition that defendant re-pay the entire debt because the entire debt was unrelated to the assault where defendant had legally used the card, though he was unable to pay the debt. The cause was remanded for the trial court to re-consider the probation terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state argued that the action was time-barred under Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 641, 644. Plaintiffs contended that the statute of limitations was tolled by the moratorium legislation contained in the 1961 Cal. Stat. ch. 1404, &sect; 4 and that their cause of action arose when their verified claim was rejected by the board of control. Because that rejection occurred after 1961, plaintiffs asserted that the statute of limitations did not commence until 91 days after the final adjournment of the 1963 regular session of the Legislature. Plaintiff minors contended additionally that the statute of limitations did not begin to run as to them until they had reached the age of majority. The court affirmed the state's summary judgment, holding that plaintiffs' cause of action arose on the date of death pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 377. The filing and rejection of the claim were merely conditions attached to the permission to commence the action.  Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 644 barred the cause of action six months after plaintiffs' claims were rejected because the death occurred before the 1961 legislation.  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 352 did not extend plaintiff minors' period of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband's wife was adjudged insane and committed to a state hospital. In the judgment of commitment the husband was not ordered to pay for the care of his wife, but in a statement of financial ability, the court found that he was able to pay for the care. During his lifetime he did not pay for the wife's care at the state hospital. After the husband's death, the Department filed a verified creditor's claim for her care at the state hospital and it was rejected. The husband's estate argued that Cal. Welfare and Institutions Code violated the equal protection provision of the Constitution and that it was unconstitutional to compel anyone to pay for the care of an incompetent relative in a state mental institution. The court stated the husband's obligation to support his wife did not cease when she was adjudged insane. The court determined that the class of &quot;husband&quot; was not an arbitrary and unreasonable classification because the common law and other statutes codified the moral obligation of the husband to support his wife in sickness and in health. Thus, the class of &quot;husband&quot; was reasonably supported by rational basis and &sect; 6650 did not deny the husband equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court had properly taken judicial notice of the first decree in ruling on the demurrer and that a dismissal with prejudice was res judicata of the executor's claim. Where property rights were acquired under a decision holding a statute constitutional, those rights were not invalidated by a subsequent contrary decision and in such cases the new rule was only given prospective effect.

The prior conviction increased his maximum term from 10 years to 20 years, and he asserted that his conviction was under that portion of &sect; 11721 that was since held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) petitioner had the burden of showing that his conviction rested upon the unconstitutional, rather than the valid, portion of the statute; (2) although a plea of guilty to the conjunctive charge would have admitted the use of narcotics in addition to addiction, the case was tried to a jury; (3) the jury instructions reflected that the trial court read the conjunctive charge as given in the information, but it later read disjunctive language of the statute itself, which permitted the jury to convict petitioner for addiction; (4) because no transcript was available, the unconstitutional part of the statute was a possible alternative sole sufficient ground of conviction; and (5) an attack made by petitioner upon the conviction itself was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the superior court's decision, holding that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 7523 permitted local regulation of private patrol operators, and it was not an unconstitutional delegation of state legislative authority. California, by virtue of its enactment of the Private Investigator and Adjuster Act &sect; 7500 et seq. had not preempted the field of disciplinary action with respect to private patrol operators so as to make unlawful such a local ordinance providing for revocation of a private patrol operator's permit to operate in the county. Further the permit revocation procedure provided for in San Mateo County, Cal., Ordinance &sect; 5620.8 did not violate procedural due process under either the federal or state constitutions.

Jurisdiction to enter an order of civil commitment to the narcotic addict rehabilitation program depended on strict compliance with each of the specific statutory prerequisites for maintenance of the proceeding. The requirements respecting notice of hearing fell within that category.

Defendant claimed that the trial court erroneously imposed upon defendant the burden of proving the defense of entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that entrapment did not go to the question of guilt or innocence. The availability of the defense depended upon whether the intent to commit the crime originated in the mind of defendant or in the mind of the entrapping officer, and where a defendant had a preexisting criminal intent, the fact that when solicited by a decoy he committed a crime did not show entrapment. Viewing the evidence of entrapment in the light most favorable to defendant, it contained nothing going to the elements of the crime. The record could not have been construed to negate defendant's intent to make the several sales charged. At most, it showed that this intent was induced by acts of law enforcement officers. Defendant had the burden of persuasion or the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly found that the Indians were full-blooded Yurok or Lower Klamath River Indians, descendants of Lower Klamath River Indians who were allotted specific tracts of land in the Hoopa Extension. The court also found that both were enrolled as Klamath River or Yurok Indians and as &quot;wards&quot; of the federal government on the 1931, 1937, and 1940 rolls of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau), as well as the Bureau's roll of living allottees and direct descendants of allottees on the Hoopa Extension.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a state's department of mental hygiene, sought review of a judgment from the Municipal Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which was in favor of defendant estate administrator in an action for costs of care furnished to the decedent's wife as a patient in a state mental institution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator denied liability by contending that precedent rendered unconstitutional the portions of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6650 that provided for the liability which the department sought to impose. The case in question had provided that an adult child could not be charged for costs incurred by her mentally ill parent while the latter was a patient in a state mental hospital. Thus, on appeal of the judgment for the administrator, the issue was whether the estate of the deceased husband was liable on the department's claim for the care furnished to the decedent's deceased wife as a patient in a state mental institution during their joint married life. Upon its examination of the relevant precedent, the court determined that the case stood for the proposition that no person or class of persons were to be charged with support where no rational basis would underlie the classification. Given that the state had a legitimate interest in a husband's support of his wife, the department had a right to seek reimbursement from the husband, as he was otherwise legally responsible for the care, support, and maintenance of his wife while she was treated at the facility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The card players filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief that sought a determination as to whether the card game of panguingue was one of skill or chance. The county had an ordinance that imposed criminal sanctions upon persons that played certain card games within the county. The court reversed the injunction and held that the card players failed to allege throughout their pleadings any basis upon which the trial court could have granted an injunction. The card players did not allege that the ordinance was unconstitutional, or that the enforcement of the ordinance would have involved the invasion of property rights, which would have resulted in irreparable injury. The court determined that there was no property right and the threat of arrest under the circumstances was not a proper basis to have permitted the trial court to grant the injunctive relief. The court held that in the absence of a deprivation of a constitutional right or other essential facts, there was no basis to have allowed the trial court to grant declaratory relief or to have issued the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The school district appealed. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that the clubs at issue were in fact &quot;secret&quot; as described by the legislature, meaning that membership was exclusive in those social clubs which, operating off-campus, nevertheless derived their membership wholly or in part from high schools, and clubs that practiced a process of selection to create a membership composed of the &quot;socially elite&quot; and which sought by such process to maintain that class segregation, by self-perpetuation, &quot;rushing,&quot; &quot;pledging,&quot; and admitting a limited number of new members. The court declared such clubs &quot;secret&quot; clubs as a matter of law, and found that rules prohibiting the clubs did not violate the First Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, or Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the orders of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) which convicted him, after a bench trial, of the illegal sale of heroin. Pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 6451, the trial court found that defendant was addicted to heroin and made a commitment order. The Director of Corrections certified that defendant was not a fit subject for treatment. He was returned to the trial court, where a prison sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised the issue of the constitutionality of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 6453, under which the Director of Corrections returned defendant to the trial court. He argued that the trial court erred in rejecting his challenge to the process. The court found no basis to rule that the &sect; 6453 was unconstitutional. The statutory scheme provided screens for eligibility. A trial judge instituted commitment proceedings in cases where addiction was seen unless he found that a defendant was not a fit subject for commitment. The final decision of whether a defendant was likely to be helped by treatment was placed in the hands of experts in rehabilitation; it was not left to the determination of the trial judge. As a defendant had no absolute right to treatment under the program, continuance of treatment could properly be based on any reasonable criterion. The record showed that defendant was unwilling or unable to participate in the rehabilitation center programs. Finally, the evidence supported defendant's conviction because he had delivered heroin to an officer.</SPAN></P>

The superior court held that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and various state constitutional provisions, and declared that no inheritance tax was due. The court reversed the judgment or the superior court, holding that the resulting distinction in the treatment of land purchased with California funds as opposed to Ohio funds was permissible because it was part of an overall scheme to assimilate the rights of a nonacquiring spouse in marital property acquired elsewhere with the rights of California domiciliaries, rather than a distinction based strictly upon the source of the taxpayer's funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted defendant of simple assault after entry of defendant's guilty plea to that charge as a lesser included offense in the crime of grand theft from the person, which was the crime charged in the information. Defendant argued that she was never properly arraigned because simple assault was not necessarily included in the charged offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that simple assault was necessarily included in the grand theft crime charged in the information. On appeal, the court affirmed on other grounds. The record established that all parties had assumed that the assault was a lesser-included offense in the crime of grand theft. The purpose of an arraignment was to inform an accused of the charge and to give her an opportunity to plead to it or to move to set it aside. Defendant was properly arraigned on the grand theft charge and was given an opportunity to plead to that charge. Instead, defendant chose to plead guilty to assault because it was assumed to have been an included offense. Although the arraignment was technically flawed, a technical impropriety could be waived by acquiescence where no substantial impairment of rights occurred, and there was no evidence to indicate that defendant's rights were impaired by the acceptance of her plea. Consequently, the court held that defendant's guilty plea to simple assault constituted her admission that assault was included within the language of the information and that it amounted to a waiver of her right to complain about the procedural error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere but, before sentencing, the proceeding was suspended and defendant transferred to the trial court for proceedings to determine whether he was a mentally disordered sex offender. Defendant was admitted to the state hospital for a 90-day examination period and was subsequently committed thereto for an indefinite period. Six months later, defendant requested that the superintendent of the hospital file a report pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5519. The report indicated that defendant was still a danger to society but that he had received maximum hospital benefits. The report recommended that defendant be committed to other facilities of the department for an indeterminate period. The court held that the trial court erred in concluding that it could not appoint independent psychiatrists to examine defendant because, in a recommitment hearing granted under &sect; 5519, it was mandatory that such doctors be appointed. The court concluded that defendant had the right to be represented by counsel, present witnesses, and cross-examine witnesses.</SPAN></P>

Expenses were paid out of the gross income of the machines, and the owners and partnership split the remaining income. The partnership paid income tax on its net income. The board determined that the partnership was not entitled to deduct its expenses and assessed a deficiency for the entire amount of the machines' income, including the nongambling machines. On appeal, the State Board of Equalization affirmed the assessment but modified it downwards because the partnership was involved in joint ventures with the owners, who were responsible for half the income tax. The modified assessment was affirmed on judicial review and the taxpayers paid it. On appeal, the court affirmed that the partnership was not entitled to deductions for its illegal gambling activities under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330b.  Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.

For the past 10 years, he personally sold oranges from a location in Santa Clara County. The oranges were stored in open field containers and sold in varying quantities. The director of agriculture filed suit against the grower for civil penalties and injunctive relief for violations of Cal. Agric. Code &sect;&sect; 784, 796.2, which imposed requirements for standardized packaging and size of fruit. The statute allowed an exemption for a grower who sold fruit near the point of production so long as the selling location was within the county where the fruit was grown. After a hearing, the trial court granted a preliminary injunction against the grower. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: 1) the grower was not a &quot;retailer&quot; within the meaning of the statutes as that term applied to one who bought fruit for resale and had previously met standardization requirements; 2) statutory enactments relative to standard containers for foodstuffs were a valid exercise of the police power; and 3) the county line limitation was reasonably related to preventing harmful intrastate marketing practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department attempted to condemn a parcel of property pursuant to Cal. Sts. &amp; High.

The department's condemnation of portions of two small parcels left a third parcel, comprised of 54 acres, completely landlocked. The property owners challenged the action, claiming that the department's attempt to condemn the largest parcel was not for a public use. They claimed that &sect; 104.1 was unconstitutional. The trial court entered an interlocutory judgment, finding that the taking was not for public use and ordering that condemnation of the smaller parcels proceed to trial along with severance damages for the largest parcel. On appeal, the court held that the judgment was a nonappealable interlocutory judgment. It would have addressed the constitutional question, but it had not been presented with an appropriate writ of prohibition or of mandate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The realty corporation sought a writ of mandate or writ of certiorari commanding the city official to issue a building permit for which it had applied and to rescind his action denying the permit. The realty corporation also sought an injunction against the enforcement of a certain zoning ordinance and a judgment that the ordinance was null and void insofar as it affected its property. The trial court denied the relief sought by the realty corporation and the court affirmed. The court held that the realty corporation did not have a vested right to build where it had not yet obtained a building permit. The City of Los Angeles was not estopped from enforcing an ordinance to zone the realty corporation's property in a manner inconsistent with the realty corporation's plans. The court rejected the realty corporation's argument that it had a nonconforming use protected by &sect; 21.23C of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. The court held that the activity of the realty corporation at the time it became subject to a zoning ordinance, and not its plans regarding the future use of that property, determined the scope of the nonconforming use excepted from the restrictions imposed by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), denying his petition for an alternative and permanent writ of prohibition in which he argued, as he did in his demurrer, that the State's complaint charging him with seven violations of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 146c and seven violations of Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code &sect; 17500, was based on statutes that were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Abandoning his challenge of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17500, defendant argued on appeal that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 146c failed to meet the requirements of due process because its language, in proscribing the designation of any organization that included &quot;peace officer, police, or law enforcement&quot; in its name unless 90 percent or more of the members fit the categories, was vague and indefinite. The statute further prohibited the solicitation of members to such organization. On appeal, defendant argued that the statutory language failed to provide a sufficiently explicit standard for persons subject thereto and that the mere act of &quot;designating&quot; was not, under any circumstances, a crime. In rejecting defendant's arguments, the court held that the subject phrase provided adequate warning of the conduct proscribed and furnished a sufficiently distinct standard for the administration of &sect; 146c. Moreover, defendant used a specific name example that &sect; 146c barred in soliciting others to subscribe to a publication. Further, defendant was foreclosed from challenging the designation portion of the statute because he lacked standing to do so as he was charged with the solicitation portion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which denied defendant's motion to release to him certain property used as an exhibit in a forgery prosecution and other property retained by the police that was not introduced into evidence. Defendant filed the motion after his conviction for forgery became final. The People filed a motion to dismiss defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant forged the signature of a payor on checks, cashed them, received money from the persons cashing the checks, and was convicted of forgery. Upon defendant's arrest, the police removed cash from defendant and took possession of items of personal property. Some of the property, including money, was admitted into evidence at trial as exhibits, and the police retained the property that was not admitted. Defendant argued that he was permitted to appeal the order under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1237(3) because it affected his substantial rights. In dismissing the appeal, the court held that defendant had mistaken his remedy. Defendant sought the return of the exhibits under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1418, which was permissive in nature and did not confer upon defendant a right to obtain release of the exhibits. The order did not affect any substantial right that was a part of the criminal action because the order did not involve the forgery charge against defendant or his rights as affected by the charge. Further, the return of the property not admitted into evidence was wholly without statutory authorization. Thus, the order was not appealable under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1237(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded the agent $ 13, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the written agreement was illegal, and it could not support an award for damages for its breach. The court found that the contract violated the provisions of the Labor Code relating to private employment agencies and contravened the intention of the legislature in enacting statutes for the protection of job-seeking workers. The court held that the contractual scheme resembled a registration fee prohibited by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1633.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroad, as the owner of property abutting on South Alameda Street in Los Angeles, applied for a permit to build a warehouse thereon.

The trial court found against the railroad on its claims that &sect; 12.37 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the facts at bar. The railroad appealed. The court affirmed, holding that a city could require the dedication of land for the widening of an existing street as a condition to its approval of a subdivision map, and such a condition, where reasonably related to the increased traffic and other needs of the proposed subdivision, did not constitute a taking of private property without compensation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Five members of the American Nazi Party, wearing party uniforms, steel helmets, and swastika armbands, picketed a meeting held to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the independence of Israel. Public disorder resulted, and all five were convicted and sentenced on charges of conspiracy and assault by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). Three defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the jury instructions defined disturbing the peace to include acts tending to provoke others to disturb the peace and that consequently the jury was given the erroneous impression that it could consider defendants' use of provocative slogans, symbols, and costumes as evidence of a conspiracy to riot. The court reversed the conspiracy convictions but affirmed the assault convictions. Under the First Amendment, it could not be made an offense merely to invite dispute or to bring about a condition of unrest. Moreover, California did not recognize the doctrine that fighting words or insulting language justified an assault. Thus, the court concluded that the instructions unconstitutionally invaded the domain of free speech by suggesting to the jury that it could infer a conspiracy to riot from defendants' display of provocative signs and slogans which could incite others to break the peace. The jury was not told that those picketed had no right to break the peace or resort to violence. Finally, assaults committed in the course of picketing or of public demonstrations could, as here, be promptly and severely punished under the California Penal Code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgments of conviction for all defendants as to the conspiracy count but affirmed the judgments of conviction as to the assault counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff teacher appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which found in favor of defendant, the California State Teachers' Retirement Board, in the teacher's action to have certain 1957 amendments to the Education Code declared unconstitutional and to have her pension payments computed pursuant to the statutes in effect in 1955.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher contended that certain 1957 amendments to the Education Code, set forth in 1957 Cal. Stat. 2118, p. 3751, were unconstitutional as applied to her because they reduced her pension as it should have been computed under the law in effect on July 1, 1956. On appeal, she asserted that the Board's and the trial court's computation resulted in a reduction from the allowance to which she became entitled by engaging in employment under the provisions of the 1955 amendments to the Education Code, set forth in 1955 Cal. Stat. 1395, p. 2491. The court held that the Board and trial court did not err in construing the applicable statutory provisions. The court found that the construction of the statutes sought by the teacher, the majority of whose service was part-time, would have given her a windfall as compared with full-time employees. The court reasoned that under the teacher's construction, a lifetime full-time teacher and a former part-time teacher who both had the same &quot;final compensation&quot; at the time of eligibility for retirement would have received the same allowance.</SPAN></P>

A police officer testified that defendant had made statements about playing pool during the first robbery. Defendant was convicted, and the trial court imposed concurrent sentences on the robbery, attempted robbery, and one assault charge, and imposed a consecutive sentence on the second assault conviction. The court held that the testimony of several witnesses was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of the charges. The court determined that the officer's testimony was admissible for the limited purpose of showing prior inconsistent statements by defendant. The court found that one of the assault convictions had to be vacated because attempted robbery required one act of violence and the separate conviction resulted in multiple punishment for the same offense.</SPAN></P>

The lower court vacated the order revoking the licenses and the court reversed. It rejected respondents' contentions that &sect; 7113.5 was unconstitutional because it discriminated against contractors who resorted to bankruptcy. Instead, the court held that the statute was a valid exercise of the police power where the bankruptcy related to the licensee's business as a contractor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that a mental patient was fatally injured when a fellow patient struck him, causing the mental patient to strike his head on a concrete wall. The court noted that the action arose during the interim period between the rendering of a decision, which allowed such wrongful death suits against the state to go forward, and the imposition of a moratorium by the legislature, during which time the legislature proposed to study the problems created by the decision and to enact appropriate legislation on the subject. The court further noted that two years later, the legislature enacted 1963 Cal. Stat. 1681, &sect; 1, codified at Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 854.8, which provided that the state was immune from suits for damages to mental patients proximately caused by fellow patients. 1963 Cal. Stat. 1681, &sect; 45, subd.

Gov't Code &sect; 854.8 applied during the interim period after the decision was rendered and before the moratorium was imposed, and, therefore, the state was immune from liability in the instant action.

The court reversed, holding that &sect; 103.118 was constitutionally valid because there was a substantial basis for the city council's conclusion that a nonprofit organization could better promote the objectives and purposes of the ordinance than one that was operated for profit. There was a constitutional, natural, and intrinsic distinction between profitmaking and nonprofit organizations as sponsors of teenage dances, and the distinction bore a substantial relationship to the main objective and purpose of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the probation department could commence proceedings against juveniles without making a preliminary investigation. The court held that there was nothing in the record to indicate that juveniles' representation by their counsel was impinged upon so as to result in a deprivation of rights violative of due process. The court further held that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions since appellants committed the acts proscribed in the presence of Berkeley police officers. Finally, the court held that it could not say as a matter of law that the trial court abused its broad discretion in imposing the condition of probation since the court could not say that all reasonable minds would conclude that the subject condition was disproportionate to the offenses committed by appellants in view of the conclusion reached by the court that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a violation of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court followed the requirements in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police implemented a &quot;buy&quot; program in which an informant introduced officers to sundry narcotic sellers and arranged for sales to have been made by the persons introduced. The program lasted for approximately four months. On appeal from his conviction, defendant contended that he was denied due process of law in that there was an undue delay between the date of the offense charged and the date of his arrest. The court rejected the contention that defendant was denied any constitutional rights by reason of the fact that his case was not presented to the Grand Jury until a little over two months after it occurred. The court concluded that there was no showing that the delay was not for a valid reason nor that it prejudiced defendant. Further, the court held that the pre-arrest delay case was supported by a commendably legitimate reason. The court further rejected defendant's contention that he was unconstitutionally deprived of his right to interview and to subpoena a police informer because the informer disappeared. The court reasoned that there was no showing that prosecution was delayed in order that the informer might disappear.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and was later convicted of illegal possession of marijuana, after representing himself in court. He appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the statute was unconstitutional, the trial court erred in not advising him of his constitutional rights before permitting him to testify, and the marijuana was taken under an illegal search and seizure. The court affirmed, holding that even if the statute was unconstitutional for failing to recognize exceptions of legal possession, defendant did not show himself to be one of the class which he claimed was aggrieved. The court also held that the failure to advise defendant of his right to refrain from testifying could not be ground for attack because he volunteered to testify, and the evidence taken in the search at the hospital was justified and lawful.</SPAN></P>

The district adopted a regulation imposing limitations upon the emission of dense smoke from a number of sources, including incinerators. The regulation was applicable to apartment house incinerators, but exempt those used in one and two-family dwellings. The apartment owners unsuccessfully brought an action to have the superior court declare the regulation unconstitutional because it confiscated their property without just compensation and created an arbitrary classification. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court stated that in creating the regulation, the district was engaged in an exercise of the state's police power. As the evident purpose of the regulation was to protect the purity of the air, the court stated that the regulation was not only reasonable, but also essential and represented a lawful and proper exercise of the police power. The court found that the regulation applied equally to all multi-family housing units and all within that class were treated alike. Therefore, the regulation was not an arbitrary or unreasonable classification.</SPAN></P>

The lower court ruled in favor of plaintiff and defendant appealed on the basis that the judgment ordering the sale of the property at issue failed to protect defendant's rights under the Act. The court agreed and reversed and remanded the judgment. The court held that the procedure outlined by the lower court's order to satisfy plaintiff's judgment against the insolvent was incomplete because the lower court erred in determining the amount of defendant's lien on the property as a bona fide purchaser pursuant to Cal.

The court found that it was unnecessary to determine whether the right-to-counsel guarantees of either the United States or California Constitution were applicable to trials in military courts. Even if it were assumed that constitutional guarantees of the right to counsel applied in military trials, such guarantees were protected or satisfied when an accused before a summary court-martial was entitled to object to such summary proceeding and to be tried instead by a special or general court-martial in which the right to counsel was secured by military law. The provisions of Unif. Code Mil. Justice art. 20, 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 820, with reference to the right to object to trial by summary court-martial was applicable to members of the California Air National Guard.

Civ. Code &sect; 1812.80 et seq. (act). The Superior Court of Santa Barbara County (California) granted the preliminary injunction against the sale of lifetime dance lesson contracts, which violated the act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation argued that the record did not show that it had ever violated the provisions of the act, that is, that it did not contract directly with the dance students, but that its agents contracted directly with the students. The corporation further argued that the act was unconstitutional. The court held that the record supported the inference that the corporation continued to aid, and encouraged, the agents to violate the act. Thus, the corporation participated in the admitted statutory violations of the agents. The act was found to be constitutional because there was an adequate basis for invoking special regulations of a class of business so habitually fraught with fraud and with sharp practices. The purpose of the act was to limit the number of lessons which a studio may contract to give in any one contract. The injunction was a more effective remedy than retroactive relief in damages, and prevention was the essence of the public benefit which the act sought to protect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association filed a mandamus action seeking an injunction to compel the state to apply all civil service procedures and requirements to nonacademic employees of the state colleges. It contended that Pol. Code &sect; 362a et seq. (1921), which placed state teachers colleges and their employees under the state department of education's control, effectively made it impossible for the employees to be covered by the exception from civil service of &quot;persons employed by any state normal school or teachers college&quot; under Cal. Const. art. XXIV, &sect; 4(a)(8). It argued that this was the case because, under &sect; 362a, the nonacademic employees were defined as employees of the Director of Education, and not of the state colleges. The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice upon the state's demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed and noted that a person was generally considered employed by the institution for which he worked, and reasoned that the legislature would not have enacted the constitutional civil service exception in 1934 had it intended the particular language therein to immediately be a nullity. The court concluded that the employees thus were excepted from civil service.</SPAN></P>

It was discovered that the employee's angina was caused by his arteriosclerotic condition. The Commission found that the policeman sustained an injury to his heart arising out of his employment and, after apportionment, set the rate of permanent disability caused by the injury. The employee argued on appeal that all of his permanent disability should have been charged against the city. The court annulled the Commission's order. The court held that the Commission was not permitted to apportion the policeman's heart condition to his nonindustrial condition under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3212.5. Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4663, allowing apportionment, was inapplicable to situations covered by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3212.5. Section 3212.5 was constitutional under Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, city, building inspector, and city council, challenged the conclusions of law and writ of mandate of the Superior Court of Sonoma County (California), which ordered that a writ of mandate be issued to compel the inspector to issue a building permit to respondent property owners in their proceeding in mandamus to compel the building inspector to issue a building permit to allow construction of a trailer camp on their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court, in the form of a conclusion of law, determined that the property owners were entitled to the issuance of a writ of mandate directing the building inspector to issue a building permit for their construction of a trailer camp. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the determination of the planning commission to permit a trailer camp was not in conformance with the provisions of the city zoning ordinance and, therefore, was null and void, which gave the building inspector justification in refusing to issue the building permit for that reason. The court found that the building inspector, as a ministerial officer, could not refuse to issue a building permit unless the planning commission's determination and approval were not in conformance with the city ordinance. The court ruled that the action of the planning commission did not require the approval of the city council because the ordinance did not contain any provisions for review of the planning commission's determination that a trailer camp was a similar use as those listed in the particular zoning permit and, therefore, its decision could not be overturned by the city council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed in favor of appellants and directed the trial court to amend its conclusions of law to provide that the property owners were not entitled to a peremptory writ of mandate and to enter a judgment denying the property owners a peremptory writ of mandate and discharging the alternative writ in the property owners' proceeding in mandamus seeking a building permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner criminal appealed a judgment denying his application for a writ of prohibition barring his prosecution for violation of an obscene materials ordinance. The court affirmed the denial of the application. Petitioner was charged in an inferior court with a misdemeanor, it being alleged that he unlawfully produced an advertisement promoting the sale of obscene materials. Petitioner then sought prohibition, maintaining that the ordinance outlawing such advertisements was unconstitutional since it did not require a mental state. In petitioner's view, the ordinance's failure to mandate proof that the person charged knew the material in question was obscene was a fatal defect. In rejecting this argument, the court held that it was enough that the person charged have deliberately produced the advertisement; the person's lack of knowledge that the material was obscene was of no moment. Since the court below was correct on the law, the application for a writ of prohibition was correctly denied.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that (1) the trial court did not lose jurisdiction over defendant because of an inadvertent clerical error in its commitment order, which originally made reference to the wrong statute, and defendant suffered no prejudice from the court's action; (2) the revocation of defendant's probation and the imposition of his sentence, accomplished in defendant's absence and without a waiver of his right to be present and represented by counsel, was void but did not destroy the validity of the original probation order, because defendant's status remained the same with the imposition of his suspended sentence; and (3) because defendant's probation was reinstated on the same terms imposed when it was originally granted, his rights were not violated by his hearing absence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant oil company sought review of a decision from a trial court (California), which granted judgment for respondents, the State of California and the State of Board of Equalization, on the oil company's action seeking a refund of the taxes paid under protest which were imposed on sales of &quot;bunker&quot; fuel oil for consumption on ships engaged in foreign and interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil company filed suit against the State and the State of Board of Equalization, seeking a refund of taxes paid under protest. The oil company challenged the State's power to impose retail sales tax on the company's sales of fuel oil for consumption on ships engaged in foreign and interstate commerce. The company claimed that the tax violated the import-export clause of the constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2, and claimed immunity from state taxation under the interstate and foreign commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court affirmed the portion of the judgment denying a refund of taxes on fuel oil supplied to vessels in interstate commerce and concluded that the vessel's fuel was not itself an &quot;export&quot; and the tax did not unduly burden interstate commerce. The court reversed the judgment denying a refund of sales taxes on fuel oil supplied to vessels engaged exclusively in the export trade and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court ruled that the tax was a levy on the ocean transportation of export cargo, burdening a necessity of the voyage, and was precisely the kind of economic barrier the import-export clause was designed to prevent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying a refund of sales taxes on fuel oil supplied by the oil company to vessels engaged in interstate commerce. The court reversed the portion of the judgment denying a refund of sales taxes on fuel oil supplied to vessels engaged exclusively in the export trade, and the cause was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted he committed the offense proscribed by &sect; 507, but argued that &sect; 503 was unconstitutional. Defendant asserted that &sect; 503 authorized an unreasonable search and seizure, in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, and the Fourth Amendment to the federal Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. IV, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 503 was part of a regulatory scheme, which was essentially civil rather than criminal in nature, inasmuch as that section created a right of inspection which was limited in scope and may not be exercised under unreasonable conditions. The ordinance was thus no broader in scope than ordinances that were upheld, and defendant's constitutional objections failed.</SPAN></P>

A municipality could in the exercise of its police power enact reasonable regulations relating to the activities of those persons who engaged in door to door solicitation. Such regulations could include the requirement that the solicitor obtain a permit. It was further proper for the city to impose a nominal fee for the issuance of a license to solicitors because the license fee had a reasonable relation to the expense of investigation, issuing the license, and regulating the activities within the purview of the license.

The lower court affirmed the convictions of defendants, and the court affirmed the lower court. The court held that Cal. Lab.

The presumption of a violation could be rebutted by drawees if they showed what precautions they took to make sure that sufficient funds were in the bank account.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were jointly indicted upon conspiracy to commit assault, murder of first victim, assault upon second victim with intent to commit murder, and assault with intent to commit murder upon third victim. A jury found defendant one guilty on all four counts, fixing the homicide as second-degree murder. The jury returned verdicts finding defendant two guilty of conspiracy to commit assault, involuntary manslaughter as an included lesser offense, and simple assault upon victims two and three as included lesser offenses. New trial motions were denied and judgments pronounced. Both defendants appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that, although, as a means of testing the character witness' knowledge of reputation, the district attorney could ask the witness whether he had heard of specific acts of misconduct, he could not ask the witness whether he knew of specific acts of misconduct. The court held that conviction of second degree murder required no proof of premeditation or even of actual intent to take life. The court noted that the reversal of the conspiracy conviction thus necessitated reversal of the assault convictions.</SPAN></P>

The judgment that convicted defendant two of involuntary manslaughter, conspiracy and simple assault was reversed. The court ordered the dismissal of the conspiracy charges for both defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff optometrists petitioned in mandamus to compel defendants, California State Board of Optometry and its members (board), to issue branch office licenses to allow them to transfer branch offices that already were in existence to different locations. The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) overruled the board's demurrer and peremptory writs of mandate were granted to the optometrists. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The optometrists were duly licensed and, prior to the 1959 amendments to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 3077 (1955) (amended 1959), operated several branches throughout the San Francisco area. Prior to 1959, although the optometrists had to obtain licenses for each branch office, there was no limitation on the number of such branches. After the 1959 amendments, &sect; 3077(f) limited to one the number of branch office licenses that would be issued to an optometrist or two or more optometrists jointly. However, &sect; 3077(i) provided a grandfather clause to then-existing branches, with that privilege terminating upon the sale of the branch office. The board argued that the transfer of branch offices would constitute a sale. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1085 was applicable as the judicial relief sought was the issuance of a judicial writ, not an appeal from the board's findings and, thus, the optometrists' appeal was timely; and (2) a transfer of the branches would not constitute a sale as &sect; 3077(i) gave protection not to the specifically located branches, but to the number of branch offices operated by an optometrist prior to the 1959 amendment's effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grant of peremptory writs of mandate to the optometrists that compelled the board to issue licenses to the optometrists for the transfer of their branch offices to different locations.</SPAN></P>

Following the trial court's declaration of a resulting trust, the claimant appealed. The court affirmed. Pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 853, the payment of the purchase price by the claimant's deceased father and the taking of title in the name of the attorney gave rise to a presumption that the attorney held the title in trust for the decedent. The evidence clearly supported the trial court's finding that the claimant and his brother received title to the property without consideration, with knowledge of the existence of the trust in favor of the decedent and his heirs, and subject to that trust. The conditions no longer prevailed, which evoked the declaration that the presumption of &sect; 853 did not apply where property was purchased by an alien ineligible to hold it. The court concluded that knowledge of grave injustices done under the guise of the Alien Land Act led to the conclusion that the trial court did not err in finding a resulting trust in favor of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the grant of the motion for nonsuit and held that the conclusion was inescapable that no tangible benefit served as the principal inducement for the driver furnishing the guest a ride. There was no contention that there was either wilful misconduct or intoxication for an exception to &sect; 17158. The purpose of the evening was purely social in nature and the benefit conferred was not for the ride but for the pleasure of the driver's company during the evening's festivities and in the guest's hope that she could in some way relieve the driver of her worries, which did not constitute compensation within the meaning of &sect; 17158.

The city ordinance was subsequently determined to be unconstitutional and the criminal complaint under which the former defendant had been charged failed to allege the commission of a public offense and so he was released and all proceedings were discharged against him. The former defendant filed a petition for the return of his money and exhibits which were introduced into evidence during his trial and the trial court denied his petition. The former defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the return of his items. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the former defendant's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the return of his items, holding that he did not suggest any reason why a civil action was not an adequate remedy for his purposes and that the extraordinary proceeding by mandamus was not available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insured challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which, in respondent insurer's action for declaratory relief and for an injunction to restrain the insured from proceeding under the uninsured motorist statute with an arbitration hearing on her claim for damages for injuries allegedly sustained, held in favor of the insurer and found that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On April 4, 1960, while driving a vehicle covered by the insurer's policy, the insured was injured; the driver of the other vehicle involved was unknown. Within 30 days, the insured filed a statement with the insurer concerning the accident, as required by the policy relating to uninsured motorist coverage. On July 17, 1963, the insured demanded damages for bodily injuries and demanded arbitration. Following the demand, the instant action was commenced. The court affirmed. Prior to Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 11580.2(h) (effective September 15, 1961), the uninsured motorist statute embodied no period of limitations governing causes of action accruing thereunder so that general statutes limiting the filing of actions were applicable. However, &sect; 11580.2(h) imposed a one-year period of limitations. The court held that &sect; 11580.2(h) could not be applied retrospectively to cut off the insured's claim; however, even by a prospective application beginning on September 15, 1961, the insured was beyond the one-year period of limitations. The court held that one-year was a reasonable time for the insured to have brought the action, and her failure to do so barred her claim.</SPAN></P>

Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect;&sect; 1800 through 1803.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor was committed to the youth authority when he was 14 years of age. A physician that examined the minor concluded that he was a dangerous person and able to kill someone. Later examinations by various psychiatrists confirmed this evaluation. During his detention, the minor was paroled three times, and each time his parole was revoked because of failure to adjust in society. The control of the youth authority over the minor would ordinarily have ceased upon the minor's 21st birthday, but as that date approached it appeared that the minor was not prepared to make any successful adjustment outside of some correctional facility. The youth authority then sought to continue the minor's detention. On appeal, the minor contended that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to issue the order extending the minor's detention because the youth authority did not comply with procedural requirements concerning the filing of the petition. The court held that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect; 1800, which required that a petition be filed at least 90 days before the date of discharge did not purport to restrict the trial court's power to act. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant neighboring businessman challenged, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 46, 48a, a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which ruled that appellant had uttered slander against respondent automobile business owner as an intruder on a live television broadcast. A jury assessed compensatory and punitive damages against appellant. The matter came before the court on a settled statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court asserted that this case was not a proper one for drawing sweeping parallels between persons whom Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 48a protected in the newspaper business and those covered in television. The court found no request for a ruling at the trial that gave appellant neighboring businessman the benefit of &sect; 48a if he was unaware that he was publishing his remarks through television. The court found that the jury believed respondent automobile business owner's witnesses. The court asserted that the amount of punitive damages awarded showed that the jury did not believe appellant, even though it was instructed to consider provocation, mistake, or ignorance of facts or other circumstances that might mitigate appellant's culpability. The court held that &sect; 48a did not protect an intruder and concluded that if by innuendo and inducement his words were susceptible of a defamatory meaning pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 46(3), no special damages had to be pleaded or proved. The court asserted that the jury found that appellant's remarks imputed to respondent a general disqualification in aspects that his occupation peculiarly required, such as fair dealing. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment favoring respondent automobile business owner. Appellant neighboring businessman was an intruder and was not covered by the statute, and no special damages had to be pleaded or proved. Appellant's remarks generally disqualified respondent in the area of fair dealing and were slanderous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, political group and related individuals (group), sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted judgment in favor of defendant government officials in the group's action seeking an injunction and a declaration that certain sections of the Truth in Endorsements Law (Law), Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Law provided that every advertisement that made reference to any candidate for nomination for partisan office in a direct primary and contained a statement to the effect that the candidate had been endorsed by an organization using as a part of its name the name of a political party, was to bear a notice that the organization was an unofficial political group. The group was a group of volunteer, unpaid party members not acting in any official party capacity and did not want to comply with the Law's notice requirements. The court determined that the Law was constitutional. Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 2 1/2 expressly empowered the legislature to establish tests governing the rights of political parties to participate in primary elections. The Law served to attain the legitimate objective of requiring that all party nominations be made directly by members of the party at a primary election. Furthermore, Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 8601(4) provided that the voting public was entitled to protection by law from deception in political campaigns. The Law did not curtail the right to endorse any candidate, it merely required that the use of a name of a political party not mislead the voters.</SPAN></P>

XI, &sect; 6 may have required a vote by the electorate to enter into the contract, Proposition 11 eliminated that requirement and retroactively validated such contracts. The ordinance did not violate Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 45007 by the elimination of city officials' duties to collect taxes because Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 51506 allowed for the transfer of those duties. The electorate did not have the power to determine the structure of the city government because the city was a general law city and, thus, was a creature of the state, which controlled its structure. The taxpayer had his right to vote on whether the city could have transferred its tax collection powers to the county in the statewide election of Proposition 11.

Granting summary judgment under California law was permissible in a FELA case; there was no incompatibility between the state summary judgment procedure and FELA. The employee did not have a cause of action under FELA because his employer was not a common carrier. The business of renting refrigeration cars and providing protective services was not the operation of a railroad as a means of carrying the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that prohibition was a proper remedy because the possible denial of due process would have been an act in excess of jurisdiction and the constitutional application of a statute was being attacked. The court interpreted Cal. Penal Code &sect; 270e to provide that a prima facie showing of paternity could have been made by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that the proper application of &sect; 270e required that if a showing of paternity appeared by a preponderance of the evidence defendant need merely to have gone forward with evidence to the extent of raising a reasonable doubt that he was the father. The court held that the trial court erred holding that the issue of paternity had to have been taken from the jury because the trial court determined that the judgment in the divorce action was res judicata of the issue of paternity. The court held that the interlocutory decree of divorce was admissible as evidence, but the issue of paternity had to be given the jury. The court held that defendant had been given an opportunity to meet the evidence and presumptions and in order to find him guilty the jury was required to find him so beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the commissioner had the power to decide the matter pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 259a.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which found in favor of plaintiff property owners in their action seeking to have the formation of an assessment district declared void and to enjoin the city and its agents from collecting any assessments under the district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted a resolution to widen and improve a certain road and to create an assessment district to bear the cost of the resolution. The property owners filed protests, which were overruled by the city. The assessment district was formally inaugurated, and all of the property owners and non-party property owners within the district were ordered to pay assessments. The property owners filed suit challenging the creation of the district, and the trial court found in their favor. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by declaring the road project to be an improvement of city-wide benefit and that no special benefit was conferred upon the land within the district. The court reasoned that the trial court lacked authority to reweigh the evidence and to make its own findings on matters that the city was authorized to decide. The trial court also erred by declaring the entire district void and ordering the reimbursement of assessments paid by owners who were not parties to the action and not subject to the statute of limitations of Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 10400. Therefore, only the assessments levied against the party property owners were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court judgment and directed the trial court to modify the judgment in accordance with the court's decision. The modified judgment was to provide, inter alia, that the assessment district was valid and that the assessments were invalid only as to the property owners who were plaintiffs in the action. The court further directed the trial court to remand the case to the city for reassessment proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The former husband never complied with a child support order, and the mother received county aid. The mother was advised of stepfather liability procedures. The court found that county aid continued after the marriage because the mother and stepfather misrepresented his income. The mother and stepfather contended that the budgeting formula used to calculate eligibility for aid was invalid. The court found that the &quot;stepfather liability&quot; arrived at in any given month was never in excess of the mother's community property interest in the stepfather's income. The budgeting formula merely took the stepfather's income into consideration in determining the needs of his stepchildren. It neither deprived him of his income nor required him to support the children beyond the mother's community property interest in his income. The mother admitted that she knew the stepfather worked more hours than were indicated by the wage stubs that she reported. She admitted that she was required to report all his income. No other evidence was needed to support a finding of knowing misrepresentation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lounge operator brought an action in the superior court that challenged city gambling ordinances. The lounger operator alleged that there were various constitutional challenges to gambling ordinances pending before the California Supreme Court and requested that the city be enjoined from enforcing the ordinances, claiming that it had no adequate remedy at law because the Supreme Court had not issued its own decision. After the superior court signaled its intent to issue a temporary injunction against the city, the city applied to the court for a writ of prohibition that would compel the superior court from issuing the injunction. Prior to the court's decision on the city's application, the Superior Court handed down a decision that rejected the general contention that municipal gambling ordinances were invalid.

A preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the order was entered pending the resolution of the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the director issued an order that required that milk sold at a distributor's processing plant be four cents per gallon lower than the minimum retail store carry-out price, the retail grocers brought an action challenging the order as arbitrary and capricious. The complaint alleged that the new minimum prices were promulgated in violation of the applicable statutes without consideration of the relevant cost factors, were based on insufficient evidence, and were contrary to proper procedures. The trial court below found that there was substantial evidence in support of the minimum prices set by the order. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, in light of the evidence presented at the hearing, the facts known to the director, and the director's duties under the Milk Stabilization Act, he could properly conclude that the combination of the elimination of the quantity discount together with the various price reductions ordered would not unduly harm the retail grocers, would encourage the orderly and efficient marketing of milk as to all methods of distribution, and would satisfy the statutory mandate of making milk available at the lowest price to consumers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainants' cause of action against the state was based upon an alleged dangerous and defective condition of a highway. A moratorium legislation froze all pending litigation in which the doctrine of governmental immunity was an issue. After the development of the law of governmental tort liability, the State's demurrer was sustained because the complaint did not properly state a cause of action under the new law. The issues on appeal were: (1) whether the new legislation violated due process and equal protection, whether applied prospectively or retrospectively; (2) whether it was constitutional; (3) whether the complaint stated a cause of action under the new legislation; and (4) if not, could it have been amended to state one? After review, this court concluded that the legislation was constitutional; the complaint, although inadequately framed, could be amended to state a cause of action under the new legislation and under the common law of tort liability sans governmental immunity. The trial court erred prejudicially in sustaining the State's demurrer.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments convicting defendants, except to the extent of reversing certain sentences imposed, concluding that defendants could not urge that they did not know how many other kinds of executives could also be protected under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the complaint had failed to charge a public offense or at most charged a misdemeanor and that he had been deprived of a substantial right because the trial court did not rule on his probation motion. The complaint alleged that defendant did knowingly and with intent to defraud use for the purpose of obtaining goods a credit card stolen from the possession of a cardholder, the value of such goods exceeding $ 50. The court rejected defendant's first claim, holding that &sect; 484a(b)(6) did not require that the credit card be stolen by the person charged or that it be stolen in California. It was sufficient if defendant knowingly had wrongful possession and used the card for the purposes indicated in the statute. If the complaint was ambiguous in charging that defendant actually obtained over $ 50 worth of goods, the ambiguity should have been raised in the trial court and could not be considered on appeal. Further, defendant was not deprived of a substantial right when the trial court failed to rule on his probation motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner alleged that it was denied a fair hearing before the city council and that the protest statute,&nbsp;Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35313, was unconstitutional as applied to the disputed facts. On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's judgment. The property owner was not denied a fair hearing because the city council complied with &sect; 35313 by determining that the protestors accounted for less than half of the total assessed value of the land to be annexed. The protestors owned only 8.07 percent of the value of the land to be annexed, and there was no evidence that the city council acted impartially. Application of &sect; 35313 was not unconstitutional because the annexation did not operate as a taking without due process, as alleged by the property owner. Annexation proceedings were not based on a city's police power, which was restricted to the city's limits. The legislature derived authority to provide for annexation from Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 6, and the mode adopted was, therefore, a question of policy and expediency. Because no one had a vested right to be included or excluded from a local governmental unit, the annexation did not invade any constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that both Cal. Veh.

The criticism of &sect; 23101 was that it referred to &quot;any act forbidden by law in the driving of a vehicle.&quot; Defendant argued that &sect; 23101 was defective in that it failed to specify the acts which were forbidden. The court found that it could not say that the trial court could not reasonably have inferred that defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor within the meaning of &sect; 23101. The information charged the offense in the words of &sect; 23101, thus complying with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 952. The language in &sect; 23101 did not have a variety of meanings in common usage and it did not lack precision. Every operator of a motor vehicle was required to know what acts were forbidden by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner filed an application pursuant to &sect; 1011 in the trial court for an order appointing a conservator in light of the condition of respondents, an insurer and its underwriter. On appeal, the commissioner argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award attorneys' fees, expenses, or costs from the insurer and its underwriter's assets in a conservator proceeding. The commissioner contended that a &sect; 1011 proceeding was a special proceeding, the court having only those powers that were expressly granted to it by statute. The court disagreed, and affirmed. The court held that once the commissioner assumed the duty of appointing a conservator, he was subject to the jurisdiction of the court to the same extent as were all receivers of corporations. The court found that to hold that the trial court lacked jurisdiction would have been to countenance a de facto deprivation of property without due process of law. The court found that the fact that the commissioner's position was ultimately sustained did not mean that the insurer's attempt to defend was in bad faith. The court denied the commissioner's request to augment the record by inclusion of subsequent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, ruling that the ordinance was a valid and lawful exercise of the police power. It held that the municipal ordinance was constitutional. The exceptions permitted under the ordinance were reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Permitting a name or identification sign of limited size applied equally to all. Permitting the property owner to erect a sign of limited size advertising the leasing, rental, or sale of the property was proper so as not to unduly restrict the renting or sale of property. The prohibition against &quot;for rent&quot; or &quot;for sale&quot; signs by real estate brokers, with the name of their realty companies was a reasonable restriction regulating advertising. Whether or not such incidental commercial advertising merited the signs' exclusion, was for the sound discretion of the legislative body and not the reviewing court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed a judgment in favor of the police officers under a municipal ordinance that required suits against police officers to be filed pursuant to a specified claim procedure. Plaintiff sought recovery for damages based on the police officers' alleged false imprisonment, battery, and assault. The court observed that although the complaint did not allege that the police officers were engaged in the course of their employment, he did stipulate during pretrial that the police officers were &quot;duly appointed officers&quot; and such stipulation superseded the issues raised by the pleadings. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the lower court properly concluded that plaintiff's failure to comply with the city ordinance's condition precedent to the filing of the action was fatal to the maintenance of the action. The court rejected plaintiff's claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the state had preempted the field. The court reasoned that the absence of state preemption was demonstrated by the fact that the existing jurisdiction of cities to govern matters by charter with regard to claims against public employees was recognized in Cal.

The court found that under &sect; 400, the act of exhibiting a deformity was not immoral, or injurious to the health of the people, or against the public welfare. The prohibition was to anyone making a financial transaction out of the exhibiting of the deformity. The court held that the financial transaction was not immoral, dangerous to general health, or against public welfare of the people. While the reasonable objective of the statute upon its enactment may have been a valid exercise of the police power because of the changed conditions during the intervening 91 years there was no reasonable objective to be reached by the statute. That there might be regulation of exhibits of abnormalities was not questioned, but the court concluded that the prohibition of them was an improper exercise of the police power of the state when superimposed upon public morals and welfare of the present era.</SPAN></P>

It found that the only expressed constitutional duty of the Board was to equalize the valuation of taxable property in the counties of the state and that neither the duty nor the Board's power to increase or lower the assessment roll so as to equalize the assessment and make it conform to the true value of the property contained in the roll was set in terms of equalizing at 100 percent of market value. Further, Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 9, was intended to permit the Board to equalize on the basis of fractional assessments to full cash value because, if it was intended that all property was to be assessed at 100 percent of market value, the Board would not need the power to make the rolls or assessments conform to cash value as it would be bound by the 100 percent requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant electrical contractor challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied his application for a writ of mandate to nullify respondent Contractors' State License Board's order that denied him a contractor's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractor filed his license application on March 14, 1963, and the registrar of contractors (registrar) adopted the proposed order of the hearing officer on April 17, 1963, and the decision to deny the contractor's request became effective on May 14, 1963. The contractor received the decision on May 6, 1963, and he wrote the office of administrative procedure requesting the cost of a transcript from the hearing. After receiving a cost estimate and paying the fee, the contractor received the completed record on June 18, 1963. The contractor's application was filed on July 2, 1963 after the clerk initially rejected it. On August 5, 1963, a return was made to the writ and the affirmative defense of the time limitations for filing the application for the writ was pleaded. The registrar argued that the contractor's application for writ of mandate expired on June 13, 1963, 30 days after the order became effective. The court found that under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11523, because the contractor received the registrar's decision on May 6 he had until July 5 to file his application for writ of mandate. The contractor was not required to seek reconsideration under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11521.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the denial of the contractor's application for writ of mandate. The case was remanded for trial on issues other than the timeliness of the contractor's application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent individual had filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. He argued that the Governor's warrant, pursuant to which he was arrested and the papers accompanying the same, affirmatively indicated on their face that there had been no compliance with the requirements of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1661. After a hearing on the matter, the petition was granted. The primary issue on appeal was whether &sect; 1661(b) created a mandatory condition precedent before the Governor of California could honor a request for extradition of a person, not a &quot;fugitive&quot; within the meaning of U.S. Const. art. IV, for his failure to support dependents in the demanding state. The court believed it did. The court held that the provision in Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1661(b), requiring the Governor to call upon any prosecutor to investigate the demand for extradition, was a mandatory condition precedent before the Governor could decide to honor the request for extradition. Absent compliance with the requirement of &sect; 1661(b), the Governor was without jurisdiction to issue a warrant for a nonfugitive on a nonsupport charge. The warrant was void and afforded no authority for detention of the individual.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that it could and affirmed the judgment. The court analyzed pertinent statutes and constitutional provisions. Although Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12 and Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 401 specifically stated that property was to be assessed at its full cash value, the court ruled that the administrative construction resulting in the assessment of taxable property by a county at a uniform fraction of its full cash value was not erroneous or unauthorized. The practice of assessing at a uniform fraction of full cash value on a standard of full cash value had been consistently followed since 1872 with the knowledge and permission of both the California Legislature and the courts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the demurer and subsequently entered a take nothing judgment against plaintiffs. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that plaintiffs' claims seeking declaratory relief were not barred by the statute of limitations where defendant was equitably estopped from asserting the defense of limitation because city officials had misled plaintiffs as to their pension rights. The court noted the officials that had misled plaintiffs stood in confidential relationships to plaintiffs and had asserted that they were fully informed of the law. The court determined the charter amendment was invalid as applied to plaintiffs because it imposed burdensome limitations upon pension rights that were unaccompanied by compensating benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the provisions of &sect; 7113.5 vesting in the registrar the authority to consider acts of bankruptcy as a cause of disciplinary action, which action could extend to the revocation of a license, was a valid exercise of the state's police power and was not in conflict with the federal Bankruptcy Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action for damages for breach of an express oral promise to live with and support plaintiff, for fraudulently making promises to live with and support her without any intention of fulfilling these promises and for negligently marrying her or negligently leaving her without reasonable care as to her support.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wife brought an action against defendant husband for breach of an express oral promise to live with and support her, for fraudulently making promises to live with and support her without intention of fulfilling the promise, and for negligently leaving her without reasonable care as to her support. The Superior Court of Plumas County (California) sustained the husband's general demurrer, and the wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband contended that his wife's claims were barred under Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 43.4, 43.5. The court found that the occurrence of a marriage ceremony did not affect the operation of the &sect;&sect; 43.4 and 43.5, as the breach occurred whether by postnuptial or antenuptial renunciation. The court found that the legislature's amendment to the law made the provision of the statutes that barred this sort of action apply to postnuptial breaches. The court found that breach of promise actions were aimed at financial vindication of the entire group of marital expectations and commitments and frustrated economic expectations that did not escape &sect; 43.5. The court found that the wife had available alternative remedies to recoup her loss and to allow recovery could permit her to receive duplicate recoveries. Thus, the wife's claim of special damages was barred under &sect; 43.5(d). As to the claim of fraud in promising to live with and support the wife, the court found that its objective was an action for damages, not restitution and fell under &sect; 43.4. The negligence claim likewise fell under the statute because it was a transparent pleading device to circumvent a statutory barrier.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the property owners were without standing to challenge the validity of the ordinance until they exhausted the administrative remedy available to them.

The court held that one prostitute was not an accomplice and therefore, her testimony was properly corroborating. The jury instructions were proper, clear, consistent with the criminal statutes, and not misleading. There was also sufficient proof of the pandering conviction because defendant not only rented rooms to prostitutes, but he and his business associate procured women to live at the hotel as prostitutes. A witness' testimony was admissible though she had changed her testimony to an unsworn statement because she thought that defendant had attempted to frame her for crimes that she did not commit. The unsworn statement did not have to be accepted as fact. Due to a lack of objection and prejudice, the jury instructions were proper.

The court held that the bar owner's premises was a bona fide public eating place and, unless good cause, other than proximity or student patronage, existed, it could not be contended that such premise was not entitled to be licensed. The court ruled that Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22(5) gave the department the exclusive power to license except as provided and in accordance with laws enacted by the legislature. The court found that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 172, the legislature removed restrictions imposed on bona fide public eating places.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a participating carrier involved in the interstate shipment of goods under a division agreement, paid a motor vehicle transportation tax, exhausted his administrative remedies, and instituted an action to recover the taxes. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) entered judgment for defendant, the State Board of Equalization (California). The carrier appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the division agreement, participating carriers shipped goods origin-to-destination as single through shipments but physically handled shipments as &quot;joint through movement&quot; by two or more carriers acting under an &quot;interline&quot; arrangement. Carriers operating under the division agreement received a greater proportion of the total freight charges than that which a mileage proration would have produced because they incurred extra costs for handling. The Board treated the full amount of the carrier's proportion of the freight charges as &quot;gross receipts&quot; under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 9606 and did not apply a mileage proration. On appeal from the Board's judgment, the court held that the carrier was not entitled to a refund because the taxing of &quot;transportation operations&quot; under &sect; 9606 included any and all activities that contributed to an origin-to-destination movement. Because all of the carrier's mileage was in California, the Board treated as &quot;gross receipts&quot; all of the compensation that was allocated to the carrier. The carrier was not exempt from taxation under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 9653(b) because none of its shipments remained entirely within any incorporated city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed a referendum petition with the city clerk. The city clerk refused to certify the petition because it failed to comply with the signature requirements of 1911 Cal. Stat. &sect; 143, which required that the petition be signed by at least 20 percent of the total number of registered voters. The taxpayer filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the city council to call an election. The court denied the petition, holding that &sect; 143 was not subordinated to Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, and art. XI, &sect;&sect; 6, 8. Article IV, &sect; 1, provided that not more than 15 percent of the electors were needed to propose any initiative measure, and that not more than 10 percent were needed for the referendum. The court construed the language of art. IV, &sect; 1, as not curtailing the powers of those cities having charters. However, art. IV, &sect; 1, placed a restriction on the city to refrain from withholding the initiative and referendum powers reserved by the constitution. The court held that the limitation did not extend to include the provisions concerning the percentage of voters required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California) that set aside an indictment against defendants under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 on the ground that defendants were indicted without reasonable or probable cause. Defendants were charged under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182 with conspiracy to write, publish, or distribute obscene materials in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A writ was granted directing the superior court to return all of the defendants' seized property except two books which had been specifically named in the affidavit for an allegedly invalid search warrant and in the warrant itself. The majority of the exhibits which were before the grand jury were withdrawn, and the superior court set aside the indictment. The court examined the remaining evidence received by the grand jury to determine whether it was sufficient to establish reasonable cause to warrant the return of the indictment. The court reversed the superior court's order, ruling that the grand jury had before it sufficient competent evidence to support the charge of conspiracy against all defendants. There was probable cause to determine that defendants knew the contents of the books and realized that such material could reasonably be regarded as obscene, establishing scienter under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311. The evidence presented to the grand jury justified the belief that the book deliveries were made at approximately the times alleged, and certainly within the three-year period of limitations.</SPAN></P>
