</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the orders from the Division of Administrative Hearings and Administration Commission (Florida), which held that the sanction policies authorized under the Growth Management Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3161-163.3243 (1985), were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two local governments, failed to submit their growth management plans on time in violation of the Growth Management Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3161-163.3243. As a result, sanctions were imposed and the municipalities were denied Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57 hearings. Appellants sought a ruling that the sanction policies were invalid and that Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3184(11) constituted an illegal delegation of power. The sanctions, and the statutory provision, Fla. Stat. ch. 163.3184(11), upon which they were based, were upheld against appellants' unlawful delegation argument. The court held that the commission, through a Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57 hearing process, could validly apply the incipient policy to appellants. However, the court remanded the case to provide appellants with an opportunity to challenge the underlying basis of nonsubmission in a formal hearing. The notice of agency action did not inform appellants of their right to request a hearing, and the time limit for doing so was inadequate to trigger the commencement of the administrative process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, which held the sanctions and the statutory provision upon which they were based were a lawful delegation of authority. However, the case was remanded back to the commission to provide appellants an opportunity to challenge their failure to timely submit their plans in a formal administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee drove a ready-mix concrete truck. While on site, a contractor told appellee to clean the truck by removing any remaining concrete in the truck's chute. Appellee removed the concrete onto the sidewalk. An officer ordered appellee to clean up the concrete. Appellee was charged with littering, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 403.413(4)(a). Appellee moved to dismiss alleging that the statute was unconstitutional and that the facts did not establish a prima facie case of guilt under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4). The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded for further proceedings. The trial court incorrectly declared the statute unconstitutional before it addressed appellee's motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4). If the action against appellee could be dismissed under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4), then the trial court could have avoided declaring the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the trial court should have first considered appellee's motion to dismiss, which alleged that the facts did not establish his guilt, before it declared the littering statute unconstitutional. The court concluded that the action could have been disposed of without addressing the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, faculty organization and its president, sought review of an order from appellee Florida Public Employees Relations Commission, which found that appellants had engaged in an unfair labor practice, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 447.501(2)(f) (1987), by publishing an open letter to the students of the Florida International University student newspaper soliciting their support in connection with an ongoing labor dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed the administrative order finding that appellants, faculty organization and its president, had engaged in an unfair labor practice. The appellate court determined that the statute appellants had been found to have violated, Fla. Stat. ch. 447.501(2)(f) (1987), was facially unconstitutional as an unreasonable restriction on appellants' U.S. Const. amend. I right to free speech. The appellate court found that because Fla. Stat. ch. 447.501(2)(f) was both a content-based and viewpoint-based restriction on speech that regulated speech based upon the identity of the speaker, it was only sustainable if the speech restrictions served a compelling state interest and the statute was narrowly drawn to achieve that end. The appellate court then noted that while the statute's stated purposes might have qualified as compelling state interests, Fla. Stat. ch. 447.501(2)(f) was not so narrowly tailored to achieve those interests. The appellate court remanded with directions to dismiss the charges against appellants, concluding that the statute was too broadly drawn to meet constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the unfair labor practices charges against appellants, faculty organization and its president; although the charging statute's stated purposes might have served compelling state interests, the statutory restrictions on appellants' expressive conduct in soliciting student support for their activities were unconstitutional because they were not narrowly tailored to achieve those interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant personal representative brought a products liability action against appellee manufacturers. The trial court held that the statute of repose, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1985), barred appellant's cause of action and entered summary judgment in favor of appellees. Because the period for bringing a products liability cause of action expired during the time that the statute of repose was in effect, the court held that appellant's cause of action was barred even though a new statute of limitation existed when the action accrued. Appellant moved for a rehearing and certification for the limited purpose of certifying a question to be of great public importance and to certify that the appellate court's opinion was in direct conflict with another appellate court. The court granted appellant's motion and certified the following question to the supreme court: Did the repealed statute of repose, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1985), give a manufacturer or a deliverer of the completed product a vested right not to be sued for an accident that occurred after the date of repeal?</SPAN></P>

Appellant was declared indigent for the purposes of appeal and the public defendant was appointed to represent him. Appellant's argument centered on an error in sentencing. The public defender's office moved to withdraw and filed an Anders brief in support of its motion. The appellate court notified the prosecution and appellant about the Anders brief and sua sponte requested that the prosecution and the public defender address the issue of whether a transcript of the proceeding had to be included in the record. The public defender then filed a motion to supplement the record with a full transcript of the trial. The prosecution contended that a transcript was not required. The court granted to motion to supplement the record and held that appellant was entitled to a transcript because a full verbatim record was necessary to assure that appellant had as effective an appeal as would have been available to a defendant with resources to pay his own way.</SPAN></P>

The officer knew that it was a violation of Sarasota County, Fla., Ordinance 87-41 (1987), which was punishable as a misdemeanor pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 125.69 (1987).When the officer opened appellee's door, the officer observed a bag of marijuana. Appellee's motion to suppress the evidence of drugs was granted on the grounds that the county ordinance had been superseded by a state statute. The court found that a statewide open container law was enacted which made an open container violation a noncriminal moving traffic violation. Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1936(6) (1988). The court found that the local ordinance conflicted with state law and was superseded by the noncriminal state sanction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state filed a writ of certiorari requesting a review of an order by the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida), reversing an order to suspend respondent's driver's license and finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.2615 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was arrested for driving under the influence, and his driver's license was suspended pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.2615 because he refused to submit to a blood alcohol level breath test. On appeal, the lower court found ch. 322.2615 unconstitutional for non-Florida residents because it denied them access to the courts, due process, and equal protection. The lower court ordered respondent's driver's license returned. On appeal, the court granted petitioner's writ of certiorari, quashed the order, and remanded the case. The court held that the lower court had jurisdiction to review administrative action under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(b), Fla. R. App. P. 9.030(c)(1)(C), and Fla. Stat. ch. 322.31. The court found ch. 322.31 did not limit the lower court's jurisdiction to Florida residents, and it was improper to hold otherwise. The court ruled that ch. 322.31 failed to provide a specific venue for nonresidents, but respondent voluntarily submitted himself to the lower court's venue, and petitioner agreed. The court held that under both the un-amended and amended ch. 322.21, review of violations occurred in the county where the informal review was conducted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order reversing the suspension of respondent's driver's license and the finding that the statute was unconstitutional for nonresidents was overturned because the lower court had jurisdiction and venue to review administrative action and because respondent had voluntarily submitted himself to the lower court's venue. The court noted that venue for reviewing violations was in the county where the informal review occurred.</SPAN></P>

Adm. Code Ann. r. 10D-42.023 and compliance with Fla. Stat. ch.  316.1932(1)(f) and Fla. Stat. ch. 120.50 in the context of appellant's prosecution of appellee for D.U.I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Just prior to appellee's jury trial on the charge of driving under the influence, the trial court heard argument on appellee's motion to suppress the results of a breathalyzer test taken shortly after appellee's arrest. Fla. Adm. Code Ann. r. 10D-42.023 required that test instruments be checked yearly for accuracy and reproducibility. The trial court found Fla. Adm. Code Ann. r. 10D-42.023, governing the monthly checks on that machine, was constitutionally valid because it incorporated a specified form which further defined what was meant by accuracy and reproducibility. The annual check rule incorporated no specified form, and the machine involved was checked pursuant to a revised version of that form. Appellant state conceded rule 10D-42.022(3)(b), which contained a very stringent definition of accuracy, did not apply to the annual or monthly checks and the checks made on the machine in this case came nowhere near that rule's requirements. The court found that the rule adopted for annual checks was unconstitutionally vague, and that appellant failed to prove that any deviation in the procedure used by the two forms used for monthly checks was insubstantial or unimportant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling excluding admission of appellee's blood alcohol test, found that rule adopted for annual checks was unconstitutionally vague, and answered the certified questions accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an employer and its insurance carrier, sought review of an order of the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida), which ruled that the limitation period under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.28 (1977) was not applicable to bar appellee employee's application for temporary total disability benefits following a work-related injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an employer and its insurance carrier, argued the compensation judge erred in not applying the two-year limitation period of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.28 (1977) to bar appellee claimant's claim for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits following a work-related injury in 1979 and related surgery in 1988. Specifically, appellants contended that because appellee's maximum medical improvement (MMI) was recognized in a 1980 order, appellee could not obtain TTD benefits in 1988 without seeking modification of the 1980 order pursuant to ch. 440.28, which barred appellee's modification claim because the limitations period had expired. The court agreed, but remanded for determination of whether intervening circumstances prevented application of the statutory bar. Explaining, the court ruled that the judge's award of TTD benefits was inconsistent with the 1980 order establishing that appellee had reached MMI. Thus, only by modification of that award, on statutory grounds, could appellee claim TTD benefits. But whether parties' conduct since the 1980 order affected the character of appellants' compensation payments so as to waive the limitations defense must be considered on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order ruling that statutory limitation period was not applicable to bar appellee's application for temporary total disability benefits following 1979 work injury and 1988 surgery reversed, as claim was time-barred for not being filed within two years of appellee's receipt from appellants of final permanent partial disability payment, but order was remanded to determine if parties' conduct since original order effectively waived limitation period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, condominium association and mortgagee, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida) that denied them class certification under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, condominium association and mortgagee, filed an action against various county officials to contest tax assessments against their condominium units. Holding that the complaint alleged a common interest as to members of plaintiff condominium association, the court reversed the order to the extent it denied them class certification pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.221. The court noted that this class certification was appropriate because the complaint alleged overvaluation of all condominium units due to an aberration in the assessment process, a matter which was of common interest to all unit owners. The court held that the unit owners were not indispensable parties in light of Fla. Stat. ch. 194.181(1)(a) (1987), which permitted actions of this sort to be maintained by an association. The court then held that plaintiff mortgagee was not a proper class representative under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220. The court explained that plaintiff mortgagee's interest was unique, not representative, and noted that other litigation between plaintiff mortgagee and many unit owners demonstrated some adverse interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded with directions to certify the unit owners as a class with plaintiff condominium association serving as class representative. The court held that plaintiff mortgagee was not a proper class representative because its interest was unique, and it had an adverse interest to some of the unit owners by virtue of other litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, which sought to replevin furniture it had leased because the required rental payments had not been made, petitioned for review of the denial by the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) of appellant's petition for a writ of mandamus to require appellee, the county court judge, to perform the duty to issue a writ of replevin without notice under Fla. Stat. ch. 78.068 (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought to replevin furniture it had leased because the required rental payments had not been made. Although appellant's papers fully complied with the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 78.068 (1989), including a verified allegation that the lessee failed to make payment as agreed under Fla. Stat. ch. 78.068(2) and the bond required by Fla. Stat. ch. 78.068(3), appellee, the county court judge, declined to issue the writ. Instead, he ordered appellant to submit an order setting the application for subsequent hearing after notice to the lessee. Appellant filed a petition for writ of mandamus to require appellee to issue the writ of replevin. The circuit court dismissed the application, holding that the issuance of the writ of replevin was only a discretionary act to which mandamus would not lie. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded for the issuance of a writ of mandamus. The court held that the issuance of the writ of replevin by the trial court under Fla. Stat. ch. 78.068 was mandatory or ministerial in nature and that mandamus must in this case be issued in order to require the performance of that duty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a franchise automotive dealership, sought review of two decisions of appellee Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (Florida), which dismissed its petitions for formal proceedings due to its lack of standing. Appellant claimed that it was entitled to standing under Fla. Stat. chs. 320.642, 320.699, 320.6992 and 120.57 (Supp. 1988).</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged that appellee dealers had failed to meet their burden of showing that the dealerships had an inadequate representation in the local market. Appellee department of highway safety and motor vehicles granted appellee dealers' motion to dismiss, holding that Fla.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, holding that appellee department's interpretation of ch. 320.642(3)(b) was proper because the statute clearly gave standing only to those within the specified geographical areas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Santa Rosa County Circuit Court (Florida), convicting and sentencing him for grand theft of a firearm, grand theft, and burglary of a building while armed. Defendant claimed, among other issues, that the trial court erred in concluding that the habitual felony offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4)(a) (Supp. 1988), required a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of grand theft of a firearm, grand theft, and burglary of a dwelling while armed, and was sentenced to life in prison pursuant to a habitual felony offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4)(a) (Supp. 1988). Defendant appealed, claiming the trial court erred in concluding that the habitual felony offender statute mandated a life sentence and in applying the statute when defendant's offense was already punishable by a life sentence, and that the statute was unconstitutional due to the disparate results of its application. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that once a judge chose to apply the habitual felony offender statute, ordering a life sentence was not discretionary. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.081 (Supp. 1988) applied to all first-degree felonies, whether or not the punishment for the crime was a life sentence. The court held that ch. 775.084(4)(b) did not produce disparate treatment between habitual violent felony offenders and habitual felony offenders because both offenders were eligible for parole only if the sentences were commuted to terms, but if eligible, the violent offender was required to serve a minimum of years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for grand theft of a firearm, grand theft, and burglary of a dwelling while armed. The habitual felony offender statute mandated a life sentence, was properly applied to defendant even though his offense was already punishable by a life sentence, and did not lead to disparate treatment among habitual offenders. A question was certified to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court declined to provide petitioner any relief and referred the parties to mediation, petitioner sought review.

The court granted certiorari and quashed order denying relief in favor of mediation because, contrary to the trial court's finding, it was not necessary for the trial court to determine the nature and value of the parties' respective interests in the property based on respondent's other pending claims before making the award. The amount of damages assessed to petitioner would include not only the value of the property seized, but could also include an award of attorney's fees and costs to compensate for harm to petitioner's business, wrongful conversion of the property, and nonpecuniary injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder, attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, and aggravated assault. In his appeal, defendant challenged the attempted murder of a law enforcement officer statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 874.07(3) (1988), as unconstitutionally vague. The court held the statute was not vague. The statute did not require proof that the defendant was aware the victim was a law enforcement officer if the officer was engaged in the lawful performance of his duties at the time of the crime. However, the statute was also violated if there was proof the defendant attempted to murder the victim because of the victim's duties as a law enforcement officer. Though each violation differed with respect to the scienter requirement, the statute sufficiently notified defendant as to what conduct rendered him liable to its penalties. Further, although the statute did not distinguish between different degrees of attempted murder, it clearly subjected defendants committing any degree of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer to the same penalties. Defendant's convictions were therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 337.241(2) and (3) (1987), appellant agency recorded a map of reservation of right-of-way that included a portion of appellee property owner's land. Appellee filed an inverse condemnation action, and summary judgment was granted to appellee. Appellant sought review. The court noted that the statute authorizing issuance of the map was declared unconstitutional and that appellant had withdrawn its map. However, the court determined that during the time the map existed, appellant had taken appellee's property. The map did not substantially advance a legitimate state interest, and merely froze and depressed appellee's property's value. Because the authorizing statute was declared unconstitutional, appellee did not have to establish the market value of the property decreased to prove a taking occurred; such information was only relevant to the issue of the amount of compensation due appellee. The court therefore affirmed the order granting summary judgment to appellee, and requiring a jury trial be held as to the proper compensation due appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of DUI manslaughter under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 (1989). Appellant sought review of the judgment. At trial, a jury instruction that was taken almost verbatim from Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2)(c), (1989), was given to the jury. The instruction stated that the jury could find evidence that appellant had a .10 or more by weight of alcohol in his blood, as prima facie evidence that appellant was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his normal faculties were impaired. However, the jury instruction could be contradicted or rebutted by other evidence. Appellant contended that, under case law, the instruction created a mandatory, rebuttable presumption that acted improperly to shift the burden of proof as to the intoxication element to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Orange County, (Florida) granting the appellees' motion to suppress physical evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Appellees had been charged with keeping a house of ill fame in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.01(1987) and maintaining a public nuisance in violation of Fla. Stat. chs. 823.01, 823.05 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were charged with keeping a house of ill fame and maintaining a public nuisance. Appellees, a business and its owner, pleaded not guilty and filed a notice of election to participate in discovery. The state then obtained a search warrant from a different judge than the one to which this matter was assigned and seized property from appellees. Appellees filed a motion to suppress the property seized pursuant to the execution of the warrant. The trial court granted the appellees' motion to suppress because the affiant failed to set forth in the affidavit the fact that an indictment had been issued against the appellees, that they had pleaded not guilty, and that discovery had commenced in this matter. The state appealed. The court applied precedent and found that appellees not being indicted, pleading not guilty, and their election to participate in discovery bore no relation to a finding of probable cause to search appellees' property for evidence. Also, appellees were not due notice of an application for a search warrant under procedural rules. The trial court suppression for the appellees was reversed and the case remanded back for consideration on remaining issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial grant of appellees' motion to suppress because the appellees were not entitled to any notice of the state's application for a search warrant, but only whether there has been any search or seizure and of any documents relating thereto. Also, appellees' status as being indicted by a grand jury, having entered a guilty plea, and their participation in discovery had no bearing on a finding of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari seeking review of two court orders dismissing appeals taken under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 162.11(1989) from adverse orders of a county code enforcement board. The stated basis for dismissing the appeals was that petitioners had raised only constitutional issues in their brief. The lower court held that constitutional claims could not be raised in appeals to the circuit court under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 162. The constitutional issues raised by petitioners in their brief in each appeal were that: (1) the county ordinance creating the county's code enforcement board was facially unconstitutional; and (2) the actions of the board deprived petitioners of certain fundamental constitutional rights. The reviewing court concluded that procedural due process had not been accorded to the petitioners because the lower court had improperly refused to entertain petitioners' appeals on the merits, and that as a result a writ of certiorari would lie to quash the lower court's orders of dismissal. According to the court, constitutional claims such as those raised by petitioners were properly cognizable on an appeal taken pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 162.11(1989).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the personal representative of an estate, challenged an order denying his motion to strike appellee creditor's claim and granting appellee's motion to extend the time for filing a claim under Fla. Prob. R. 5.495. Appellant asserted that the court improperly applied Rule 5.495 retroactively, and even if the rule was applicable, appellee failed to prove sufficient facts for relief. Notice of administration was published three weeks after decedent's death. Appellee had three months within which to file claims under Fla. Stat. ch. 733.702. Appellee did not file a claim until two weeks after that period. Appellant moved to strike the late claim. Appellee filed for an extension under Rule 5.495, but offered no explanation for the failure to timely file the claim and merely alleged that its failure to file was excusable neglect. The court held that Rule 5.495 applied because the &quot;operative event&quot; (filing the claim) occurred after the effective date of the rule.

The trial court entered a final judgment holding that appellee was immune from liability under Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9)(b) (1987), which exempted a lessor if the lease was for a year or longer, and required the lessee to obtain certain coverage. On a motion for rehearing, the appellate court affirmed the trial court, finding that the plain language and legislative history of ch. 324.021(9)(b) indicated that it was enacted to limit the liability of lessors under the dangerous instrumentality doctrine. The court determined that the legislature intended to afford long-term lessors the same protection enjoyed by those who sold automobiles. Further, the court found that the statute was constitutional because the statute was reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective. The court found that leases exceeding one year were nothing more than alternative financing agreements which provided tax advantages to the lessee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which adjudicated him guilty for escaping from a detention facility in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061. The trial court denied appellant's motion for a judgment of acquittal and adjudicated him guilty of escape. Appellant contended that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the finding of guilt under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state presented evidence, which set forth a description of the residential program in which appellant juvenile participated. Appellee established that appellant attended a football game with a group from the facility as part of the program, that appellant left during the game, and did not return to the facility until the following day. The trial court denied appellant's motion for a judgment of acquittal and adjudicated him guilty of escape. Appellant contended that appellee failed to prove that the program that he left fell within restrictiveness level VI or higher as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(61), and thus failed to prove all the essential statutory elements of the offense. The court reversed and remanded, concluding that the trial court erred in not granting appellant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. Appellee presented no evidence as to any rule defining &quot;any secure detention or any residential commitment facility of restrictiveness level VI or above&quot; as specified in Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(61). Appellee failed to bring the rule defining restrictiveness levels to the attention of the trial judge and failed to ask that the rule be judicially noticed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order, which adjudicated appellant juvenile guilty of escape. The court remanded the case with directions to dismiss the charge; there was simply no evidence to prove that appellant was being held in a form of custody that met restrictiveness level VI or above, which was a critical element of escape under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of an order of the County Court in and for the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Putnam County (Florida), which held Fla. Stat. &sect; 316.193(4)&nbsp;unconstitutional and, as a consequence, disregarded the statutory enhanced penalties mandated in sentencing appellees convicted of driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state argued trial court error in holding Fla. Stat. &sect; 316.193(4) (1989) to be unconstitutional merely because appellees, convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), would have been sentenced to enhanced penalties that exceeded penalties for motorists who, unlike appellees, refused to take the breath test. Specifically, appellant contested the first-time offender sentences that were imposed. The court agreed, ruling that a successful equal protection challenge under U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV or Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 required disparate treatment of at least two categories of persons, which was not present here. The treatment of DUI offenders was the same, the court explaining that it was at the option of appellees whether they took the test. The option not to take the test was a &quot;grace&quot; and not a &quot;right,&quot; the court added. And even assuming disparate treatment, there existed a rational basis in public policy for different sentences, depending on a DUI suspect's choice and the severity of damage caused. And because the differing punishments between categories of similarly intoxicated offenders varied in small degree, no violation of amend. VIII occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order holding sentencing statute for intoxicated drivers unconstitutional and disregarding statutory enhanced penalties that were mandated for appellees reversed, and case remanded for sentencing, because appellees not relieved of enhanced sentences on equal protection grounds, as two categories of persons receiving disparate treatment not shown, and because rational basis existed for disparate sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the state, sought review of the order from the County Court for Orange County (Florida) that granted appellee's motion to suppress the breathalyzer test results, and certified the questions of whether Fla. Adm. Rule 10D-42.032 was void for vagueness, whether the revised form used in checking the breathalyzer complied with Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(f)(1), and if not whether appellant precluded from using the breathalyzer results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with driving under the influence in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 (1989) because the breathalyzer test showed a reading of .250. The trial court granted appellee's motion to suppress the test results, and certified questions asking if Fla. Adm. Rule 10D-42.023 was void for vagueness, if the revised form used in testing the breathalyzer was valid, if the state was precluded from using the test results, and if appellee could raise the issues in his case. The court held that because the department of health and rehabilitative services promulgated a rule mandating the use of an original form in testing the breathalyzer, the accuracy and reproducibility requirements of Fla. Adm. Rules 10D-42.023 and 10D-42.024 were not vague. However, because the revised form used in appellee's case had not been adopted as a rule pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(f)1, the revised form was unacceptable, appellant did not meet its burden of proving the breathalyzer was accurate and was precluded from using the test results, and appellee had the right to raise the issues in a motion to suppress. Therefore, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting appellee's motion to suppress the breathalyzer test results, because the rules mandating that the breathalyzer be accurate was not void for vagueness only if the original form was used. The revised form, which was used in appellee's case, was unacceptable because it had not been adopted pursuant to the statutory procedures, and appellee, the state, was thus precluded from using the test results.</SPAN></P>

Appellees sought and received summary judgment arguing that the 1975 Statute of Repose, former Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2), time-barred the action. Appellant challenged the ruling arguing that the action was covered under the new Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) which repealed the 12 year statute of repose in products liability actions. The court agreed with appellant holding that the new statute did not operate retroactively, but merely provided a definite date to break cleanly with past policy regarding repose in products liability actions. The court therefore reversed and remanded the action for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant University of Miami School of Medicine treated a minor for a brain tumor, and as a result of appellant's negligent acts, the minor's right hand and forearm had to be amputated to save her life. Appellee, minor and her parents, brought suit against appellant for medical malpractice, and appellant sought arbitration of appellees claims under Fla. Stat. ch.  766.207 (1988) and Fla. Stat. ch. 766.209 (1988). The trial court held that the statutes were unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, by denying appellees their right of access to the courts. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court held that the statutes did violate the constitution, as there was no alternative remedy or commensurate benefit to arbitration, and the legislature did not show an overpowering public necessity for the abolishment of the right to access to the courts. The court also determined that the cap placed upon appellees' recovery did not bear a rational relationship to the damages, and there was an absence of less onerous alternatives.

Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 4. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant pled no contest. The court reversed appellant's conviction. The ordinance was both unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it was not narrowly drawn and because it did not sufficiently inform persons of what conduct was prohibited. The ordinance, which forbid minors under the age of 16 from being on the streets or in public places from midnight to sunrise, did provide an exemption for minors who were on &quot;legitimate business.&quot; However, the term &quot;legitimate business&quot; also failed to give sufficient guidance to persons because the term &quot;legitimate&quot; was not defined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four years prior to the statutory ban on escalation clauses in condominium leases, Fla. Stat. ch. 711.213 (1975), appellant condominium association entered into a 99-year recreational lease for a pool deck with appellee corporation. The lease contained an annual escalation clause tied to the consumer price index. Eighteen years later, appellant paid the previously escalated rental fee but did not pay that year's escalation fee, and appellee sought a declaratory judgment that the amended version of the statutory ban, Fla. Stat. ch. 718.4015 (1988), violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, in that the statute impaired the obligation of contracts. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court and found that application of the statute to contracts entered into prior to enactment of the original statute was constitutionally prohibited. The court certified the question of whether an escalation clause for the entire term of a 99-year lease was enforceable, where the lessor had not agreed to be bound by future changes in a statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order that granted summary judgment for appellee corporation in an action for declaratory relief was affirmed because a statute which prohibited escalation clauses in condominium leases, when applied to leases entered into prior to implementation of the statute, was a violation of the United States and Florida Constitutions.

Appellant inmate filed an appeal from a judgment and sentence entered upon his conviction of escape. The appellant contended that substantive due process rights were violated when a defendant was classified as a violent felony offender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084, and thereby subjected to an extended term of imprisonment, if he had been convicted of an enumerated violent felony within the previous five years even though his present offense was a nonviolent felony. He asserted that to enhance a defendant's sentence for a nonviolent felony was not a reasonable means which bore a rational relationship to the legitimate goal of providing society added protection against violent individuals. The court found that the appellant failed to present convincing argument that the statute bore no rational relationship to its purported purpose. Just as the state was justified in punishing a recidivist more severely than it punished a first offender, its even more severe treatment of a recidivist who had exhibited a propensity toward violence was also reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, grand theft auto, resisting arrest with violence while armed with a firearm, and using a firearm in the commission of a felony following an incident wherein he fired four shots at an officer who had stopped him for a traffic offense. Appellant was sentenced to 25 years for the attempted first-degree murder conviction and to various lesser terms on the other charges. The court affirmed and held that conviction and sentencing for both attempted first-degree murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony did not constitute double jeopardy because the possession of a firearm was not an essential element of the offense of attempted first-degree murder. Moreover, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 787.07(3) was not vague and adequately specified the degrees of attempted murder to which the mandatory term set forth in Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of voir dire examination at appellant's trial for three counts of dealing in stolen property, the prosecutor excused two black prospective jurors.

The court then asked for an explanation for the exercise of the challenges. The prosecutor explained that he had based his decision on the fact that these jurors demonstrated a combination of unemployment and divorce, indicating a level of detachment from the proceedings not based on race. Defense counsel made a motion to strike the jury panel. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant was found guilty. Appellant then appealed the convictions and sentence. Affirming the trial court conviction, the appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions and the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying to strike the jury panel. The court explained that in the total context of the record, it found that reasonable persons could arguable agree with the trial court's actions.

Defendants appealed, claiming that they were entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees because they obtained a verdict in their favor after plaintiffs unreasonably rejected their settlement offer. The appellate reversed the trial court's decision, holding that an insured defendant could recover litigation costs that had been paid by the insurer. Additionally, plaintiffs rejected a settlement offer but were awarded nothing at trial, which under ch. 45.061 created the presumption that plaintiffs unreasonably rejected the offer. Finally, under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79(1)(a) (1987), a defendant was entitled to reasonable costs and fees incurred from the date of filing of the offer if the judgment obtained by the plaintiff was at least 25 percent less than the offer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a verdict finding him guilty of organized fraud and 33 counts of grand theft. Appellant asserted that the trial court erred in not directing a verdict on the organized fraud count, in refusing to direct a verdict on transactions in another county, in admitting evidence without a hearing, in limiting cross-examination, in using an improper scoresheet, and in granting an improper award of restitution. The charges arose from appellant's operation of a mortgage company. Appellant solicited investments and promised mortgages on real estate. Appellant misrepresented that he was a licensed mortgage broker and he exceeded promised mortgage limits. The court affirmed appellant's conviction for organized fraud under Fla. Stat. ch. 817.036 (1983), and 29 counts of grand theft. The court reversed four counts of grand theft for lack of venue and restitution for those counts. It was also error for the trial court to use a 1984 sentencing scoresheet, because the crimes took place prior to the effective date of the guidelines. On remand, appellant may elect to be sentenced under current guidelines or under pre-guideline sentencing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), that convicted him of kidnapping, two counts of sexual battery, burglary, and robbery, as well as sentenced him as a habitual offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1988). Defendant claimed that ch. 775.084 was unconstitutional and that his motion for acquittal on one of the battery charges should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping, two counts of sexual battery, burglary, and robbery. At the time of the offenses he was on probation for committing the similar crimes 10 years earlier, so the trial court sentenced defendant as a habitual offender. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence, claiming that his motion for acquittal on one of the sexual battery charges should have been granted and that the Florida habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1988), was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the habitual offender statute had previously been found constitutional. Additionally, the question of whether defendant should have been acquitted of one of the counts of sexual battery was for the jury to decide. The victim testified that defendant penetrated her with his penis and his finger or a towel, and the trial court held that whether the separate penetrations constituted separated offenses was a matter for the jury to decide. The jury held that two batteries occurred, so defendant was not entitled to acquittal on the second charge. As a result, the trial court properly convicted and sentenced defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment and sentence imposed upon defendant for the offenses of kidnapping, two counts of sexual battery, burglary, and robbery. Contrary to defendant's claim the habitual offender statute was constitutional, and defendant was not entitled to acquittal on the second battery claim where the jury was free to decide whether defendant's actions constituted two separate batteries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced in two separate burglary cases. On appeal, he challenged the lower court's decision to sentence him as a habitual felony offender in the second case.

The court rejected appellant's contention that two versions of the state habitual felony offender statute were unconstitutional. The court found, however, that appellant was improperly adjudicated by the lower court to be a habitual felony offender in his second case. The lower court based its determination on the fact that appellant had three felony convictions in his first case, which were all entered on the same day, but Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1988) required that the convictions be sequential. The court, therefore, reversed and remanded appellant's case for resentencing and correction of appellant's credit for time served in the lower court's written judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere as not being freely and voluntarily entered. The trial court denied the motion in reliance on the written plea agreement. Defendant appealed, and the reviewing court affirmed. The court found that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800 did not authorize a belated motion collaterally attacking a legal sentence imposed pursuant to a written plea agreement. The court concluded that defendant could not resort to any of the provisions to obtain relief under the circumstances alleged in his motions. However, the court determined that if the allegations in his motion were true, defendant was misled and incompetently informed about his sentence as a habitual felony offender. Defense counsel apparently failed to fulfill the responsibilities imposed upon him by Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.171(c) (2) by permitting defendant to sign a plea agreement that did not accurately reflect the true intent of the negotiated plea agreement. The court held that the failure on defense counsel's part amounted to a clear instance of ineffective assistance of counsel, if shown by the facts to be true. Therefore, defendant had an avenue of relief available to him.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court upheld the sentence, but struck down the fine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant, appellee employer, and appellee insurance carrier sought review of a workers' compensation order from the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida), which awarded appellant claimant attendant-care benefits and denied certain other benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part an order from a judge of compensation claims (JCC) awarding claimant attendant-care benefits and denying certain other benefits. Appellant claimant sustained injury to his lower back in an industrial accident in 1982. He had surgery on his back and reached maximum medical improvement in 1983 with an impairment rating of 25 percent. As a result of his injuries, appellant needed some level of assistance with his activities of daily living from 1982. At issue on appeal were the JCC's award of attendant care and the value of that care during certain periods. The court held that the JCC's determinations had to be based on competent substantial evidence. While a JCC could under certain circumstances reject unrefuted medical testimony as to attendant care, it was improper to do so without giving sufficient reasons. Here, the JCC gave no reason for rejecting the opinion of appellant's treating physician concerning what attendant care was needed during the initial period. Moreover, it was not apparent from the record why that opinion was rejected. Further, it was not apparent how the JCC arrived at the value of the attendant care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, automobile owner and driver, after being sued by the passenger of another motor vehicle following an automobile accident, filed a third-party complaint seeking contribution from appellees, automobile owner and driver, in whose car the injured passenger was riding. Appellees presented appellants with a settlement offer, but the offer was declined. Appellants later settled with the injured passenger, after which they dismissed their lawsuit against appellees. Appellees then filed motions to tax costs and attorney fees on appellants, contending their settlement offer was unreasonably rejected. The circuit court granted appellees the recovery they sought. On appeal, however, the court reversed, holding that an award of costs and fees was inappropriate in the absence of a plaintiff's verdict, rather than a third-party verdict, and because there was no finding that appellants' rejection was unreasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's armed robbery, attempted murder, and aggravated assault convictions.

The court found that under the unique circumstances of the case, defendant should have been allowed to question the witness concerning his prior inconsistent deposition testimony. The circumstances included that the disputed testimony concerned the officer's own observations, the disputed prior testimony was introduced in two previous trials where the jury failed to reach a verdict, and the previous testimony would have indicated that defendant could not have been guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), denying his motion to suppress handgun evidence. Defendant claimed a police officer's stop of him for riding a bicycle without a bell, in violation of Orlando, Fla., Code ch. 10, &sect; 1.08, was pretextual. Defendant argued the violation of a municipal ordinance was not a crime, thus, the discovery of gun evidence incident to his arrest was suppressible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because violation of a bicycle bell ordinance, Orlando, Fla., Code ch. 10, &sect; 1.08, was considered a crime, evidence from a search incident to an arrest for violation of the ordinance was not suppressible. Defendant was arrested for riding a bicycle without a bell or gong, in violation of a city ordinance. Police searched defendant as an incident to an arrest. Defendant was charged with carrying a concealed firearm, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.01(2). Defendant brought a motion to suppress the firearm, arguing the stop was pretextual, violation of the ordinance was not a crime, the search was not incident to arrest because defendant was not arrested for violation of the ordinance, the ordinance was unconstitutional, and a state statute preempted the ordinance. The reviewing court affirmed, holding that suppression was not required because violation of the ordinance constituted a crime. Thus, the search incident to arrest was lawful, and the fruits of that arrest were admissible. A state statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 316.2065 did not preempt the ordinance because the statute did not prohibit bells, but simply required certain equipment. Thus, the ordinance was validly enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress gun evidence arising from a search incident to an arrest. Because a bicycle bell ordinance for which defendant was stopped was a valid exercise of municipal power, defendant was properly stopped for failing to have a bell on his bicycle. Thus, a search incident to the arrest was legal, and gun evidence arising from the search was not suppressible.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the trial court was directed to dismiss that charge. Nevertheless, the court determined that the evidence established that appellant was guilty of the lesser included offense of keeping a house of prostitution under Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(2)(a) (1987).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine and sale or delivery of cocaine. He sought review of his convictions and sentences. Appellant first argued that the use of an informant by police in making his arrest violated due process under certain case law. There was no indication that the informant was paid a fee contingent upon the amount of contraband obtained by police or that police promised the informant deferential treatment. Therefore, the appellate court found the issue was without merit. Appellant also argued that that the dual convictions for simple possession and sale of the same quantum of cocaine violated the guarantee against double jeopardy. The state supreme court had recently settled the issue. Such a situation did not constitute double jeopardy when the crimes occurred after the effective date of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.021 (Supp. 1988). The convictions were affirmed. The record as supplemented by appellee state belied appellant's assertion that appellee did not file notice to have him sentenced as a habitual felony offender. Appellant's arguments as to the unconstitutional nature of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(a) (1988) had been considered and rejected. Affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's status as a habitual offender, was not a valid reason to depart from the sentencing guideline. A sentence imposed upon appellant as a habitual felony offender was not subject to the sentencing guidelines, but the previous offenses needed to be imposed within the guidelines presumptive ranges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sealed a letter from minor's treating psychologist and then closed the dependency hearing. Petitioners sought to set aside the restraining order. When its motion was denied, petitioners filed a writ of certiorari for review. Petitioners argued that the order restrained the publication of information which was in their possession, rather than an order limiting their access to information. The dependency proceeding did not qualify for automatic closure. The letter provided to the court was simply correspondence between the treating psychologist and an employee of the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Thus, it was not a court record, subject to closure. Although the government could deny access to information, it could not prohibit publication of information already in the hands of the press unless the need for secrecy was manifestly overwhelming. Since there were no findings of fact to support the need for restraint, or what possible injury might result from publication, the order was quashed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of battery and grand theft auto, argued that he did not qualify as a habitual offender for sentencing purposes because he was convicted and sentenced for two prior felonies during a single hearing on the same day. For purposes of habitualization, appellant contended, each offense must follow a conviction for the immediately previous offense, a sequence that was not evident here. While the court agreed with the state that the plain language of the amended statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. &sect; 775.084(1)(a)1 (1988), did not require sequential convictions -- the provision being silent on whether prior offenses needed to be separate in time -- it ruled that legislative intent must be examined to see if an interpretation was required that exceeded the literal language of the statute. Ruling that the legislature did not use unmistakable language in the 1988 version of the statute that would have overturned the precedent for sequential convictions, and that the purpose underlying the sequential convictions requirement was to provide an offender an opportunity to reform, or see whether he persisted in crime, the court set aside appellant's enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Enhanced sentence imposed on appellant as a habitual offender following his conviction of battery and grand theft auto was reversed, and case was remanded for resentencing, because appellant did not qualify as a habitual offender for sentencing purposes, because his two prior convictions on the same date failed to satisfy the sequential convictions requirement for enhanced sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state challenged an order by the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) holding unconstitutional a portion of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 800.04 (1989) which provided that consent was not a defense to violations of the statute, where respondents who were charged with having intercourse with a minor claimed that they had standing to raise the issue of the victim's right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were charged with violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 800.04(2) (1989) by having sexual intercourse with a child of less than sixteen years. Respondents claimed that &sect; 800.04, barring the consent defense, violated the minor's right of privacy guaranteed by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 and further denied respondents due process of law. The trial court found that respondents had standing to assert the victim's right and that the statute impermissibly interfered with the victim's right of privacy in her sexual relations. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that respondents did not have standing because there was no special relationship between them and the minor victim of the type found in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). The court held that unlike in Griswold, in this case it was the victim herself who reported the sexual battery and testified against respondents at the bond hearing; therefore, it was apparent that the victim was not looking to respondents to assert her right of privacy. The court concluded that since respondents did not have standing, it was unnecessary to address the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the order of the trial court, which held that respondents had standing to assert the victim's right of privacy. The court held that since there was no special relationship between respondents and the minor victim, they did not have standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) convicting him of sexual battery and aggravated assault. Defendant alleged several errors, including that the trial court's failure to properly apply the Florida Rape Shield Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 794.022 (1987) prevented him from presenting reputation evidence regarding the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery and aggravated assault. Defendant sought review, raising various claims of error, including that the lower court's misapplication of the Florida Rape Shield Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 794.022 (1987), erroneously precluded him from presenting reputation evidence that the victim was a prostitute. The court noted that defendant clearly did not seek to offer evidence of specific prior acts of prostitution by the victim, but merely evidence dealing with her reputation for prostitution, such that the harmfulness of the exclusion was a matter of pure conjecture. Further, the court held that the level of violence against the victim weighed heavily against defendant's contention that the victim's reputation would have any significant bearing on consent. Finally, the court found that defendant's other arguments, including those regarding peremptory juror challenges and refusal to allow certain questions to be asked of the victim, were meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment convicting defendant, holding that the state rape shield law had been properly applied because defendant's proposed evidence was general and conjectural, and finding that defendant's claims regarding juror challenges, questioning of the victim, and double jeopardy were meritless.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that when read together, the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 838.021, defining the proscribed offense and the penalties for commission of the offense, evinced legislative intent to protect public servants from coercion or unlawful influence in the performance of a discretionary public duty and did not violate equal protection principles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following her convictions for resisting an officer with violence, loitering for the purpose of prostitution in violation of a city ordinance, and battery of a law enforcement officer in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 784.07 (1987), appellant sought review of the latter two convictions. Appellant asserted that the city ordinance was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the loitering conviction because the state supreme court had repeatedly upheld a less specific state loitering statute. Appellant also contended that the court was required to reverse her conviction for battery of a law enforcement officer because the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of simple battery. The court agreed and held it could not hold that the error was harmless due to precedential case law. The court, therefore, reversed in part and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the legislative history of ch. 790.165(1) made clear that the legislature intended to proscribe the misrepresentation of an object as a bomb. Concluding that misrepresentation required intent, the court held that violation of ch. 790.165(1) required that the perpetrator design, intend, or use the imitation destructive device in such a way as to appear to be a weapon and remanded the case for a determination of defendant's intent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, appellee, a savings and loan association, recorded a mortgage securing payment of a promissory note from appellee landowners. In 1987, appellant Sarasota County found appellee landowners in violation of a county ordinance and subsequently filed a lien against the same property. Relying on County Ordinance 84-06, appellant filed suit to foreclose, claiming that its lien was superior to all liens except tax liens. Appellee savings and loan challenged appellant's assertion and the lower court entered a final summary judgment, stating that the portion of the ordinance attempting to make appellant's lien superior to all others was unconstitutional as applied to appellee savings and loan. The court agreed and held that U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 prohibited statutes that rewrote substantive rights of the parties to existing contracts. The court held that appellee, a savings and loan association, had a vested interest that was adversely effected by the county ordinance, as its chances of recovery were lessened if it was a second lienholder and its ability to sell the mortgage on a secondary market was impaired.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellee's alleged good faith was a question of fact and there was no evidence before the trial court which would have resolved that issue at the summary judgment stage.</SPAN></P>

In reversing, the appellate court concluded that the contempt order was defective because it lacked a separate, affirming finding, as required by law, that appellant had the present ability to pay the amounts specified in the order appellant was found to have violated. Further, the order was defective in that it did not contain an express provision for purging any contempt after incarceration through payment of the ordered amounts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of attempted second degree murder and shooting into an occupied vehicle. He was sentenced as a habitual offender to life imprisonment with a minimum mandatory three years for the use of a firearm in the commission of the attempted murder. He was sentenced as a habitual offender to 30 years' imprisonment, including a three year minimum mandatory for the use of a firearm in the commission of shooting into an occupied vehicle After serving five years' imprisonment, the balance of this sentence was suspended and he was placed on 25 years' probation. On appeal, appellant contended that the habitual offender statute was unconstitutional. The court found that this contention had no merit. Appellant also argued that consecutive three year minimum mandatory sentences could not be imposed for consecutive sentences arising from the same criminal episode. The court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(2)(a) (1989) did not provide for the imposition of a three year minimum mandatory sentence for shooting into an occupied vehicle. Accordingly, the court vacated that part of appellant's sentence but affirmed the convictions and sentences in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county sheriff determined that respondent aircraft owners' airplane fuel tanks did not conform to Fla. Stat. ch. 330.40 (1987). Petitioner forfeited the airplanes pursuant to the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act, which declared all nonconforming aircraft per se contraband. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss asserting that ch. 330.40 was unconstitutional because it violated their substantive due process rights. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. In affirming the trial court's order and holding ch. 330.40 unconstitutional, the court recognized that the purpose of the statute was to stem trafficking in illegal drugs. However, the court found that ch.330.40 provided for automatic confiscation and forfeiture simply upon a showing that aircraft tanks did not meet statutory requirements. The court found that confiscation could occur without evidence of criminal behavior. The statute gave law enforcement untethered discretion to forfeit, and deprived the trial court of any discretion other than procedural review. The court stated that the statute was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious and lacked a substantial relation to its objective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of petitioner county sheriff's action forfeiting respondent aircraft owners' airplanes. The court held that provision of the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act allowing immediate confiscation and forfeiture of airplanes whose fuel tanks did not comply with federal regulations was unconstitutional because the statute precluded pre-forfeiture judicial review and permitted forfeiture for non-criminal activities.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the claim that one was sentenced pursuant to invalid sentencing guidelines stated a claim that one had received an illegal sentence, for which state post-conviction relief was available, and the mere fact that appellant acquiesced to being sentenced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines did not matter because he was never told that he was opting to be sentenced pursuant to invalid guidelines.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions and sentences for simple robbery, resisting arrest with violence, and aggravated assault without a firearm. On appeal, he claimed that a post-arrest show-up procedure tainted the victim's in-court identification and that the enhanced penalty under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (Supp. 1988), was void because the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the first point without discussion. The court also affirmed the constitutionality of ch. 775.084, based on prior caselaw. In response to appellant's novel arguments that the statute was impermissibly vague, was devoid of standards, and unconstitutionally delegated the function of determining punishment to law enforcement agencies, the court rejected those contentions and affirmed the sentence. The court found that the procedures and criteria contained in ch. 775.084 provided sufficient guidelines to permit the judiciary to implement the legislative policy embodied in the statute. The court also found that the discretionary power given to judges was within the traditional parameters of discretion invested on matters of sentencing and that the statute was not vague.</SPAN></P>

First, appellant alleged that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution to offer evidence that appellant sold cocaine within 25 feet of a daycare center and that appellant fit the profile of a drug seller using minors to carry drugs. The appellate court did not address appellant's allegations because appellant failed to preserve the issue for appellate review. Second, appellant alleged that ch. 775.084 was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court held the statute to be constitutional. The court found that the statute gave the trial court discretion regarding whether to impose a classification of habitual offender on a criminal defendant.

On appeal, the court reversed all of the convictions for grand theft and all but one of the four racketeering convictions. The court held that these convictions constituted double jeopardy violations because all elements of theft were included within the elements of organized fraud, making them, for double jeopardy purposes, the same offense. The court held that appellant's actions qualified as a single racketeering offense. The court affirmed the other convictions for organized fraud, forgery, uttering a false instrument, and one racketeering charge and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced under Florida's Habitual Felony Defender Act (&quot;Act&quot;), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084. Defendant asserted that the Act unconstitutionally denied equal protection and due process. He also argued that the sentence imposed orally by the court differed from the sentence on the record. The trial court orally pronounced defendant to have been a habitual offender and imposed consecutive five year sentences, but the written findings indicated that defendant was a habitual violent felony offender and imposed consecutive 10 year sentences, each with a five year minimum mandatory term. The court affirmed the judgment but vacated defendant's sentences. The issues of constitutionality were meritless, since the Act was previously found to be constitutional. However, the court found that the record was inconclusive as to which sentence was intended. Thus, the case was remanded for clarification and an appropriate resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's argument that his convictions for both the sale and the possession of a controlled substance were impermissible. The record showed that incident to each of the charged transactions defendant retained possession of cannabis other than the cannabis he sold and, thus, the record contained evidence supporting separate convictions on each of the offenses charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his criminal conviction and sentence from the Circuit Court, Escambia County (Florida). The trial court sentenced defendant as an habitual offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4) (1988) without making any finding that it was necessary for public protection and without giving defendant notice. The trial court also ordered defendant to make restitution as determined by probation and parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence, raising five issues. The court affirmed on five of the four issues. First, the court held that defendant failed to preserve for appeal the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence because defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal made below was deficient. Second, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1988) was not unconstitutional on the arguments raised in defendant's brief. Third, the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant as a habitual felony offender without making certain findings or providing notice to defendant. The court held that under ch. 775.084, a court that sentenced a defendant as an habitual offender was neither required to make any finding that it was necessary for public protection nor required to give a defendant notice pending the sentencing. Fourth, the court held that there was no requirement to give written reasons for imposing a guideline departure sentence once it was determined that defendant fit the definition of an habitual offender. On the fifth issue, the court reversed the restitution imposed on defendant because the amount had to be set by a court and not a probation or parole officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence except that it reversed that part of the sentence that ordered restitution as determined by a probation and parole officer, because the amount of restitution had to be determined by the trial court. The court held that the habitual offender statute did not require a finding of necessity of a sentence for public protection or notice of intention to seek habitual offender sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second degree murder. He filed a motion in limine, seeking to bar the dying declaration of his alleged victim. After the trial court concluded that the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule was unconstitutional, the prosecution petitioned for a writ of certiorari to review the order granting defendant's motion in limine. In granting the petition and reversing the order of the trial court, the appellate court concluded that the admission of dying declarations was justified on the grounds of public necessity, manifest justice, and the sense that impending death made a false statement by the decedent improbable. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that Fla. Stat. ch. 90.804(2)(b) (1989), the dying declaration exception, denied him his right of confrontation, as he could confront the witness offering testimony regarding the victim's dying declaration. Further, the courts permitted impeachment and discrediting of dying declaration evidence by the admission of contradictory, inconsistent, or conflicting statements and by the introduction of evidence establishing that the declarant did not accurately observe the facts recounted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which denied appellant's motion for post-conviction relief. The case had been remanded because the trial court imposed a guideline sentence without an affirmative request from appellant; and after remand, the trial court deleted any reference to sentencing guidelines but did not alter the length of the six sentences themselves.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that because six of the nine offenses had occurred prior to October 1, 1983, it was error to impose a guideline sentence without an affirmative request from appellant. After remand, the trial court deleted any reference to sentencing guidelines but did not alter the length of the six sentences. Because the three most recent of appellant's offenses occurred in February 1984, a guideline sentence could be imposed for those crimes only upon his affirmative request. There appeared to have been no such selection, since at the time of the original 1984 sentencing hearing all parties believed a guideline sentence was mandatory for these three offenses. Appellant was therefore entitled to correction of these sentences. Also, the court concluded that should appellant opt for a guideline sentence, and the trial court was considering another upward departure, the trial court should look only to the reasons originally provided and could not craft new reasons. If subsequent case law invalidated any of those reasons, they were no longer to be considered. However, if any one of the departure criteria remained valid, the court could again impose a departure sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the order of the trial court, which denied to re-sentence appellant. It was improper for the trial court to impose a guideline sentence without an affirmative request from appellant; also, if appellant opted for a guideline sentence and the trial court was to consider another upward departure the trial court could not craft new reasons to support the departure.</SPAN></P>

A dependent child has been abandoned, abused, or neglected by his parents or custodians as provided in Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(9)(a) (1987). A child was considered neglected when a parent permitted him to live in an environment when such environment caused the child's physical health to be in danger of being significantly impaired. Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(27) (1987). Neglect must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Fla. Stat. ch. 39.408(2)(b) (1987). Because the child's inadequate weight gain occurred in the home in the custody of his parents and because his condition was potentially dangerous, the court held that there was sufficient, competent evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the child was dependent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a reverse sting operation, a detective arranged through a confidential informant to sell cocaine to defendants. The defendants were tried jointly for trafficking and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. Counsel for all defendants stipulated to the voir dire of prospective jurors in the absence of the court. Additionally, one defendant consented to representation during voir dire by counsel for a codefendant while his attorney was out of town. Defendants raised the defense of entrapment at trial. Ultimately, all defendants were found guilty of attempted trafficking and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conspiracy convictions. The court also rejected defendants' assertions that they did not knowingly and intelligently waive their right to have the trial judge present during voir dire. The court concluded that the entrapment statute did not violate defendants' constitutional rights by requiring them to prove that they were not predisposed to commit the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Duval County (Florida), convicting him for escape from a jail and sentencing him as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with escaping from jail, and, following closing arguments, his counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds that appellee state's comments on appellant's failure to call certain witnesses impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defense. The motion was denied, and appellant challenged his subsequent conviction and sentencing on several grounds. The court affirmed the orders and found that appellee's statement was not improper because it addressed a principal issue, appellant's sanity, and defense counsel had introduced the previous opinions of non-witnesses that appellee's comments responded to. The court also held that an ex parte communication between the trial judge and appellee had not prejudiced appellant because there was no evidence or allegation that the jury was improperly instructed by the judge or somehow tainted by the improper conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's conviction and sentencing of appellant because, while an improper ex parte communication occurred, appellant did not demonstrate prejudice and did not properly preserve the point for appeal; therefore the error was not so fundamental as to mandate reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of armed robbery and aggravated assault, adjudged a habitual offender, and sentenced to life imprisonment for armed robbery with a consecutive sentence of 10 years for aggravated assault.

The court held that appellant was not entitled to any jail time credit for his consecutive sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment from the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida), which found them guilty of felony child abuse and third-degree murder in the death of their seven-year-old daughter, claiming that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss and denying them a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A seven-year-old girl suffered from juvenile diabetes, and her medical condition began to deteriorate. Appellants, parents of the child, refused to allow the child to receive medical treatment, in accordance with their religious beliefs. The child died and appellants were charged and convicted of felony child abuse and third-degree murder. Appellants challenged the verdict, claiming that their motion to dismiss and motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted; that Florida's child abuse statutes authorized the course of action they took; and that the jury impermissibly decided whether they were reasonable in following their religious beliefs. The court held that there was no right to withhold medical treatment for a child for religious beliefs under either the U.S. Const. amend. I. or in Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court also determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 415.503(7)(f) (1985) did not provide appellants with immunity because that statute did not apply to their criminal charges. Finally, the court concluded that the jury did not impermissibly decide appellant's religious beliefs, but merely whether they acted reasonably, and affirmed their convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that appellants were properly convicted of felony child abuse and third degree murder for failing to provide medical treatment to their seven-year-old daughter, stating that appellants' freedom of religion was not violated, appellants did not have immunity for their actions, and that there was no reversible errors at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), that granted defendant's motion to dismiss information and that found the language of Fla. Stat. ch. 538.011 (1987) (repealed 1989) was unconstitutionally vague allowing for arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss information and found that Fla. Stat. ch. 538.011 (1987) (repealed 1989) was unconstitutionally vague allowing for arbitrary enforcement, the state appealed. Upon review, the appellate court reversed the ruling of the trial court. It stated that while ch. 538.011 was a state criminal statute, it fit within a narrow category of regulatory legislation, for which greater leeway was to have been used when reviewing the statute on vagueness grounds. The appellate court found that ch. 538.011 cured the vagueness standards that once plagued its predecessor statutes because it conveyed sufficient definite warnings as to the conduct required and proscribed as measured by common understanding and practice. Ch. 538.01 clearly defined &quot;precious metals,&quot; &quot;precious metal dealers,&quot; the schedule of inspection for records, the manner of identification of &quot;precious metal dealers&quot; within their records and the fact that a copy of the records of any purchase of precious metals was to have been submitted to the sheriff of the county in which the business was operated. Ch. 538.011 was a valid exercise of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the order that granted defendant's motion to dismiss information and that found the language of the criminal statute at issue unconstitutionally vague allowing for arbitrary enforcement. The statute was constitutional, established a reasonably definite standard of conduct, and met the standards for vagueness. It cured the defects of its predecessor statute and it was a valid exercise of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant a jury trial, found appellant to be the father of the child, and set his support obligation. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that in Florida, for a child to be &quot;illegitimate,&quot; the child must be conceived and born at a time the child's mother was not lawfully married. Because the child was conceived during the marriage, the child was legitimate; therefore, appellant was not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of paternity, before being ordered to pay child support.</SPAN></P>

Upon dismissal of her suit for failure to prosecute, appellant argued that the statute requiring the posting of bond violated a state constitution's provision ensuring open access to the court system. The court refused to determine whether the bond statute was facially unconstitutional, holding instead that it was unconstitutional as it was applied to appellant. The court reasoned that statute illegally precluded appellant from exercising her constitutional right of access to the court system merely because of her financial inability to post the bond.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A class action was brought against appellant county which sought the refund of impact fees and to have the impact fee ordinance declared unconstitutional. A temporary injunction was entered in that case restraining appellant from further collection of the fees before final judgment. The class certification order in that case specifically mandated that notice of the action be furnished by certified mail to every present and future member of the class. A final judgment was entered upholding the ordinance. The temporary injunction ended and appellant was free to collect all fees. Appellant attempted to collect from appellees, however, appellees asserted that the statute of limitations had run on that claim because they had not received notice of the class action. Appellant argued that the tolling of the statute of limitations, during the term of the temporary injunction in the earlier case, was res judicata as to all potential class members even if unnamed and without notice. The court concluded that the temporary injunction in the class action did not toll the statute of limitations as to appellant's claims against the appellees. The dismissal of the consolidated cases was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was a former attorney who was convicted of tampering with a witness and conspiracy to tamper with a witness. Appellant's challenge from the convictions was dismissed for nonprosecution.

Appellant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion was denied because he was not a prisoner in custody under sentence. The court affirmed and held that appellant was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because at the time he filed the petition, he had not filed a motion for postconviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of burglary of a dwelling and one count of burglary of a structure. He was sentenced as a habitual offender to a total of thirty years incarceration and he appealed. He claimed that that the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Fla.

He also argued that the written judgments and sentences did not conform to the oral pronouncement at the sentencing hearing. The appeals court rejected his argument about the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1989). However, the court agreed that there was an error in his written judgments, probably attributable to a scrivener's error. The case was remanded in order to correct the sentences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court authorized appellee county's animal control division to enforce the county's vicious dog ordinance by disposing of appellant dog owners' two pit bull dogs. Appellants contended in their appeal that the trial court did not comply with a county ordinance that required the dogs to first be declared vicious and thereafter committed the vicious act before appellee county may impound the dogs. They further argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional, lacked administrative guidelines, and deprived appellants of property without due process. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling, holding that the trial court correctly interpreted the ordinance as providing for the protection of the public under the county's police powers. Appellant's dogs mauled two people in two separate incidents and appellant's interpretation of the ordinance, which would require the dogs attack another time, was unjust and illogical. The ordinance met the standards to avoid arbitrary decisions and was reasonable in order to protect public safety. Thus, the ordinance was constitutional and did not deprive appellants of their due process rights.</SPAN></P>

When appellee attempted to conduct pre-suit discovery as mandated by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 768.57, appellants were uncooperative and refused to answer almost all of appellee's questions. Appellants refused to inform appellee of the manner in which they were claiming appellee's care deviated from the standard of care. The trial court dismissed the case and entered a final judgment in favor of appellee, and appellants sought review. The court noted that while compliance with &sect; 768.57 was mandatory, it was also to be enforced in a reasonable manner. However, the court found that the record showed that appellants provided absolutely no information concerning the manner in which appellee had deviated from the standard of care. The court held that appellant's refusal to cooperate precluded any possibility of fruitful negotiation and frustrated the spirit and intent of the statute.

Stat. ch. 775.084 (1988), on the grounds that the enhanced sentence violated defendant's of equal protection and due process under U.S. Const. amend XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court affirmed the conviction and held that there was no violation of defendant's constitutional rights of equal protection, because classification of habitual offenders was rationally related to a legitimate state interest of punishing recidivists more severely than first time offenders. The classification was not arbitrary, because under ch. 775.084(1)(a), the state only need prove two or more of the requisite felony convictions within as prescribed period of time. Ch. 775.084(4)(c) did not violate defendant's due process rights, because the trial judge's discretion to determine that a defendant was not a danger to society had not shifted the burden to defendant. The discretion was analogous to a judge's ability to depart downward based on valid reasons in cases governed by the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was arrested by plainclothes police officers after they observed her performing alleged indecent acts in a lingerie show at a lounge where alcohol was served. Plaintiff sued defendant alleging false arrest, malicious prosecution, and defamation. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant. The appellate court found that the facts material to the issue of probable cause relating to the false arrest and malicious prosecution counts were in sharp dispute and, therefore, summary judgment was improper. A police officer can arrest without a warrant if a violation of municipal ordinance or a misdemeanor is committed in his presence. However, when the underlying facts are in controversy the issue must be submitted to the jury.

The lower court refused to set aside the property as homestead, and this appeal followed. Appellants argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 732.401 somehow vested some rights in them. The court disagreed. It was the state constitution which primarily controlled here, and Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(c) was designed to protect two classes of persons only: surviving spouses and minor children. Appellants were neither of these. The statute permitted decedent's wife to waive her constitutional right. Thus, the lower court properly refused to set aside the property as homestead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of an order of commitment from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which confined him to the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. The trial court found that appellant met the criteria set out in Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(46) (Supp. 1988), and committed appellant to a program for serious habitual juvenile offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile pleaded guilty to grand theft, resisting arrest without violence, and petit theft. Subsequently, the state filed a petition for serious habitual juvenile offender placement under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(46) (Supp. 1988). The trial court committed appellant to the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services program because he met the criteria set out in Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(46) (Supp. 1988). Appellant challenged his conviction, arguing that the serious juvenile habitual offender statute was unconstitutional because its criteria were based merely on prior arrests. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(46) (Supp. 1988) and Fla. Stat. ch. 39.09(5) (Supp. 1988) violated substantive due process as provided in U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court held that one of the criteria contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(46) (Supp. 1988) was a juvenile's prior arrest record and that state cannot penalize someone through its criminal process merely for being under indictment or otherwise accused of a crime. The court reversed the order of commitment and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant juvenile's commitment and declared the juvenile habitual offender statute unconstitutional. The court held that using appellant's prior arrest record as the basis for commitment penalized appellant merely for his status. The court determined that this statute violated substantive due process as found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the Florida constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insureds challenged a discovery order of the court in a suit filed against appellee insured for damages incurred in an automobile accident.

R. Civ. P. 1.360(b)(2). The trial court ordered appellants to sign a medical release that permitted the informal discussion. Appellants alleged that the order violated the provisions of Fla.

Stat. ch. 455.241 (1988) to maintain the confidentiality of medical information pertaining to him that was in the possession of medical care providers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida), which assessed a number of charges against appellant pursuant to Fla. Stat. chs. 960.20, 960.25, and 943.25 (1987), related to his conviction for certain offenses. Appellant also sought clarification regarding which charges were considered costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At sentencing a number of charges were assessed against appellant by the trial court, without prior notice or a hearing. The charges included a sum pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 960.20 (1987) and a sum pursuant to Fla. Stat. 943.25 (1987), as well as a surcharge of five percent on a fine assessed against appellant pursuant to Fla. Sta. ch. 960.25 (1987). The court reversed the order and remanded the case, directing the trial court to allow appellant notice and a hearing. Appellant sought clarification regarding the nature of the charges, and the motion was granted. The court noted that the express language of chs. 960.20 and 943.25 stated that the charges were to be charged as costs. However, the five-percent surcharge pursuant to ch. 960.25 was a fine rather than a cost. The supreme court had stated that the surcharge could properly be regarded as a form of punishment for the offense committed. Therefore, the court remanded the case for the trial court to impose costs under chs. 960.20 and 943.25, but not to include the surcharge pursuant to ch. 960.25 as a cost because it was part of the fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted appellant's motion for clarification regarding charges assessed to him at sentencing and determined that two of the charges were to be regarded as costs, and one of the charges represented a fine where it was a form of punishment for the offense committed. The court remanded the case to the trial court to properly assess the fines and costs against appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for capital sexual battery entered in the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), contending that the trial court's action in clearing the courtroom pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial for capital sexual battery, the courtroom was cleared during the minor victim's testimony. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court's action in clearing the courtroom pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 918.16 (1987) violated his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a public trial. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of ch. 918.16. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute in question, but reversed defendant's conviction. The court found the application of the statute to be unconstitutional because the trial court failed to make any findings to justify the closure. In order to justify any type of closure, whether total or partial, the trial court must find that a denial of such right was necessitated by a compelling governmental interest and was narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Absent such a finding, the closure was unconstitutional and therefore necessitated a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed conviction from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) for a fourth driving under the influence (DUI) offense. Defendant argued that his earlier DUI conviction was uncounseled and therefore it could not be used to enhance the severity, hence punishment, of a subsequent offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed conviction for a fourth driving under the influence offense. Defendant argued a prior 1978 conviction could not be used to enhance the present offense from misdemeanor to felony pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(2)(b) (1987). Defendant argued such enhanced punishment was violative of U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel, and the burden was on the prosecution at trial to show that 1978 conviction was counseled or that counsel was waived. The appellate court held conviction obtained in violation of defendant's constitutional right to counsel was void and could not be used by the prosecution in a subsequent criminal proceeding to support conviction under an enhancement statute designed to increase the allowable period of imprisonment. However, the U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel in misdemeanor cases applied only where a defendant was actually imprisoned, not where there was a possibility of imprisonment. The crime to which defendant pled guilty in 1978 was not one which was punishable by more than six months imprisonment, and he was not actually imprisoned. Prior conviction was not constitutionally invalid for enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in appeal from conviction for a fourth driving under the influence offense.

The prior conviction was not constitutionally invalid for enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced appellant as a habitual felony offender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084. Appellant contended that this provision was unconstitutional because it violated the guarantees of equal protection and due process. Appellant claimed that the statute violated the equal protection clause because nothing in the law prevented two defendants with similar or identical criminal records from being treated differently and one could have been classified as a habitual felony offender, while the other might have been sentenced only under sentencing guidelines. The appellate court held the guarantee of equal protection was not violated when prosecutors were given the discretion by law to habitualize only some of the criminals who were eligible, even though their discretion was not bound by statute. The executive branch had the discretion to choose which available punishments to apply. Appellant claimed the statute violated his right to due process because its process was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida) to grant defendant's motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Defendant filed the motion after the state supreme court issued a decision concerning the constitutionality of the county's jury districting system, which defendant had objected to at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a white male, was convicted of first degree murder of a black male. Before the trial defendant moved for a countywide jury venire, claiming that the county's jury districting system was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion, but after defendant was convicted the state supreme court found that the districting system resulted in the systematic exclusion of a significant portion of the county black population from the jury pool for the district in which defendant was tried. Defendant then filed a motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The trial court granted defendant's motion and awarded him a new trial. The state appealed the trial court's decision, and the appellate court reversed it. The appellate court explained that the supreme court decision regarding constitutionality of the districting system merely set a new standard for procedural fairness. The decision did not find that the districting system was unconstitutionally enacted and did not effect a sufficient change of law to warrant granting defendant a new trial. As a result, the appellate court ruled in favor of decisional finality and reversed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision to grant defendant's motion for postconviction relief and award him a new trial on the basis of a state supreme court decision, issued after defendant was convicted, concerning the constitutionality of the county's jury districting system. The appellate court held that the supreme court's decision did not effect a sufficient change of law to warrant granting defendant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court granted summary judgment to appellee based on the statute of limitations, appellants sought review.

The court affirmed grant of summary judgment for appellant son's claim but reversed for appellant parents' claim because, on the facts presented, there was a claim for the special care and maintenance expenses for a disabled child, both before and after the age of majority, the claim was that of appellant parents, not appellant child. As a result of appellee's breach of duty owed to appellant parents, appellant son was born and required a lifetime of special support, for there was no possibility that appellant son would become self-sustaining.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child victim testified at trial that defendant had sexually assaulted him in the woods after luring him into the woods with money. The trial court also admitted defendant's statement made to a police officer who spoke Spanish. Defendant was convicted of sexual battery of a child and was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling that defendant's statement to the police officer was voluntary and admissible despite his complaint that he had a difficult time understanding the Spanish dialect spoken to him. The court also affirmed the trial court's determination that defendant's age was not an element of the crime of sexual battery. Additionally, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling that witnesses were permitted to testify as to what the child victim told them immediately after the incident because their testimony satisfied the hearsay exception of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer made a warrantless arrest of appellee criminal defendants for loitering and prowling after he observed that one defendant appeared to have blood on his hands and shirt, another defendant was trespassing, a person reported to have been in the area was missing, and defendants told inconsistent stories. Defendants moved to suppress the evidence seized following their arrest. The circuit court ordered suppression. On appeal, the court reversed. The appellate court held that probable cause to arrest for loitering and prowling existed where one was found in a place at a time or acting in a manner unusual for law-abiding persons and where such activity was under such circumstances as warranted alarm or concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Because those facts existed, the arrests were lawful and suppression inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

V privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were charged in a separate, pending criminal proceeding with drug transactions and money-laundering activities. The federal criminal trial was ongoing during this state appeal, where petitioners sought to quash a discovery order. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 212.0505 (1987), respondent revenue department had assessed a tax on the unlawful sale, use, consumption, distribution, or manufacture of various illegal drugs. Petitioners filed the instant lawsuit for a declaratory ruling that the statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. Each petitioner admitted his identity but objected to virtually all discovery requests under U.S. Const. amend V and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. After the trial court granted respondent's motions to compel discovery, petitioners sought to quash the order. On appeal, the court denied the certiorari petitions. Because petitioners brought the declaratory action, they had the burden of proof on the issues presented. Thus, the trial court did not err in requiring them to respond to discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioners' request to quash discovery orders in their action for declaratory ruling to invalidate efforts by respondent revenue department to tax illegal drug activities.

The court noted that the state's supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of a prior version of the statute under which appellants were charged. The court then held that an amendment subsequent to the state supreme court's holding did nothing to undermine the statute's constitutionality because the amendment merely clarified the acts that constituted aggravated child abuse. Reviewing the record, the court held that the court properly denied appellants' motions for acquittal because evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to decide appellants' guilt on the charges. However, the court held that the trial court erred in departing from sentencing guidelines when imposing punishment on appellants because the reasons the trial court gave in departing were inherent components of the crime for which appellants were convicted. In so holding, the court found that the evidence did not show that the crimes at issue were so highly extraordinary as to justify an upward departure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' convictions for aggravated child abuse were affirmed, but their sentences were reversed and the cases remanded because the reasons the trial court gave in upwardly departing from sentencing guidelines were legally insufficient to support such a departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trustee entered into a lease with appellee condominium company. After litigation arising over the escalation of rent, a final judgment was issued which declared the lease void. The trial court found that escalation provisions of the lease rendered the lease void upon commencement of the escalator term. Appellant sought review and asserted a variety of errors. On appeal, the court reviewed the lease and observed that an initial rental rate was established and then the rent was adjusted in accordance with the consumer price index. The court found that using the escalator caused the rent to be unconscionable. The court found that the action was within the appropriate limitations period and was not barred under the doctrines of accord and satisfaction. The court further found that there was not an impermissible retroactive application of rent legislation. However, the court found that the escalation clause should have been held void but that the underlying lease with the existing base rental rate should not have been disturbed. The court affirmed as to the escalator clause being unconscionable but reversed as to the voiding of the entire contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the final judgment declaring void a 99-year recreational lease between appellant trustee and appellee condominium company void as to only the escalator clause due to it being unconscionable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was found with cocaine on her person after police entered her home, but the police failed to knock and wait any time before they entered. Appellant, the state, sought review from an order suppressing the cocaine and asserted that the trial court erred when it found the police did not provide prior &quot;due notice of their authority and purpose&quot; before forcibly entering the home. On review, the court found that the search warrant was properly issued on probable cause and that appellee had the cocaine. However, the court noted the police had to &quot;knock and announce&quot; prior to entering unless there was an exception as to violate appellee's right to privacy. The court found that appellant did not present evidence that police reasonably believed the search involved substantially more peril to life, if they announced their purpose and waited for permission to enter. The court indicated that the evidence did not establish a reasonable basis to fear that a gun would be used by anyone in the home, nor that anyone inside was about to destroy evidence or become violent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner's land was affected by down-zoning proposed by government agency appellee. Appellant's property was substantially reduced in value due to the changes and appellant sought issue and filed an action to contest the decision. It was held that while some rules exceeded delegated legislative authority, others did not exceed the agency's grant of rule-making authority. Appellant sought review after his motion for attorney fees was dismissed and he was required to pay an agency's attorney fees and costs. On appeal, the court found that, prior to the zoning changes, appellant was never notified by mail, as required by county rezoning procedure, nor was appellant afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard. There was no question that due process required that appellant, as an affected landowner, was supposed to be given prior notice and an opportunity to be heard before action was taken by the zoning authority. The court examined the legislative enactments and found that there was authority for the re-zoning, but procedural safeguards were not properly implemented. Thus, the court affirmed the authority but reversed with respect to appellant's notice issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Law of July 1, 1987, ch. 87-6, &sect;18-(4), 1987 Fla. Laws (codified as Fla. Stat. ch. 212.059 (1987) (Law) imposed a tax on prime contractors on the sale and use of their services for real property construction contracts signed prior to May 1, 1987, if such service occurred after June 30, 1989. A prior law requiring services be completed before June 30, 1988 was found facially unconstitutional by a precedential advisory opinion as an impairment of contracts. Appellant department sought review after the lower court granted appellees association and company partial summary judgment, finding that the Law facially violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 (1968). Appellant's argument that fact issues precluded summary judgment was rejected, since this was a facial challenge. As to contracts entered into prior to May 1, 1987, but not completed by June 30, 1989, the judgment was in line with the advisory opinion. As to contracts entered into between May 1, 1987, and the statute's effective date, the court found that the Law did not enact a new tax, and contractors had adequate notice. Failure to take judicial notice that post-May 1, 1987 contracts were burdened permissibly was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Martin County (Florida), convicting appellant for lewd and lascivious behavior, sexual performance by a child, promotion of a sexual performance by a child, and possession of child pornography in violation of Fla. Stat. chs. 827.071, 800.04, 827.04, and 847 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for lewd and lascivious behavior, sexual performance and promotion of sexual performance by a child, and possession of child pornography. The court affirmed the judgment as to one count of possession of child pornography. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause of criminal activity to issue the search warrant that produced the child pornography. However, the court held that the seven counts of possession charged in the indictment should have been treated singularly. Moreover, the court ruled that appellant had no constitutional right to possess child pornography. Furthermore, the court affirmed as to the lewd and lascivious behavior count, holding that although Fla. Stat. ch. 827.071(1)(g), which prohibited lewd and lascivious behavior, was overbroad, the statute was narrowly applied in this case. However, the court reversed the charge of sexual performance and promotion because the state failed to provide graphic detail of appellant's conduct. The reversal was without prejudice to the state to refile a proper information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed in part, and remanded the cause. There was sufficient evidence to show appellant's criminal activity, which established probable cause for the issuance of a warrant, and there was no constitutional right to possess child pornography in one's home. Because the statutory requirements for sexual performance were not met in the indictment, the court reversed those convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prohibition against retroactivity required prospective operation of a statute unless the language of that statute explicitly prescribed retrospective operation. Because appellant was convicted in 1979, his licenses could not be revoked on the authority of ch. 493.319(3), which contained no expressed language that it should operate retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that if a statute governed a substantive right or set the bounds of a substantive right, then the statute was within the power of the legislature and therefore constitutional. However, the court noted that appellant should have been afforded an opportunity to amend his complaint to allege compliance with the notice requirement even though there was no compliance at the time the lawsuit was filed. Therefore, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, with instructions to the trial court to allow appellant to amend his complaint in order to allege compliance with Fla.

The trial court granted her motion and she moved for attorney's fees under Fla.

Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction but remanded for a determination of appellant's ability to pay costs. The court held that under the present law, it must remand for a determination of ability to pay pursuant to Mays v. State and Jenkins v. State. Appellee state argued that the law in Florida should be consistent with the federal standard and that Mays and Jenkins should be reassessed. The court certified a question to the supreme court so that it might consider the argument that the federal standard should be applied in Florida. The court certified the following question to the supreme court: Was the imposition of costs against an indigent defendant different than the collection of those costs making the question of ability to pay premature until attempt was made to collect such costs?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, personal representative of decedent, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which ruled in favor of appellee theater in appellant's action for damages following the wrongful death of decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, decedent's personal representative, argued trial court error in instructing the jury on decedent's status when she attempted a turn into appellee theater's parking lot late at night and died when her car went down an embankment. While the court did not err in refusing to rule, as a matter of law, that decedent was an invitee under Fla. Stat. &sect; 95.361(1) (1987), it did err in refusing to submit decedent's status as an invitee to the jury. Moreover, error occurred when the jury was not instructed, based on evidence showing decedent entered appellee's premises as a licensee, on the issue of whether decedent was a public invitee. Further, the trial court abused its discretion in denying a jury view of the accident scene at night, or a nighttime videotape of decedent's route, because daytime views of material conditions were misleading. Error also occurred when appellees' evidence was allowed concerning the absence of subsequent similar accidents, but appellant's discovery request for subsequent accident records was denied. Finally, the jury could properly draw a permissive inference of decedent's intoxication, and be instructed about decedent's restricted driving license.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the order of the hearing officer denying expungement. The court held that the hearing officer erred by relying on the &quot;24 Hour Rule&quot; instead of basing his conclusions on the totality of the credible evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed and remanded the dismissal of appellant paternal grandmother's petition to terminate parental rights, finding that the trial court had erroneously held Fla.

The appellate court noted that, contrary to appellee department's contention, appellant's status as guardian to the children was not as a &quot;stranger,&quot; but rather reflected her position as the children's grandparent. The appellate court then held that unless shown to be clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or wholly unwarranted, Fla. Stat. ch. 39.461(1) (1989), which allowed appellant to seek a judicial determination in terminating parental rights to the children, was constitutional. The appellate court concluded by finding that appellant was entitled to bring the termination petition because the state had a sufficiently compelling interest in the welfare of children to authorize someone with knowledge of facts sufficient to terminate parental rights to bring that issue before a judicial officer even if appellee did not agree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the Circuit Court for Leon County, (Florida) for aggravated child abuse, arguing there were errors in the jury instructions as to child abuse and culpable negligence. Appellant also contested the use of a previous sodomy conviction in Georgia for the calculation of points for sentencing, asserting that the Georgia sodomy statute was facially unconstitutional, and that there was no comparable Florida statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the lower court of aggravated child abuse and his sentence was enhanced based on a prior conviction for sodomy in Georgia. The court affirmed the conviction. The trial court correctly rejected appellant's requested jury instructions as neither child abuse nor culpable negligence was a lesser-included offense of aggravated child abuse. The court also found that Florida had no criminal statute containing elements of an offense analogous to the Georgia sodomy statute under which appellant had been convicted. Therefore, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701(d)(5), no points should have been scored for appellant's Georgia conviction as a prior record. Since the only relevant consideration was whether appellant was under a valid legal restraint, such as probation, which had not been completely served or set aside when he committed the charged offense, the court found no error in the assessment of points for legal constraint. Yet, because the Georgia conviction erroneously was included as an enhancement to his sentence, the sentencing guidelines scoresheet had to be recalculated. Therefore, the sentence was vacated and the cause remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated child abuse, but reversed and remanded as to sentencing because the trial court in calculating appellant's sentence had erroneously included a Georgia sodomy conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation was established under a grant from the state to provide residential rehabilitative and therapeutic services to developmentally disabled children and adults. It purchased property in the city of Apopka in order to develop a group home facility. Because the facility would constitute a group home as defined in a city code, the appellant successfully applied for the required special exception. Following a challenge by appellees, adjoining landowners, the trial court found the City of Apopka, Fla., Zoning Code &sect; 7.3(9)(c)(1) to be unconstitutionally vague and therefore unenforceable. On appeal, the court determined that although the code did not contain specific quantitative guidelines for the determination of the number of occupants of a group home, the operative language had a plain and ordinary meaning that could be readily understood. The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of appellees, and lifted the restriction previously entered prohibiting the appellant from occupying the facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of appellees declaring the city ordinance unconstitutional was reversed because the operative part of the ordinance was plain and unambiguous. Therefore, the court lifted the prohibition entered against the appellants.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, a Florida corporation, filed an emergency verified motion for attachment before judgment based on appellee's belief that appellant was going to move itself out of state within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 76.04(2) and (3), Florida's attachment statute. Appellee's underlying claim against appellant was a suit alleging nonpayment of goods sold to appellant. The trial court issued the writ of attachment without holding an evidentiary hearing. The appellate court found that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the attachment statute. The court held that appellant was not a nonresident corporation within the meaning of the statute, and that appellee failed to produce sufficient evidence indicating that appellant intended to leave the state. As such, the court quashed the writ of attachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state department of revenue challenged an order from the trial court that declared 1983 Fla. Laws ch. 83.339 partially unconstitutional to the extent it provided for a deduction of a service charge from the Gas Tax Collection Trust Fund. The court noted that in matters of constitutional interpretation, the legislature's view of its authority was highly persuasive. In addition, provisions of the Florida Constitution were to be construed so as to effectuate the intent of the framers and the people. However, the court held that an amendment to the state constitution, Fla. Const. art. XII, &sect; 9, could not be read as abolishing the previous constitutional prohibition against use of gas tax funds for purposes other than the servicing of bonds and the construction and maintenance of county roads and bridges. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's finding of partial unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding of the trial court that a statute allowing a service charge on gas tax funds was unconstitutional in part because it violated state constitutional requirements concerning use of gas tax funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When alleged, the crime of rape was defined as sexual intercourse only, and required penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ. Courts were construing oral and anal penetration as violations of another section prohibiting crimes against nature. Thus, the court reversed appellant's conviction on several bases. Fla. Stat. ch. 794.01 was not interpreted to prohibit the unlawful sexual acts other than the penetration of a female victim's sex organ by a male's sex organ. Further, the lower court's use in its jury instruction of the definition of rape constituted a violation of the ex post facto provision of the Florida and U. S. Constitutions. Accordingly, the court reversed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding a due process violation, the court reversed appellant's rape conviction, finding that as the statute existed at the time of his conviction, it was not interpreted to prohibit the unlawful sexual act he was alleged to have committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer was indicted for criminal conspiracy formed to import unlawful drugs into Florida. The Florida Department of Revenue filed a notice of jeopardy assessment against appellant, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 212.050 (1987), and issued a warrant for the collection of the jeopardy tax. After an administrative hearing, the department entered final judgment. The appeals court affirmed and upheld the statute against appellant's constitutional challenges. Since Florida's tax confidentiality provisions provided sufficient protections against self-incrimination itself, appellant could not assert the privilege. The court also reject appellant's' contention that the statute denied him procedural due process. Tax assessors were constitutional officers whose actions were clothed with a presumption of correctness. Appellant did not overcome the presumption because he failed to demonstrate how the assessment irreparably harmed his right to seek review through the administrative process. The statute was a legitimate exercise of the taxing power despite its collateral regulatory purpose, did not violate appellant's right to equal protection, and did not violate U.S. Const. amend IV.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that ch. 752.01 was not an unconstitutional violation of appellant's right to privacy, as the state had a sufficiently compelling interest in the welfare of children to provide for the continuation of relations between children and their grandparents, so long as it was in the children's interests. However, the court held that the record did not show that it was in the children's best interests that appellee be granted such extensive visitation rights, and remanded for the trial court to reconsider the extent of visitation and to make specific findings of fact supporting its visitation order.</SPAN></P>

The court recognized that with respect to cumulative sentences in a single trial, the double jeopardy clause did no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended. Because the Florida Constitution afforded no greater protection than the Federal Constitution, and the crimes for which appellant was convicted were considered by the legislature to be separate offenses, the convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) summary judgment in favor of appellee city in its eminent domain proceeding, arguing numerous grounds of error, including failure to rule on the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 73 and the fact that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an eminent domain proceeding, after entry of final judgment in favor of appellee city and its affirmation on review, when the lower court granted summary judgment for appellee, appellant sought review. The court held that appellant's contention that the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 73 had not been ruled upon was erroneous. Further, the court held that because appellant had elected the benefits of judgment premised on the earlier final judgment, she was deemed to have elected not to pursue an alternative remedy under an inconsistent theory of recovery. Finally, the court held that because there had been a free remedy available to appellant regarding availability of the funds deposited by appellee, the provision that such funds be immediately available for her use had been satisfied and this particular attack on the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 73 was meritless, as were all of appellant's remaining issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that appellant was barred from further remedies by election of remedies, appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of a statute was meritless, and appellant's other claims were likewise without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced under the Habitual Felony Offender Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1987). Appellant challenged his sentence on the grounds that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and that his sentence was not properly imposed under the terms of the statute. The court affirmed because appellant failed to show that other jurisdictions imposed less severe sentences on habitual offenders or that his sentence was particularly harsh. The court held that if notice of appellee state's intent to seek an habitual offender sentence was served on appellant and his attorney as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(3)(b) (1987), the failure to file such notice with the court under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.030(c) was not fatal to an habitual offender enhancement. The court also held that ch. 775.084 did not require written reasons for the imposition of an habitual offender enhancement and that a trial judge could properly imposed an habitual offender sentence by making the required findings in open court.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed an action for damages arising out of the wrongful death of decedent and appellees prevailed at trial.

On review, the court examined whether the trial court erred when it refused to submit to the jury the issue of decedent's status as an invitee on the premises. The court found there was error because the record contained disputed and conflicting evidence concerning the maintenance of the roadway and the jury should have been instructed on the question. The court also found error because the trial court should have instructed the jury as to the issue of whether decedent was a public invitee on the premises. Also, the trial court abused its discretion when it denied a request to permit the jury to view the accident scene under similar conditions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Pasco County (Florida), sentencing him for burglary and possession of burglary tools. The trial court enhanced defendant's sentence as an habitual offender without including findings required by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (Supp. 1988) in a written order or in statements in the record. The state did not serve a notice of enhancement on defendant personally under ch. 775.084.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his enhanced sentence for burglary and possession of burglary tools. The court held that the trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence as an habitual offender without including either in a written order or in statements in the record in open court the findings required by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (Supp. 1988). The court remanded the case for the trial court to either make the requisite findings or, if the record did not support such findings, to vacate the habitual offender sentence. The court also reviewed the enhancement of defendant's sentence as a habitual offender pursuant to ch. 775.084 given the failure of the state to serve defendant personally with the requisite notice of enhancement. The court noted that the statute required notice to be served on defendant and his attorney. However, the court found that defendant's attorney was served with notice, defendant had knowledge of the notice, and a response was prepared and made on behalf of defendant. Therefore, the sentence was not reversible on the notice provision of ch. 775.084.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence as an habitual offender without including either in a written order or in statements in the record the findings required by statute. A response was submitted by the defense because of notice served on counsel, and this made the notice sufficient.</SPAN></P>

At the hearing on appellee's motion to dismiss, the trial court granted the motion and found the statute unconstitutional on its face because it made it a crime for any person to &quot;use&quot; a vessel while under the influence regardless of the fact that the person may only have been a passenger on the vessel. The court reversed. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 327.02(18) (1987), &quot;operate&quot; was defined to mean &quot;navigate or otherwise use a vessel.&quot; This section was amended to define &quot;operate&quot; to mean that a person was in the actual physical control of a vessel.

The reviewing court held that it was clear that a defendant, whether he be indigent or not, was entitled to adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the imposition of costs. Later, upon enforcement, he may not be forced to pay those costs if he could show an inability to pay them. Hence, defendant was entitled to adequate notice and a hearing before the costs were imposed upon him. Finally, the reviewing court found merit in the state's contention that the court was without authority to impose community service in lieu of costs under Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455. Accordingly, the imposition of costs and community control was quashed and the case was remanded for the reimposition of costs under all three sections after adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard was given.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution then sought review of the lower court's imposition of defendant's mitigated sentence. The court held that the lower court's failure to offer written or oral reasons for its downward departure from the sentencing guidelines in sentencing defendant was in error, and reversed for sentencing within the guidelines, entry of written reasons for the departure, or for the lower court to permit defendant to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review on his classification as a habitual offender and his enhanced sentence under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statute on grounds of equal protection, claiming that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 created inequitable classes because it only applied to those whose prior offenses were committed within the state. Under substantive due process, the test was whether the statute bore a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective and was not discriminatory, arbitrary, capricious or oppressive. Habitual offender statutes were the means to achieve the stated goal of protecting the citizens of Florida by the incarceration of career criminals. The court held that the habitual offender statute served a legitimate state interest by utilizing a means reasonably related to achieve the intended purpose of the state. Appellant also argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, maintaining that the habitual offender statute set up no method to determine who should be habitualized. The court held that the statute was not so vague that it offended principles of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed where the court found that Florida Habitual Offender Statute was constitutional as it served a legitimate state interest by utilizing a means reasonably related to achieve the intended purpose of the state in protecting the citizens of Florida by the incarceration of career criminals. The court further found that the statute was not so vague that it offended principles of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the prosecution in a criminal case, challenged an order of the Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida), granting appellee's motion for a mitigated sentence and reducing appellee's sentence after appellant refused to move for a sentence reduction pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the prosecution in a criminal case, appealed an order granting appellee's motion for a mitigated sentence. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in reducing appellee's sentence because the record did not show that appellant's refusal to move for a sentence reduction pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(4) constituted bad faith or overreaching. Appellee cross-appealed, arguing that his sentence should have been reduced or mitigated to the same sentence as that imposed on a codefendant. The court found no merit in appellee's argument. However, the court agreed with appellant's contention. Specifically, the court found that appellant had not acted in bad faith or overreached by refusing to move for a mitigated sentence for appellee while seeking such a sentence for appellee's codefendant. Absent a showing of bad faith or overreaching by appellant, the trial court lacked authority to grant appellee's motion for a sentence reduction based on his claim of substantial assistance. Accordingly, the court reversed and remanded for the trial court to sentence appellee in accordance with ch. 893.135.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order mitigating appellee's sentence was reversed, and the cause was remanded. Appellee was not entitled to a mitigated sentence after appellant refused to move for a sentence reduction, because absent bad faith or prosecutorial overreaching, appellant had unbridled discretion as to requesting a sentence reduction in return for appellee's substantial assistance.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 380.06(6)(a) (1983), appellant company filed its application with the city for approval for development of 62 acres of land. A short-term traffic study showed that an intersection had been improved &quot;at grade&quot; as much as possible, and that there was no capacity for additional development on the island given the current state of the intersection. As a result, appellant's application was denied with conditions, which was proof by appellant of funding commitments for roadway improvements, including the construction of an overpass at the intersection. The application for Phase I was approved, and Phase II was denied. The judgment of the Commission was affirmed. The court held that while an overpass would ease traffic congestion at the intersection, appellant did not prove that its proposed overpass would accomplish that end, or even be technically feasible. Because competent substantial evidence supported the finding of the hearing officer that appellant failed to prove the adequacy of its proposed curative measure, the application was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees filed a complaint for damages they incurred as the result of an unauthorized sale of their stock by appellant, their stockbroker, who was employed by appellant company. Appellees sent appellants a demand for settlement in the amount of $ 7,500. Appellants rejected the opportunity to settle and the case went to trial. The jury awarded appellees a total of $ 38,250 in compensatory and punitive damages. Additionally, the trial court awarded $ 29,520 in attorney's fees to appellees pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061 (1987). On appeal, the court rejected appellants' contention that the legislature unconstitutionally infringed on the supreme court's exclusive rule-making authority through its enactment of Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061. Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061(2) and (3) created substantive rights. However, the court agreed with appellants that the trial court incorrectly calculated the amount of the attorney's fee award. The contract between appellees and their attorney provided for the attorney to be paid 40 percent of any gross recovery. The court remanded with directions to amend the order on attorney's fees to reflect an award of $ 15,653.60.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessors and appellee tenants sought review from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which required rent to be paid into the registry of the court. The main issues on appeal called into question the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4)(a) (1987) and the standing of the parties under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were lessors and appellees were an individual condominium owner who had an individual lease, a condominium association, and a condominium tenant's organization, which entered into various contracts with appellant lessors. An initial complaint was filed to seek a determination of whether appellee condominium tenants organization had certain powers and damages were alleged. Upon motion of appellee lessees and without an evidentiary hearing, the trial court entered an order requiring rent to be paid into the registry of the court. Appellants sought review. On appeal, the court focused on whether appellees had standing and the constitutionality of the rent statute. The court found that appellees, association and unit owner, qualified under Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) (1987) with respect to obligations of appellant under the lease. However, the court found that appellee condominium tenants organization did not have standing under the statute as it was neither a unit owner nor a condominium association. The court also found that the statute at issue which required the rent deposit was facially constitutional. The court affirmed but remanded as to the standing issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision which required rent to be paid into the registry of the court because the rent regulation statute at issue was facially constitutional and appellees, individual condominium owner and condominium association, had standing thereunder. However, a tenant's organization which was neither a unit owner nor a condominium association, did not come within the ambit of the condominium statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action arising out of an automobile accident, plaintiffs, who were involved in the accident, contended that defendants, an automobile lessor and others under a long term automobile lease, were liable under the Florida Dangerous Instrumentality Doctrine. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9) was enacted to limit the liability of lessors under the dangerous instrumentality doctrine. Thus, defendants were exempted from insuring the vehicle in accordance with ch. 324.021(9) because the lease was for a year or longer. The court further upheld the constitutionality of ch. 324.021(9), finding that it did not limit access to the courts in violation of Fla. Const., art. I, &sect; 21. Finally, the court held that ch. 324.021(9) did not violate defendants' due process and equal protection rights because the classification pertaining to long-term leases was rational.</SPAN></P>

The court employed a two-prong approach to assess both procedural and substantive unconscionability. The court held that there was procedural unconscionability because appellees lacked any meaningful choice but to pay the increased rent. In holding that the rent increases were not substantively unconscionable, the court rejected appellees' claim that unreasonable rents were sufficient to meet the substantive unconscionability test.

The state filed a petition for a writ of prohibition/writ of certiorari, seeking an order to compel the trial court to conduct a penalty phase proceeding at which evidence was presented to an advisory jury. The court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141 permitted the state and defendant to present evidence of an aggravating or mitigating nature during the penalty phase. In addition, the statute stated that the trial court had the discretion to forgo an advisory jury if defendant waived it. Lastly, the court noted that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.260 specified that defendant could only waive trial by jury with the consent of the state. Because the state did not consent to waiver of the advisory jury, and was permitted to present evidence, the trial court improperly discharged the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for obstruction of a law officer in the execution of his legal duties without offering or doing violence to such officer, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.02 (1987). Appellant had refused to stop yelling and cursing at police while they were arresting drug dealers. She was arrested when an officer asked her to leave and she refused. Appellant unsuccessfully moved to suppress statements that she made to the officers and evidence of drugs found in a search incident to her arrest, arguing that the obstruction of an officer statute was overbroad and unconstitutionally infringed on her right to free speech. The court held that the statute did not impermissibly prohibit or proscribe protected free speech under the guise of supposed interference with an officer. In particular, the statute met the Broadrick, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973), overbreadth test. Although a person's speech might at times be implicated incidentally in the enforcement of the statute, its plainly legitimate sweep was to reach conduct that physically obstructed or opposed an officer in the performance of lawful duties.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 827.071(5) (1987), were severable from the rest of the statute, dismissal of information against defendant on grounds that statute was overbroad was reversed. Defendant was charged with possession of child pornography videotape. The trial court found that the statutory definition of &quot;sexual conduct&quot; by a child was substantially overbroad and dismissed the charges against defendant. The state appealed. The reviewing court reversed and remanded, holding that although the statute was overbroad in some of its definitions of what constituted sexual conduct by a child, other definitions were not overbroad. However, the overbroad definitions were severable from the rest of the statute because the sections remaining could accomplish the legislative intent without the invalid provisions. The statute remained complete in itself after the invalid provisions were stricken.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought a negligence action against appellee doctor, who worked for appellee county. The trial court dismissed the action. Appellant contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9)(a), which addressed waiver of sovereign immunity in tort actions, was not a bar to a claim against a government employee where appellee doctor was covered by privately purchased liability insurance. Appellant argued that appellee doctor had waived his statutory immunity by purchasing liability insurance. The court disagreed and affirmed, holding that in the absence of a governing statute, the private purchase of liability insurance by an employee of a political subdivision of the state was not a waiver of the employee's statutory immunity from tort claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court, dismissing appellant's negligence action against appellee doctor, was affirmed because the claim was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, notwithstanding appellee's private purchase of liability insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of orders of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), dismissing one case against appellee on the basis that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged in two separate cases with keeping a house of ill fame in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.01 (1987). The trial court dismissed one case, ruling that ch. 796.01 was unconstitutionally vague, and dismissed the other case upon ruling that appellee had been deprived of a speedy trial. The state appealed the dismissals, and the court reversed the orders. The court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 796.01 (1987) was not unconstitutionally vague and that appellee had not demonstrated a violation of his right to a speedy trial so as to require a dismissal. The court found that appellee had presented no evidence to establish actual prejudice as a result of the state's delay in filing the information or in disclosing its discovery and that he had not argued that the state had acted in bad faith. Thus, the court held that appellee's motion to discharge had been improperly granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the order that dismissed the information against defendants. Defendants were charged with keeping a house of ill fame in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.01 (1987). The court held that the terms prostitution and lewdness were not unconstitutionally vague as used in the statute because both terms were both defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(1) (1987). The court expressed doubt concerning the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.01 (1987) because it made ill fame an undefined essential element of a crime, but the court did not invalidate the statute because the state supreme court had repeatedly enforced it. The court held that the statute was valid in order to allow the supreme court to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and upheld the validity of the amendment. Appellant challenged the order, and the court affirmed the summary judgment. The court found that the amendment did not interfere or conflict with activities that were exclusively within the state's power, but instead spoke to activities that were exclusively or concurrently within appellee's power, and therefore the amendment was not preempted by state laws regarding beach restoration. The court further held that the overbreadth doctrine was not applicable because appellant's U.S. Const. amend. I rights were not in jeopardy and that the amendment was not vague when the ordinary meaning and common understanding of the terms were applied.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 856.04 (1987), which subjected all males who willfully withheld support from their wives or children to punishment as third degree felons.

The trial court ruled that there was no justiciable controversy because appellant's petition for habeas corpus was pending. During the pendency of the appeal, the petition for habeas was granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of a final judgment of the Circuit Court, Alachua County (Florida), which granted appellee county's motions for partial summary judgment and involuntary dismissal of appellants' complaint, which challenged a land use amendment to appellee's comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners owned real property in an environmentally sensitive area of appellee county. Appellee enacted land use regulations that restricted appellants' use of their property, by amending the appellee's comprehensive plan (plan). The amendments were challenged as beyond the police powers of appellee, or, as an enactment of those powers that required compensation. The trial court granted partial summary judgment for appellee, and dismissed part of the complaint, finding that the challenge was mooted by a subsequent amendment to the plan. On review, the court affirmed, holding that appellants' challenge to the plan was facial in nature, and further amendment to the plan made the challenge moot. Because no individual appellant had applied for or been denied a permit under the amendment, the amendment also allowed appellants most existing uses of their property. As appellants could not demonstrate that they had been denied all or most of the beneficial uses of the property, no compensable taking had occurred. Finally, the court held that the plan and its amendments properly addressed conservation concerns and were a proper use of appellee's police powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment and involuntary dismissal of appellants' claims, holding that the challenged land use amendments and regulations of appellee county's comprehensive plan were a valid exercise of appellee's police power, and did not, on their face, constitute a compensable taking. The court held that appellants failed to show that they were denied all or most beneficial uses of their property.</SPAN></P>
