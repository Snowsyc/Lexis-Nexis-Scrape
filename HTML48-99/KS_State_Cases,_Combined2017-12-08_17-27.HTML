</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed a class action against a law firm. Thereafter, the company filed an affidavit requesting that the judge disqualify himself pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-311d, et seq. (Supp. 1971). Specifically, the company argued that the judge expressed such attitudes that would have prevented the company from receiving a fair trial. The judge argued that the applicable statute did not serve as an automatic disqualification, and that the affidavit submitted by the company was insufficient to require the judge's disqualification. The court agreed that &sect; 20-311d, et seq. (Supp. 1971) did not require automatic disqualification, rather it served as a basis for conducting a hearing to determine whether the pleadings contained sufficient allegations to warrant disqualification. The court concluded that the affidavit revealed sufficient information that constituted fair support for the belief that a fair trial could not have been obtained under the circumstances. Therefore, the affidavit filed by the company was legally sufficient to require disqualification.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court should have considered the post-trial evidence submitted because it was relevant; (2) the utility was not entitled to a reduction in the assessment of its property for economic obsolescence; (3) appellees gave consideration to all factors enumerated in Kan. Stat.

The officers seized a quantity of gambling equipment and paraphernalia and the Attorney General's office caused subpoenas to be served commanding said persons to appear and testify and produce certain materials pertaining to the operation of the clubs. The clubs protested and the judge issued a temporary restraining order that the State be temporarily and permanently enjoined from issuing subpoenas, conducting inquisitions, or conducting other proceedings against the clubs. The court found that the restraining order was void and it was directed to be set aside. The court held that the district courts could not prevent the Attorney General and the County Attorney from performing the duties required of them by statute. The court held that mandamus was the proper remedy where the essential purpose of the proceeding was to obtain an authoritative interpretation of the law for the guidance of public officials in their administration of the public business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a natural gas company, sought review of an order of the Clay District Court (Kansas), which entered judgment in favor of defendant, a county's treasurer. The company's action to recover taxes paid under protest originally named several county tax officials, the Kansas Director of Property Valuation, the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals, and the Board's members, but those defendants were dismissed prior to the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company operated a gas line that ran across several counties. Acting pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1404, the Director assessed the company's property and allocated part of the assessment to each county where the company had property. The company's appeal to the Board, pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-2426 (1969 Supp.), was denied. The company appealed to a district court, also pursuant to &sect; 74-2426. The company paid the taxes due the county at issue under protest, then filed suit under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-2005 to recover the protested tax. On appeal, the court held that because the property was assessed on a statewide basis, the method of review outlined in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-2426 (1969 Supp.) was exclusive. Section 74-2426 did not violate either Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court's interpretation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-2005 did not pose an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. However, the trial court erred when it dismissed the county officials from the action. Even if not necessary parties, they were at least proper parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment so far as it held that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the validity of the assessment of the company's property made by the Director and upheld by the Board. The court reversed the judgment so far as it dismissed county officials from the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that his attorneys at the trial and on direct appeal were incompetent, ineffective, and inadequate, resulting in a denial of effective assistance of counsel, that he should not have been sentenced under the Habitual Criminal Act, and that the severity of the sentence was excessive. In affirming the denial of the petition, the court held that the inmate had retained his attorneys on his own and no complaint was made by him until after the trial was completed and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. With regard to his enhanced sentenced, the post-conviction remedy could not be used as a second appeal to re-examine questions raised and determined adversely to the inmate on direct appeal. Finally, considering that the inmate was an habitual criminal with a long history of criminal acts, the trial court did not impose a sentence so disproportionate to the offense to the inmate's past history of crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad company timely filed its state income returns with the director for the years in question and paid the tax due. Prior to the expiration of four years from the date of filing each of the returns, the railroad company filed its amended returns for those years. Its net taxable income was computed in accordance with the provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3279. The amended returns showed no tax liability for the years in question. The railroad company filed an application for refund pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3230. The application for refund was denied by the director. Upon appeal, the state board of tax appeals and the district court denied the application. On review, the court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3290 provided sufficient basic standards and reasonably definite policy for its administration and was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Nothing in either the state or federal constitutions required that the same methods be used for valuing all types of property or businesses.

The elector alleged that the amendments violated Kan. Const. art. 14, &sect; 1. One of the amendments was rejected by the electors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Kan. Const. art. 14, &sect; 1, only three proposed amendments to the constitution could be submitted to the electors in the same election and each was required to be submitted so the electors could vote on it separately. The elector argued that the two amendments approved by the electors had actually involved a number of separate amendments and were, therefore, invalid. The court held that the test was whether the alleged amendments had different objects and purposes in view, or related to more than one subject and had at least two distinct and separate purposes not dependent upon or connected with each other. Applying this test, the court held that an amendment that dealt with two different articles of the constitution, extended the terms of certain members of the executive department, imposed term limits, eliminated the executive offices of treasurer and auditor, and revised the provisions dealing with the militia was comprised of at least three separate amendments and was invalid. The court upheld the second amendment, which, although making a number of changes in the existing process for amending or revising the constitution, dealt only with that subject.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 21-107b as an habitual criminal because he had three prior felony convictions. He argued that the sentence was illegal because he was not represented by counsel in one of the cases used to enhance his sentence. The court held that the convict's sentence was proper because &sect; 21-107b only required two prior felony convictions. The court noted that the journal entry in the case challenged by the convict showed that the trial court had fully advised him of his right to counsel, that he intelligently and understandingly waived his right to counsel in writing, and that the trial court found that the appointment of counsel over his objection would not be to his advantage as required by Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-1304 (1949) (repealed). The court held that a waiver of the right to counsel was binding on an accused in both state and federal courts. The court held that the convict was not entitled to a plenary hearing and the appointment of counsel on his Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507 motion because it failed to present a substantial question of law or a triable issue of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, who was the claimant's husband, was employed as a pharmacist by appellee employer, and he died from a heart attack approximately one and one-half hours after he left the drug store. The claimant sought compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and the examiner entered an award in her favor, which was sustained by the director. The district court denied all compensation because there was no causal relationship between the decedent's employment and the coronary occlusion that caused his death. The claimant appealed, but the court affirmed the judgment. Whether the decedent's work on the day in question was more than his usual work was entirely irrelevant in light of the district court's findings. The district court was empowered, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-556, to hear the matter de novo and to substitute its judgment for that of the director, and in doing so, the district court did not exercise administrative functions in violation of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

A detective who noticed debris from the burglary scene realized that the occupants of the car had a white substance on their shoes, looked through the windows of the car, and found the stolen property. On appeal from defendant's subsequent larceny conviction, the court held that even though a search warrant that recited only that officers believed that property connected with a crime was contained within the car was invalid because it lacked specificity, the search was not illegal because the officers had reasonable cause to search the car based upon their observation of stolen property in plain view.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject real estate, consisting of two separately described tracts, was conveyed by warranty deed to grantees, husband and wife.

The trial court found that the deed, at the time of its execution and delivery, created a tenancy in common; that the rights of the grantees became vested upon the delivery of the deed in question; and that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58-2270 (Supp. 1969) was unconstitutional and invalid because its effect was to impair the obligation of contracts. The administrator appealed and the court held that the rights of appellees in the subject property became vested on the death of the grantee husband. At that time appellees succeeded to a vested right in the grantee husband's undivided one-half interest as a tenant in common.

The worker argued the district court, on appeal in a workmen's compensation case, had authority only to determine whether the director's findings of fact were erroneous and whether the director's action was within the scope of his authority. The court found the sole question involved in the appeal was whether Kan. Stat.

The court noted that the legislature, acting in pursuance of the police power of the State, was empowered to adopt measures in furtherance of the public welfare and its enactments in that area were not to have been judicially curtailed where they reasonably related to the legitimate ends sought to have been accomplished. Classifications honestly designed to protect the public interest against evils which might have occurred were to have been upheld unless they were unreasonable, arbitrary, or oppressive. The classifications contained in &sect; 21-2611 were crimes of violence, thus logic prohibited possession of a weapon by an individual who committed such an offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger appealed a judgment of the Sedgwick County District Court, Division No. 2 (Kansas), which held for defendant driver in the passenger's negligence action for damages for injuries sustained by the passenger as a result of a collision that occurred while she was riding in the driver's car. The district court found no evidence that the driver was wantonly and grossly negligent under the guest statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-122b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger claimed that &sect; 8-122b was invalid because its title contravened Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 by not clearly expressing the subject of &sect; 8-122b. The purpose of &sect; 8-122b was to limit the liability of a host owner or driver of an automobile. Thus, although the owner or operator was the person primarily affected by &sect; 8-122b, the title was not sufficiently broad to include legislation concerning the right of a guest. The court held that &sect; 8-122b affected guests and owners or operators of vehicles. It dealt with each class's natural connection to each other. Its enactment diminished both the rights of the former and the liabilities of the latter and illustrated that their rights and liabilities were correlative. In titling &sect; 8-122b, it was irrelevant which class of persons was mentioned first. Both classes were mentioned in the title, and the subject of &sect; 8-122b was clearly expressed in the title as constitutionally required under Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. Finally, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-122b did not violate the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 18 because it was a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The owners complained that tax due the school district and the State of Kansas was illegal and void because the various counties applied unequal rates of assessment of property within the same taxing unit or district. Defendants, the school district, a county clerk, and a board of county commissioners, filed motions to dismiss. The district court dismissed the action on the basis the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. On appeal, the court determined that the issue was whether or not the petition stated claims upon which relief could be granted. The court affirmed the judgment. The owners' complaint that assessing officials in other counties did not comply with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1439 and assess property at 30 percent of justifiable value, or that defendant, the Director of Property Valuation for the State of Kansas, did not face up to his statutory duties, did not furnish the basis for granting relief in a protest action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basic proration order under attack was originally adopted by the Commission in 1944. Under it, production allowables for 3,955 wells in the field had been determined under an &quot;adjusted deliver-ability formula.&quot; The owner argued that this formula was not permitting certain wells to produce proportionately with other wells, thus evidencing the need for a special allowable or &quot;rateable allowable.&quot; The court found that the method used by the owner to arrive at the sample &quot;rateable allowables&quot; failed to consider several important factors, including the variances in abandonment pressure, the differing drainage area of the wells, the production imbalance of the wells, and the development histories of the studied well and its offsets. The court rejected the owner's claim that the basic proration order deprived it of due process of law. The basic proration order had already been held to comply with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-703; it was the owner's own proposed formula that did not comply with the statutory factors. The owner was not deprived of a remedy because it was not foreclosed from demonstrating a need to change the basic order in the future.</SPAN></P>

A jury prescribed a punishment of life imprisonment. Defendant's motion for a new trial was argued and overruled, and his appeal was dismissed on motion by the State.

R. 8(d) was amended to permit an application for an extension of time due to &quot;excusable neglect.&quot; The trial court found no showing in the record that defendant intentionally waived his right to perfect his direct appeal and have his case heard on the merits. On appeal, defendant mainly argued that denial of his motion for a change of venue filed before commencement of his trial on first degree kidnapping prevented him from having a fair trial. The court held that because defendant had been precluded on direct appeal from a review of alleged trial errors affecting his constitutional rights because of an appellate procedural rule that was since amended, exceptional circumstances existed within the purview of Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 121(c)(3) so as to entitle defendant to have review of alleged trial errors having a constitutional basis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of attempted statutory rape and of grand larceny, and took no appeal. Ten years later, he filed a motion to set aside his sentence under &sect; 60-1507, based on possible infringement of his constitutional rights. The trial court denied the motion, and he appealed, alleging that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a continuance of his motion based on the absence of a material witness and the nonavailability of a trial transcript. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that the record showed that petitioner's counsel at the &sect; 60-1507 proceeding had been aware of the fact that no trial transcript was available. It noted that petitioner had not alleged specific errors in the criminal proceeding, but only possible infringements of his constitutional rights, and that he had not previously asserted the issue because he had not taken a direct appeal. The court held that a &sect; 60-1507 proceeding could not be used as a substitute for the direct appeal of trial errors.

When the Board refused to adopt or submit the proposed ordinance to the electorate, the Attorney General filed an action in mandamus, which was denied on the ground of laches. After an examination of all of the contracts entered into by the Board prior to the voters' petition, the court determined that the Board had been contractually bound on the project for at least two years prior to the petition.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6776 (1965) for a portion of the balance of bonded indebtedness of a disorganized school district that was divided between the two districts. District 255 cross-appealed the amount of the payment it recovered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A school district was disorganized, and its facilities and students were divided between Districts 254 and 255. District 255 received a high school building formerly in the disorganized district, on which an outstanding bonded indebtedness of $ 246,000 remained. District 255 brought an action under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6776 (1968) to recover an equitable portion of the balance due on the building's indebtedness from District 254. The court rejected District 254's contention that the &quot;equitable considerations&quot; considered under &sect; 72-6776 in determining the amount to which District 255 was entitled were so vague as to render the statute unconstitutional. Precedent and statutes adequately demonstrated that the statutory equitable considerations were commonly used by the legislature and the court in resolving issues between school districts. The trial court weighed all of the material equitable considerations in determining the share of the bond obligations allocable to District 254. However, it erred in failing to provide for the disbursement of benefits for certain taxpayers of the disorganized district who had been detached to District 255, and the judgment was modified accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions before the court were whether a confession made by defendant was properly admitted into evidence before the jury in the trial of the criminal action, and whether the error, if any, was waived by defendant's failure to take an appeal from the conviction. The court held that the State had not, as a matter of law, met its burden to show that defendant intentionally relinquished or abandoned a known right or privilege to appeal. There was no evidence that the specific issue concerning the lack of a special hearing was raised during the trial, in the motion for a new trial, or discussed with defendant. There was no showing that defendant was informed that he had been denied due process of law due to the inadequacy of the determination of the voluntary nature of his confession. Thus, it could not be said that he made an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. Defendant argued that his determination not to appeal was based upon the fear that his wife would have been drawn into the second trial as a co-defendant. Thus, the court held that defendant had not voluntarily waived his right to a review of constitutional errors on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Any challenges as to assessments made after May would not be heard until the next year. The court found that all that was required was that a hearing be held, not that it be as timely as a taxpayer would require. Further, the court rejected the taxpayer's contention that the timing resulted in unequal taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with kidnapping in the first degree, kidnapping in the second degree, and forcible rape. Defendant entered into a plea bargain in which the second kidnapping charge was dropped, and he voluntarily pled guilty to the remaining charges. Defendant's counsel made a plea that a sentence of death not be imposed, and the State announced that it did not seek the death penalty. Defendant was sentenced to life confinement on the kidnapping charge and sentenced concurrently on the rape charge. Defendant argued that his plea of guilty was coerced and that no appeal was taken because he was told by his counsel that if an appeal were successful, the court would impose the death penalty. The court rejected defendant's argument that the first-degree kidnapping statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-449, was unconstitutional as applied to the case. The fact that rape supplied the element of bodily harm required for proof of first-degree kidnapping did not mean that defendant was twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. The court held that defendant's plea was voluntary. Defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because there was not the slightest hint of &quot;coercion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The peddler, who sold ice cream from his truck, sought injunctive relief, arguing that the ordinance was invalid. The trial court denied the relief. The court reversed the judgment and held that the ordinance was void because the absolute prohibition of legitimate enterprises was arbitrary and unreasonable, even though businesses engaged in peddling could have been controlled by reasonable regulations. The city had ample power to regulate hucksters and peddlers without prohibition. The court noted that the peddler's truck, going as slow as it did, was not dangerous, and if the children in the streets of residential districts were to have been protected, the regulation had to have been applied to all those using vehicles on the street, not just peddlers. The court noted that the reasonableness of an ordinance involved a determination as to whether it was for the public benefit, and whether the means adopted to produce the public benefit were reasonably necessary to accomplish that purpose and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and release from imprisonment in the state reformatory as a result of the revocation of his parole by the state board of probation and parole. The board denied petitioner's request to have his attorney present at the hearing. The writ was duly issued and the trial court, after a hearing, rendered judgment dissolving the writ and ordering petitioner to the custody of the Superintendent. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-2226 et seq. did not contemplate that a parolee was entitled to have counsel present and appear with him as a matter of right at a revocation hearing. That was not to say that a prisoner was precluded from having counsel. However, counsel's arguments and statements in his client's behalf had to be submitted in writing for the board's consideration, together with an affidavit. The matter of whether a prisoner was a good risk for release on parole was a disciplinary matter which was to be left in the hands of those charged with the responsibility for deciding the question.

Counts II and III of the petition alleged appellees unlawfully adopted charter ordinances concerning salaries and pensions. On appeal, the taxpayers argued that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaint against appellees. Upon review, the court found the taxpayers' argument without merit. The fact that the taxpayers failed to state a claim in any of the three counts in their petition, upon which relief could have been granted, compelled an affirmance of the trial court's dismissal of the action. In addition, none of the taxpayers had any special interest as a private citizen or taxpayer that was not enjoyed by the public generally. Because the taxpayers neither alleged nor made any claim of interest other than that of the whole community, they had no capacity to maintain an action in quo warranto under the provisions of Kan.

According to the court, the applicant had a significant interest at stake in the board's action on her license application. The court noted that procedural due process required that the applicant be given notice and an opportunity for a hearing before a license could be denied on the ground of personal unfitness. The court also found that the board erred in failing to set forth in full the facts upon which its decision was based.

The court held that the review by the trial court of the juvenile court judgment was de novo, as was the court's review, which required the trial court to review the evidence that supported the requirements for the juvenile to waive its jurisdiction over defendant. The court further held that there was sufficient substantial evidence to support the juvenile court's waiver based on the prior adjudications of defendant with different sanctions imposed.

Furthermore, the court found no merit to petitioner's claim that his plea of guilty to the offense of robbery in the first degree was involuntary and coerced because of the possibility that the county attorney would seek to invoke the provisions of the habitual criminal act, Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, petroleum corporations and other corporations, appealed a judgment of the Stevens District Court (Kansas) that dismissed their action that sought to enjoin defendants, the County Clerk of Stevens County, the Director of Property Valuation of the State of Kansas, and the County Treasurer of Stevens County, from enforcing and effectuating an order of the Director. An issue was the trial court's jurisdiction to decide the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petroleum corporations argued that there was jurisdiction under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-907, which allowed judicial injunctive relief to enjoin the illegal levy of any tax, charge, or assessment, the collection of those, or any proceeding to enforce those. The petition alleged that the order of the Director was contrary to, and not in compliance with, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1404, that the statute did not authorize an added tax, and that there could be no increase in the assessed valuation of taxable property without a corresponding increase in the County's tax levy. The court ruled that the petition raised a question of an illegal tax levy where the taxing authorities were proceeding allegedly contrary to the statute, and the trial court had jurisdiction and authority to decide the issue under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-907(a). Where a petition in a private taxpayer action sought merely to reduce or increase taxes by a mandatory injunction because of a governmental change in the valuation on other property, there was no jurisdiction, but there was jurisdiction where there was an action of an administrative official or board taken without authority. Therefore, the court reversed.</SPAN></P>

Prior to filing the action, and as a part of an investigation, the attorney general subpoenaed certain sales employees of the corporations to appear and testify at an inquisition pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-153. The witnesses were granted immunity from prosecution and were required to answer questions propounded to them. Appellants filed in the trial court motions to suppress the inquisition statements taken of the various witnesses and their use by the attorney general in any way in the trial of the case. The trial court denied the motion to suppress.

Defendant admitted having a gun to the parole officer again at a courthouse, and, later, on the way to a residence where the gun was found defendant was given Miranda warnings by the police, after which defendant admitted having had the gun again. The court held that Miranda put a duty on state parole officers when they were investigating the commission of fresh or new felonies by parolees to comply with Miranda for the incriminating statements they elicited from those parolees to be admissible as evidence in the prosecution of new offenses. The court also held that where a confession was obtained illegally in violation of Miranda subsequent confessions however extracted were likewise inadmissible unless the State demonstrated convincingly that there was no connection with the prior illegal confession.

The bank argued that &sect; 79-3109's classifying of intangible personal property differently from tangible property was discriminatory and violated Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1 (1924), as tangible property was taxed at only 30 percent of its fair or justifiable value. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's decision that no constitutional violation had occurred. The court rejected the bank's argument that art 11, &sect; 1, required property within a class to be assessed uniformly with all of a taxpayer's other taxable property. Although the 1924 constitutional amendment employed the verb &quot;taxed&quot; rather than the noun &quot;assessment,&quot; it permitted &quot;other evidences of debt,&quot; such as stocks, to be classified and taxed uniformly within a class at five mills on the dollar, based on actual value, but remain otherwise exempt from taxation. The terms &quot;assessment&quot; and &quot;taxation&quot; were construed as being synonymous.</SPAN></P>

The request was denied, and defendant pleaded guilty to both charges. He was convicted and the trial court imposed the death penalty. He sought review. The court affirmed. It found that defendant waived his right to challenge the denial of change of venue when he entered his guilty pleas because the effect of a guilty plea was to waive any irregularities that proceeded the plea. Similarly, defendant's contention that co-defendant's confession was illegally obtained was also waived when defendant entered his plea. Furthermore, the confession was only admitted during the sentencing portion after defendant had already admitted his guilt. Photographs of the victim were properly admitted during the sentencing phase because they corroborated co-defendant's confession and because the photographs were relevant and material to the matters at issue. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed the death penalty because when a guilty plea was entered, Kan. Stat.

The trial court quashed service on the retailer and dismissed all the suits for lack of jurisdiction. Appellants sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that there had to be something more in &quot;product hazard&quot; cases than a foreseeable injury from the product to fulfill the minimum contact requirement of due process. In this case, there was no jurisdiction over the retailer because the retailer had never been qualified to do business in Kansas. It had never maintained a place of business or a point of distribution, owned or used real or personal property, delivered merchandise to or performed services for residents in Kansas. The retailer never solicited business or performed services within Kansas and products sold or serviced by it were not consumed or used in Kansas in the ordinary course of trade and use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over a period of time, the mother-in-law loaned money to the son-in-law so that he could continue his education within the forum state.

When the mother-in-law brought her action to recover the debt, the son-in-law failed to respond and a default judgment was entered against him. In his motion to set aside the default judgment and dismiss the case, the son-in-law contended that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction because the loan did not amount to a &quot;transaction of business&quot; for the purposes of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-308(b)(1). In reversing the dismissal on appeal, the court held that &sect; 60-308(b)(1) could be constitutionally retroactively applied to the son-in-law because &sect; 60-308(b)(1) was remedial in character and did not deprive him of a vested right. The court also found that the loan constituted a &quot;transaction of business&quot; even though it was not commercial in nature because the son-in-law invoked the benefits of the forum state in the divorce proceeding and the obligation to repay the debt was to be performed in the forum state.</SPAN></P>

The landowners requested an injunction against the district's proposed method of financing an allegedly unlawful general plan of improvement. In the alternative, the landowners sought mandamus to force an election on the method of financing. The lower court initially granted mandamus relief that required the district to conduct an election on the proposed method of financing. After the voters overwhelmingly approved the district's method of financing, the lower court entered summary judgment against the landowners' request for an injunction. However, the lower court sustained the landowners' motion for attorney fees. Both the landowners and the district appealed. The court affirmed because the proposed method of financing was lawful under the Watershed District Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1201 et seq., and Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5, and because Kan. Stat.

The city, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-618, created sewer districts and assessed the cost of the construction to the property owners. The property owners alleged that the special assessments against their individual tracts were excessive; that the actions of the city, in determining the boundaries of the districts and apportioning the cost of the system, were arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, oppressive, unlawful, confiscatory and void, and that the levy and collection of said special assessments should be enjoined. The trial court found in favor of the property owners. In reversing, the court held that the method used in allocating the cost of the sewer system was fair and reasonable and that the appraisers acted only in an advisory capacity. Further, the costs were apportioned upon a plan expressly approved by the court, that was, in proportion to the value of the lots taxed without improvements thereon.

The court concluded the doctor's license was properly revoked for unprofessional conduct under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2837. The court concluded that the Board's order was substantially supported by evidence based upon hospital records and files in surgical cases handled by the doctor and testimony by other doctors. Therefore, the court set aside and reversed the district court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district court had reduced the assessed valuation of all property except that belonging to the taxpayers. The taxpayers contended that the district court lacked authority to set the valuation of property and that such authority was given solely to the county officials. On review, the court agreed and granted the taxpayers' motion for a writ of mandamus. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the duty of assessment was given to the administrative branch of government and that the courts could not interfere in the absence of fraud or arbitrary action. Thus, the court held that the district court's order was void. The court then held that it had the authority to grant mandamus relief on the issue. In so holding the court found that the taxpayers showed an injury specific to themselves rather than a community-wide injury, and thus, the taxpayers had the right to seek mandamus relief.</SPAN></P>

The incident left the injured party disabled. The injured party filed an action in which he alleged that the city's employees' neglect was the proximate cause of his damages. The city filed a motion to dismiss in which it alleged that the injured party did not comply with the provisions of Kan. Stat.

On review, the injured party's major assertion was that &sect; 12-105 should not bar his action where he was mentally and physically incapacitated. The court determined that the fulfillment of the requirements of &sect; 12-105 was a condition precedent to the maintenance of a damage action against a city and that &sect; 12-105 made no exceptions for an injured person who was incompetent.</SPAN></P>

Execution of the warrant yielded crowbars, flashlights, gloves, walkie talkie radios, assorted pliers and screwdrivers, a gas can and spout, a canvas bag, rifle and shotgun shells, a high speed hacksaw blade, and other tools. Subsequently, defendant was convicted of possessing burglary tools. On appeal, defendant contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2437 was unconstitutional.

He was seen on four or five times by officers who questioned him about the burglary and larceny. He finally gave a taped confession, which was admitted into evidence at his trial. He was convicted of second degree burglary and larceny. On appeal, the court held that in determining the voluntariness of a confession, the range of inquiry in a case where there had been a prolonged interrogation of an accused ignorant of his rights had to be broad and the judgment in each instance had to be based on the totality of the circumstances. The court also held that the trial court denied defendant an adequate proceeding separate and apart from the jury to determine whether his confession was freely and voluntarily made where the trial court's range of inquiry was limited and where the inquiry was based on considerations far less than the totality of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 21-732 applied to escape from confinement during the act of transport in a means of conveyance and that the words &quot;going to&quot; were vague and open to interpretation, thereby rendering the statute unconstitutional. In affirming, the court ruled that &sect; 21-732 applied to escape from confinement for a felony to a term less than life and that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-735 and 21-735a referred to escape from confinement in the county jail for a lesser offense. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-732 was applicable when defendant had reached his destination of confinement in the state penitentiary, as well as while he was confined awaiting physical transport to the penitentiary, because the sentence began to run when he was delivered to the sheriff's custody for execution of the sentence in accordance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-1518. The court rejected the argument that Kan. Stat.

Intervenor teachers joined with defendants in their cross-appeal from the judgment ordering non-tenured teachers to be integrated. The court held that the Act only barred discrimination and was not concerned with the integration of the races on the teaching staff of a public school system or anywhere else. Thus, defendants could not have been compelled under the Act to transfer a teacher in the public school system over his or her objection, because of his or her race, to a school other than the one to which he or she had been regularly assigned in order to better integrate the faculty. No teachers testified that they had been discriminated against in any way. Furthermore, there was no racial discrimination, as both white and African-American teachers were affected. Thus, probationary teachers were not subject to being transferred over objection to attain integration in defendants' school system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and larceny. Defendant first challenged the conviction contending that his right to a speedy trial was violated. The court disagreed noting that defendant, who was confined in October, was brought to trial at the first term after his preliminary hearing, and the indictment was duly filed. Accordingly, there was no undue delay, and his right to a speedy trial, as guaranteed by Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-1304, and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-1431, was not violated. Defendant then argued that the trial court erred in admitting oral statements made by defendant, which were reduced to writing. The court noted that a written statement in the nature of an admission was admissible in evidence to the extent that it related to the offense charged and provided it did not contravene the Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 10 privilege against self-incrimination. The written statement was properly introduced. Finally, defendant challenged the admission of evidence of his possession of a stolen check. Such unexplained possession, however, was prima facie evidence of guilt sufficient to warrant conviction. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a motor vehicle accident in a vehicle. The Motor Vehicle Department notified defendant that pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-726, if he did not post security as required by the Motor Vehicle Safety and Responsibility Act of Kansas, his driver's license, vehicle tags, and registration would be suspended. Defendant failed to post security, and the Motor Vehicle Department ordered defendant to return his license and registration. Defendant argued that the fine imposed by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-760 was the exclusive penalty for refusal to surrender the operator's license, registration and tags. However, the court determined that violation of &sect; 8-760 was a misdemeanor and the fine imposed by that section was really an administrative cost imposed upon one whose license was suspended. Since the suspension of a driver's license was not the taking of property, the court determined that the legislature had the power to require, as a condition to the right to operate a motor vehicle, the procurement of insurance or the furnishing of proof of financial responsibility. The court further concluded that the financial responsibility law did not violate the constitution.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-5715.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers conceded they were not maintaining a high school within the literal terms of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-5715. They contended, however, that the legislature sought only to tax rural territory that was not included within the boundaries of any high-school district. They argued that because their district was still organized and had a school board that had adopted a budget providing for the education of its students, it did not come within the purview of the statute. In reversing the judgment, the court found that the lawmakers were concerned about territory outside the boundaries of any high-school district not bearing a share of the high-school tax burden. They sought to remedy that by the levy provided for in &sect; 72-5715. The import of &sect; 72-5715 was to impose a tax on taxable tangible property not located within the boundaries of any organized high-school district which had adopted a budget and thus made provisions for the education of its own students. While the taxpayers' district did not conduct classes or operate a high-school facility, it remained organized as a district, and its board adopted a budget providing for the cost of educating its students for the school year.</SPAN></P>

The State alleged that the writ should be denied for the reason that the allegations were without merit and that the appeal should be dismissed as not being timely perfected or in the alternative for lack of merit. The court denied the writ and affirmed the conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in allowing petitioner's guilty plea because he understood the proceedings, comprehended his position, and made his defense. The court held petitioner's mental aberrations did not preclude the acceptance of an otherwise proper guilty plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of illegal possession and sale of marijuana. He appealed, arguing that the juvenile code amendment increasing the age of juveniles to 18 was ambiguous or uncertain as to the legislative intent, and by giving a strict construction to the habitual criminal act, the juvenile code, as amended, was to be given retroactive effect, thereby transforming defendant's prior felony convictions to mere acts of delinquency because he was under 18 when the acts were committed. The court found that the force and effect of defendant's prior felony convictions was not altered by the amendment to the juvenile code. Defendant also argued that he was improperly sentenced to a term of 18 years under the habitual criminal act. The court found nothing in the record that supported a charge of discrimination by reason of willful, arbitrary, designed, deliberate, intentional, or concerted action by prosecuting officials. The court noted that no objection was made by defendant to disclosures concerning his previous criminal history and held that the trial court did not impose a sentence that was so disproportionate to the offense as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to the purpose for which the evidence was admitted. The court determined that the jury instructions were improper because the trial court failed to instruct the jury concerning the purposes for which the similar offenses could be considered as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455. In addition, the court found that the state's cross-examination of defendant violated Kan. Stat.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the city's denial of the landowners' apartment zoning application was reasonable. The landowners, by their own admission, refused to participate in a further study by the planning commission for the apartment zoning, after the city council voted to refer the matter back to the planning commission for such study.

The court affirmed the judgment and sentence, concluding that the irregularities alleged to have occurred in defendant's preliminary examination did not nullify either of defendant's convictions or sentences. The court reasoned that there was no evidence that defendant was prejudiced by the judge's relationship to the sheriff or his participation in the posse. The court noted that a preliminary examination was not a trial, that the examining magistrate had no power to acquit but only the power to discharge an accused from custody, and that such a discharge was not a bar to another examination.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-4801 (Supp. 1965). Defendant appealed the conviction on the ground that his 15-year-old daughter's Amish School attendance and her correspondence school participation complied with the statute, and that it violated his constitutional right to freedom of religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's daughter attended an Amish school one day per week, and she was enrolled as a high school student in a correspondence school. Defendant argued that her enrollment in the schools satisfied the requirements of &sect; 72-4801, and he also argued that &sect; 72-4901 was unconstitutional as applied because it violated his constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion. The conviction was affirmed. The court held that: (1) defendant violated &sect; 72-4801 because his daughter did not continuously attend any school acceptable under the compulsory attendance statute, and (2) &sect; 72-4801 did not infringe upon defendant's constitutionally guaranteed religious freedom. The court noted that religious liberty included the absolute right to believe but only a limited right to act, and that the failure to comply with reasonable requirements in the exercise of the police power for the general welfare was not condoned in the name of religious freedom. The court found that &sect; 72-4801 did not infringe upon the right to worship or to believe insofar as defendant or his daughter was concerned. Their freedoms to worship and to believe remained absolute and were not affected by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the Board had attempted to cure constitutional defects in the Act by the promulgation and filing of rules and regulations. The court pointed out that the lawmaking power of the state was vested in the legislature and that the Board could not breathe constitutional life into a statute by rules and regulations.The court concluded that as applied to the case, the rules and regulations adopted by the Board were unauthorized because they were in direct contravention of the express terms of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general of Kansas filed an information in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) alleging that certain books being sold at intervenors' bookstore were obscene in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1102. The trial court rejected the intervenors' challenges to the procedure used but held that the books were not obscene and denied the requested seizure warrant. The State appealed and the intervenors cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the books were not obscene within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1102 and in refusing to issue a seizure warrant pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1102c. The intervenors argued that the books were protected by U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 11. The court concluded that the books were obscene. The books related, to the exclusion of anything else, the illicit sexual capers of the principal figures, running the gamut in drawn-out episodic form, chapter by chapter, of feats of sexual prowess and perversion in one form or another. None of the books made any effort at characterization or insight into human nature, no attempt was made to portray reality, no ideas were presented, and no story was told. Additionally, their packaging was a blatant appeal to the prurient. The court found that the books were therefore subject to seizure under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1102c. The standards of obscenity contained in the Kansas statutes were within permissible constitutional limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's orders overruling the intervenors' pretrial motions.

Sess. Laws ch. 278, which amended certain sections of the Kansas Juvenile Code, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-801 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition alleging that the juvenile court of Sedgwick County had exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings concerning a child living or found within the county. The State contended that the judge had a duty under the Kansas Juvenile Act to assume jurisdiction in such proceedings, but had refused and continued to refuse to assume jurisdiction in all proceedings concerning such a child. The trial court granted an order of mandamus commanding the judge to assume jurisdiction. The underlying question on appeal was whether 1965 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 278 was in whole or in part unconstitutional. The court held a juvenile offender committed to the boys industrial school could not have been transferred to the Kansas state industrial reformatory without a trial in the criminal sense, wherein the offender was charged with a felony and tried as an adult with all of the accompanying constitutional safeguards. Therefore, the provision of 1965 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 6(a)(5), which authorized the juvenile court to commit the 16-year-old child to the state industrial reformatory, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners contended that the Community Junior College Act, which authorized a county-wide ad valorem levy for community junior college tuition, violated Kan.

Ann. &sect; 72-6901 (Supp.1965) et seq. did not create junior colleges as part of the common-school system but created a public system of community junior colleges with separate faculties and facilities of their own, and part of the operating expense was to be paid by the students in tuition and the balance by taxation. The provisions of Kan. Const. art. 6, &sect; 2 relating to common schools, therefore, had no application to the Act. The court also disagreed that the out-district tuition provided for in the Act constitutes taxation without representation. The county had a representative when the law was enacted. This was all the representation that is necessary. Finally, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-6916(b) (Supp. 1965) did not violate Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1 because the taxing district was in each instance the county involved or the community junior college district involved, and within such taxing district any tax levied would be uniform and equal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant enforcement officials appealed from a judgment of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) in plaintiff liquor suppliers' action for a declaratory judgment that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-112 to 41-1122 were unconstitutional, and to enjoin enforcement of the act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppliers claimed that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-112 to 41-1122, which regulated liquor prices established by out-of-state suppliers, allowed for minimum sales prices established by state officials, and made violation of the act a misdemeanor, unlawfully regulated interstate commerce and violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court reversed a trial court holding that the challenged provisions were void. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. 21 gave the state the right to regulate the distribution and sale of liquor, and that the act was not void for vagueness, as it provided a reasonably definite mandate that anyone reading it could understand. Stating that the statute was not simply a price-fixing device for the benefit of Kansas distributors, and that the maintenance of price stability was in the interest of temperance and the prevention of chaos in the liquor traffic, the court sustained the act as a police regulation controlling the liquor industry. The fact that suppliers had difficulty complying with the act and suffered economic hardship had no bearing on its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver appealed the trial court's judgment, arguing that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-259(a), as it pertained to a hearing in a trial court on an appeal from an order of the Commission revoking a driver's license for refusal to submit to blood alcohol test was unconstitutional. The court held that there was a standard or guideline plainly present in &sect; 8-259(a), reasonableness of the failure to submit to the chemical test. While the discretion of a court was not to be substituted for the discretion of an administrative agency, the discretion of the Commission was circumscribed by the statutory criterion that the failure to submit to the chemical test had to be unreasonable before suspension or revocation was to be applied. Thus, &sect; 8-259(a) necessarily called for a weighing of the evidence and a determination was based on a preponderance of the evidence. The review provided in &sect; 8-259(a) was sufficiently judicial in character. Section 8-259(a) required a trial de novo, with the burden of proof on the Commission, as the one seeking affirmative relief.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a pro-se motion challenging the application of the habitual criminal act, and the trial court found that no substantial questions of law or triable issues of fact were presented. Defendant's contention was that by the use of the terms &quot;every person&quot; and &quot;shall be&quot; the legislature contemplated the statute was to be utilized as a matter of course in every case when sentencing an habitual offender, whereas, in actual practice the act was used only at the discretion of the county attorney. The court held that the exercise of reasonable judicial discretion which resulted in a discrimination in the application of a law to those of the same class did not necessarily or generally render the law unconstitutional as depriving one of the equal protection of the law. Numerous statements about what might or might not have happened to other felons with prior convictions were insufficient to render the statute, as administered, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A year earlier, the court had held that the statute apportioning the seats of the state House of Representatives violated the 14th amendment to the federal constitution because it did not apportion on a population basis. After the legislature availed itself of an opportunity to adopt a constitutionally compliant act by enacting House Bill 504, the matter again came before the court for a determination whether the Bill complied with constitutional requirements. The court held that it did. The districts created by the Bill were compact and contained a population and area as similar as may be in their economical, political and cultural interests. While mathematical exactness was not a constitutional requirement, the mathematical exactness of Bill No. 504 was impressive. Viewed in its entirety, the apportionment plan revealed a rational and conscientious state policy of providing representation for the people by observing county boundary lines in creating representative districts, which was abandoned only to the extent as was required by the overriding limitations of both the state and federal Constitutions of maintaining the basic standard of equality of representation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that his constitutional rights were abridged because he was not arraigned until 13 days after his arrest. The court affirmed the judgment, finding no authority holding that undue delay in taking a prisoner before a magistrate was of itself a denial of due process. The court found that it was only where unwarranted delay prejudiced an accused upon his trial that it might be said to violate due process. The inmate also claimed that failure to appoint a lawyer to represent him at his preliminary hearing denied him his constitutional right to counsel. The court determined that the inmate's claim was without merit, finding that there was not the slightest indication of prejudice to the inmate's rights that resulted from the lack of counsel at the preliminary hearing. Finally, the inmate asserted that while he was in jail he was not permitted to consult an attorney before appearing in county court. The court determined that the inmate failed to establish that he was refused permission to consult counsel because not one of the witnesses called to testify on his behalf corroborated his allegation that he was refused permission to call a lawyer.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the landowners were afforded complete ingress and egress from their abutting property to a frontage road and reasonable access from their property via the frontage road to the through-traffic lanes of the controlled access facility. Thus, the court concluded that the landowners' rights of access had not been taken or appropriated by the Commission, but merely subjected to regulation under the police power of the State, and that their damages, if any, were non-compensable.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-501 et seq., by offering retail consumers of dairy products a free gift for redeeming side panels of milk cartons. The Finney District Court (Kansas) granted injunctive relief, and appellants sought review, contending that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-503(a) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-503(a) a wholesaler or distributor in the dairy industry was prohibited from giving to a retail dealer or consumer money, equipment, or other things of value, regardless of the intent or purpose of the transaction. On review, the court held that appellants failed to sustain the burden of showing that &sect; 50-503(a) was unconstitutional. The absence of a required criminal intent in doing the actions proscribed by &sect; 50-503(a) was not fatal under the Due Process Clause because the proscribed actions had a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose expressed in the Act, which was to prohibit unfair trade practices in dealings in dairy products. The phrase &quot;other things having a real or substantial value&quot; as used in &sect; 50-503(a) was sufficiently definite to apprise appellants of the actions prohibited. Clearly, the gift was given because it had real or substantial value which milk consumers readily understood. Because the Act contained a separability provision in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-510, &sect; 50-503(a) was separable from &sect; 50-503(l)-(m), which involved a prohibition against sales below cost and had been found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed from that court for trial de novo in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) where, his counsel having waived a jury trial, the matter proceeded to trial upon his plea of not guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged in effect that defendant maintained a pen where animals were kept closer than 25 feet to the dwelling house of a neighbor, and permitted it to remain unclean to the annoyance of other state citizens. At trial, the state conceded that the pen was not within 25 feet of a house. The State elected to rely upon the second portion of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1212. On appeal, defendant claimed that &sect; 21-1212 was not sufficiently flexible to permit such an election. As the court read &sect; 21-1212, it had reference to a pen within 25 feet of a dwelling house of another, or to a pen that the owner permitted to remain unclean to the annoyance of any state citizens, regardless of its proximity to a dwelling house. Also, the meaning of the word &quot;unclean,&quot; as used in &sect; 21-1212, was not vague. A person could determine that he was violating &sect; 21-1212 when he permitted his pen to accumulate an excessive amount of manure and other refuse to the annoyance of any state citizens. He was not violating &sect; 21-1212 if he kept his pen in such a clean condition it did not accumulate a sufficient amount of manure and other offensive refuse to constitute an annoyance to other citizens.</SPAN></P>

The associations had no legal entity separate and apart from the members of which they were composed. Under Kansas practice, a lawsuit could only be maintained by individuals or by corporations. Because the judgment was a nullity due to timely objection to the associations' lack of capacity to maintain the action, there was nothing before the court for consideration on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill collector purchased from the receiver of a defunct credit union a promissory note. The note was reduced to judgment, and the bill collector threatened garnishment against the debtor's wages. The debtor directed the bill collector to &sect; 60-2310(d) and informed him that he would issue a suit for wrongful garnishment. The debtor argued that the petition did not state a proper case for declaratory judgment because it failed to present a justiciable issue. The bill collector argued that &sect; 60-2310(d) was unconstitutional because it was discriminatory. The court upheld the judgment against the bill collector. Under the facts alleged in the petition, there was a justiciable issue as to the constitutionality of the statute. Section &sect; 60-2310(d), standing alone, precluded the right of garnishment generally to assignees of accounts and collection agencies. However, &sect; 60-2310 was designated as an exemption of personal earnings of heads of family. The word &quot;garnishment&quot; was substituted by the legislature in &sect; 60-2310(d) with the intention that it would apply only to exemption of personal earnings of heads of family. Garnishment was available to all creditors if they observed its terms.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that pursuant to Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought compliance with statutes by an individual and his companies in selling pre-need burial lots. Under a contract providing 20 percent of the price would go into a trust fund for permanent maintenance, the court held a statute requiring 10 percent deposits into a trust as payments were received controlled. Statutes regulating pre-need sales were constitutional as reasonable regulations under the police power to avoid fraud during the long period between payment for the burial site and contract performance by the seller. The court affirmed rejection of the state's contention that defendants were engaged in the business of insurance. The waiver of payments still due if the purchaser died was incidental to the overall business of selling cemetery lots, and there was no premium being charged based on the age of the purchaser.</SPAN></P>

After being sentenced to confinement, defendant filed a motion to vacate the sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507. The district court denied the motion and the court affirmed. Specifically, the court rejected defendant's contention that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-1304 was unconstitutional because nothing in the statute authorized the denial of the right of an accused to consult counsel under the Escobedo rule. Furthermore, the court found that defendant was denied his right to appeal only because of his acquiescence in the sentence and judgment of the district court by making an application for probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed the Act was unconstitutional because it distinguished between two types of clubs. Class A clubs were not operated for profit, and were permitted to operate liquor pools whereby patrons could purchase liquor through the club at the club's cost from the liquor retailer. The liquor pools were not considered sales of liquor. Further, Class A club members could extend their privileges to guests. Class B clubs, however, required extensive membership procedures and dues. Class B club members could not extend their privileges to guests. Plaintiffs were owners and members of Class B clubs and claimed that the distinction between profit and nonprofit clubs was arbitrary and unreasonable. In affirming the trial court's determination that the Act was constitutional, the court found that the legislature was empowered, pursuant to the state's police power, to prohibit the consumption of alcoholic liquor in licensed Class A and Class B clubs. It had the power to permit the consumption of alcoholic liquor in both types of clubs upon such conditions as it saw fit to impose, or to permit its consumption in one type of club and entirely prohibit its consumption in the other.</SPAN></P>

The Shawnee County District Court, Division No. 1, Kansas, entered judgment for the taxpayer. The Director appealed, arguing that the direct allocation method of Kan. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a foreign corporation whose gross income was derived, in part, from property located and business transacted in Kansas.

Laws 485, &sect; 24, in determining the income allocable to Kansas for income taxation purposes. The court held that the Director acted within the scope and intent of Kan. Gen.

Direct allocation of income was practicable on the books and accounts of the taxpayer, together with the applicable deductions, and the direct method clearly reflected the net of the taxpayer attributable to Kansas. The taxpayer's business was not of such a unitary character in its multi-state operations as to require the application of the formula method of income allocation. The direct allocation method was the favored one, and the nature of the taxpayer's business did not render direct allocation impracticable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 19-1569 (1961) did not authorize the county officials to buy more ground than they could possibly use for a county jail, and with the avowed intention of acquiring a site and equipping a jail for use by a particular city. There was nothing in the resolution or the record to indicate that the county officials intended to acquire a site and equip a jail for use by the city. There was also nothing in the record to indicate any abuse of discretion in the determination of the amount of land necessary. The taxpayer contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-1590 only authorized the county officials to acquire land for necessary attached additions to existing buildings. Such a construction of &sect; 19-1590 was too narrow. The phrase &quot;for the purpose of acquiring for the erection of necessary additions to the existing courthouse and buildings&quot; was not to be interpreted to mean that additions had to be attached to existing buildings. New buildings erected on a courthouse site but not attached to the main courthouse or jail were additions thereto. No error was found, which would justify the granting of a new trial or a reversal of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

In Kansas, the seats in the House of Representatives were apportioned on the basis of population and geography. An action in quo warranto was initiated for the court to determine that the apportionment method was unconstitutional and void in light of the Supreme Court's decision. The court determined that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution required that it find that the apportionment methodology for the House of Representatives violated the law. It held as inoperative portions of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2, and art. 10, &sect; 1, as well as the existing apportionment of the House of Representatives contained in House Bill No. 2 of the 1964 Special Session of the legislature.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2801.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant issued stamps to merchants that were redeemable solely by United States Series E Savings Bonds (bonds). Merchants would agree to offer defendant's stamps to customers when cash purchases were made. Prior to the issuance of stamps to the merchants defendant deposited funds with a bank in sufficient sums to purchase the amount of the bonds that would be required for redemption. Defendant's trading stamps were redeemed by the holders thereof by sending the required number of completed stamp books and an executed application for a bond to the bank. The state attorney general first issued an opinion claiming the practice did not violate the trading stamp act, but then reversed course and filed suit against defendant. The court, construing the penal nature of the trading stamp act strictly, held that defendant's practices did not violate the trading stamp act. Bonds were not included in any of the words &quot;goods, wares, merchandise or cash&quot; as such words were used in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2801. Bonds were more commonly used as evidence of the purchase price to be paid for &quot;goods, wares or merchandise,&quot; or a means of raising cash to pay the purchase price.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that it was not unreasonable to put the power to revoke and suspend the licenses of chiropractors in a state board consisting of five doctors of medicine, three doctors of osteopathy, and three chiropractors. Further, when dealing with the broad field of the treatment of human ills and the protection of the health and welfare of the public, the legislature could delegate much discretion to the boards created by the acts. Finally, the standards established by the acts pertaining to educational background, moral character, regular postgraduate work, and the approval of chiropractic schools contained adequate standards and guideposts and could not be said to constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative powers.</SPAN></P>

The parties stipulated and agreed that a trial by jury should be waived upon trial of the charges and that the matter should be submitted to the trial court. It was also agreed that the evidence and all of the witnesses in the trial of the first two men should be considered as if the witnesses were personally present and presented in defendant's action. Based on the record defendant was convicted as charged. Defendant's motion for a new trial was overruled.

Bill of Rights, &sect; 18 provided that all persons, for injuries suffered in person, reputation, or property, should have a remedy by due course of law, and justice administered without delay. While the statute at issue did not confer immunity for torts upon charitable or nonprofit organizations, it was an attempt to circumvent by indirection the constitutional guarantee.

The governor signed the second bill, but attached to the bill the statement that the subject precinct was intended to be included in only one district. The court examined the question of whether or not it could construe the second bill to determine in which representative district the legislature intended to place the precinct. The court resolved the apparent conflict appearing on the face of the bill through the use of the law of statutory construction. The court found that the intention of the legislature to place the precinct in one particular district was supported by a review of the population statistics used by the legislature in defining proposed districts prior to drafting the bill. The court designated the precinct as part of one representative district.</SPAN></P>

After noting that during the legislative process the purpose of the Law changed from promoting the health, recreation, and welfare of the people to eliminate competition on Sunday of grocery store owners having more than one place of business, employing more than three people, or occupying more than 5,000 square feet, the court held that the Law violated Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, because it did not advance the general welfare of the public and did not operate uniformly throughout the state, but discriminated unfairly against a class of retailers. The two provisions of the Law that were unconstitutional were not severable because they were an integral and indispensable part of the whole scheme and purpose of the Law, and the entire Law, therefore, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 65-665 (Supp. 1961) on the ground that the product was mislabeled. The company brought an action against the state officials seeking to enjoin enforcement of the embargo contending that the product did not require special labels because it was not a milk or cream imitation. The trial court rendered judgment for the company. The state officials appealed the decision contending that it was erroneous. The court noted that the purpose of &sect; 65-665 was to prevent deception and confusion on the part of the consumer. The labels contained on the coffee additive clearly established it as a product distinct from cream or milk. Therefore, the question was must a product which contained no milk products and which was a distinctive new product having uses similar to milk products be labeled an imitation milk product? The court thought not. The coffee additive was not an imitation milk product within the recognized principles of law for determining what was an imitation either in fact or in law, thus the labeling requirements of &sect; 65-665 did not apply to it. The judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The questions presented were whether Senate Bill 440 was 1) a correct apportionment based on the census; or 2) it was void because the governor did not sign the same bill passed by the legislature? The court found that the legislature failed to report the bill correctly because when engrossed and enrolled and signed by the governor, a portion of the original bill was omitted. The court determined that the bill was a void enactment based on the violation of the mandatory requirements of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 14. Moreover, the method of equal proportioning was generally regarded as producing the smallest relative difference in population per representative, and the smallest relative differences in the individual share in a representative. The court held that apportionment by such a formula to the Kansas population would have resulted in an allocation of seats to the counties based upon population. The court retained jurisdiction and withheld further determination of the appeal. This afforded the governor an opportunity to call the legislature into special session to consider an adoption of apportionment acts based upon the state census in accordance with the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner's voluntary plea of guilty was a confession of guilt of the crime charged and of every fact alleged in the charge. The guilty plea had the effect of waiving any and all irregularities prior to the entry of such plea. The court rejected the prisoner's claim that he did not commit the offense of burglary in the nighttime as charged in the information. The prisoner's guilt or innocence was not at issue in a habeas corpus proceeding. The prisoner's uncorroborated alleged ineffective assistance of counsel was insufficient to overcome the presumption that counsel was effect.</SPAN></P>

In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the inmate contended that his sentence was not authorized by law and was imposed in violation of Kan. Gen.

On review, the court affirmed because it found that, as stated expressly in &sect; 62-1521, the statute was inapplicable to the crimes of murder and treason. While the court agreed that the statutes under which the inmate was sentenced should have been stated in the journal entry, pursuant to Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-1516 (1949), it noted that the failure of the sentencing court to comply with this requirement did not void the sentence.

The owners stated in their amended petition that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it refused to license a pinball machine to an operator who had purchased a Federal tax stamp. The Federal Tax Stamp was required under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect;4461 for those owning a coin-operated amusement or gaming device. The owners contended that there was no way they could have complied with the laws in existence if the ordinance was allowed to stand, because if they complied with ordinance they could not have complied with the Federal rules and regulations, and vice versa. Holding that the Federal Government had established no law with regard to the legality of gambling on pinball machines, each state was free to determine whether it wished to permit it or not. The court held that the ordinance was not unreasonable or arbitrary under the City's police powers because of the potentialities for injury and harm to health and welfare.

The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that the exception under Kan. Gen.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 21-2801 to 21-2805 (1961 Supp.). The exception was justified by the difficulty of Kansas regulating the many articles, especially small items such as packages of cigarettes, that were manufactured out of state.

The search of defendant and the automobile under his control was incident to a lawful arrest and the seizure of the stolen checks found in the course of the search was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner, who lived near one of the water wells, claimed that he had a vested property right in the underground waters lying under his land and that the city's pumping of the wells, pursuant to an appropriation permit that was granted under the authority of the Act, diverted the subterranean water from under the landowner's property resulting in irreparable injury to the landowner. The court held that (1) the disputed ground waters were percolating and hence migratory and fugitive; (2) the Act was a valid exercise of the state's police power and did not violate the federal or state constitution because the state had the power to depart from the common-law doctrine of riparian rights and to establish the doctrine of appropriation and application to beneficial use; and (3) pursuant to the Act, the ownership of land did not carry with it any ownership of vested rights to underlying ground water not actually diverted and applied to beneficial use. Thus, the court held that the landowner failed to allege or prove any water-use rights under the Act because the landowner had not initiated any actual use of the water for any beneficial purpose.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. 72-6701 et seq. (Supp. 1961). The Graham District Court (Kansas) heard the case as soon as the pleadings were filed and found the Act violated the state constitution in a number of particulars including the charge that it unlawfully delegated legislative authority. Defendant state officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the urgency and importance of the issues involved, the court handed down an opinion that affirmed the judgment of the district court, and then exercised its reserved right to write a more adequate opinion later. In that opinion, the court stated that the Act unlawfully delegated legislative power to the county boards of school planning in violation of Kan. Const. art 2, &sect; 1. The court believed that, despite the fact some standards were contained in Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-6702 of the Act, adequate standards were not provided for such county planning committees. While that shortcoming was sufficient to render the entire Act unconstitutional, other infirmities were found. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-6729 seemed to contain matter not covered in the title of the Act because it appeared that the unified school districts referred to in &sect; 72-6729 were districts that were not organized &quot;by a vote of the people&quot; as the title provided. Thus, it appeared Kan. Const. arts. 2, 16 were violated. Also, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 72-6721 seemed to be indefinite on the questions such as whether the new unified districts should become responsible for the bonded indebtedness of the absorbed districts.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 21-955 and 21-956 (1949) and held that because the statutes prescribed punishment for anyone who sold or exposed to sale goods, wares or merchandise which were not articles of immediate necessity, but did not define by any objective standard what constituted a sale of property of that character, any attempt to enforce the statutes would be the equivalent of an effort to carry out a statute which in terms merely penalized and punished all acts detrimental to the public interest when unjust and unreasonable in the estimation of the court and jury. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in declaring the statute inoperative and void and discharging defendant because the statute was so vague, indefinite and uncertain that it failed to inform men of common intelligence what conduct on their part would render them liable to its penalties and provided no reasonable definite standard of guilt which apprised them of the nature and cause of the accusation against them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a brief opinion intended to expedite an early resolution of the matter, the court opined that the Act unlawfully delegated legislative power to the county boards of school planning in violation of Kan.

In short, the county planning committees are not given adequate standards to enable them to act as administrative bodies. The court also noted that the content of the act appeared to include matter that was not covered in the title, which violated Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16. Finally, 1961 Kan. Sess.

Appellant received a license, not a property right, when the original certificate was issued.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By 1961 Kan. Sess. Laws 81, the City passed ordinances to issuance revenue bonds to buy a site and build and equip facilities on it, with that property to be leased to a private corporation for the running of a textile business. Kan. Const. art. XII, &sect; 15 stated in part that the power of cities to tax, assess, borrow, contract debts, and loan their credit was to be restricted to prevent abuse of that power. The court rejected the argument that the enabling law, 1961 Kan. Sess. Laws 81, violated art. XII, &sect; 15. The court found that there were restrictions to prevent cities from abusing their power to loan their credit if it could be said that their credit was loaned by taking advantage of the provisions of ch. 81. The court wrote that per precedents where the subject law had restrictions the law had to be upheld as valid and that where the legislature deemed a restriction to be sufficient it was final. Per ch. 81, one restriction was that the bonds could not be general obligations of cities and could not be payable by taxation. Another restriction was that any city could proceed only where its governing body found that the welfare of that city would be promoted.</SPAN></P>

The Board filed a demurrer, alleging that the landowners did not have the legal capacity to maintain action under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 60-3127 et seq. (1949) because their petition failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 60-1211 (1949), 25-1501 (1949). At issue was the validity of a ballot issue presented to the electors of the county. The landowners alleged that it was contradictory and confusing, and that the existing courthouse site had never been abandoned. On appeal, the court held that because the landowners had alleged that the Board had sought to appropriate funds piecemeal, thereby avoiding the statutory limitation on expenditures and their taxes would increase as a result, they had capacity to bring suit in their behalf and for those similarly situated. Because the landowners' pocketbooks were effected, they had a right to maintain an action under &sect; 60-1211 (1949).</SPAN></P>

Disagreeing, the court found that the 1,060 &quot;yes&quot; votes cast by the legal electors to relocate the county seat to Elkhart was in excess of a simple majority of the legal electors, which was required under Kan.

Defendants appealed an order striking portions of their answers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's declaratory judgment petition alleged that he and defendants owned lands abutting the creek, he used the normal flow of the creek for domestic purposes, and defendants, by withdrawing large quantities of water, stopped the flow or rendered it unusable. Defendants alleged that they lawfully withdrew water for irrigation under state certificates and the water appropriation act, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 82a-701 et seq., as amended. The court held that the trial court properly overruled defendants' demurrer because the petition and answers alleged an actual controversy with respect to the rights to the use and flow of water. The court held that the trial court erred in sustaining plaintiff's motions to strike the answers, which set forth additional facts showing an actual controversy as to matters covered by the water appropriation act. The court treated the motions to strike as demurrers and not replies and held that the parties sought to enlarge the scope of the declaratory judgment act, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 60-3127 et seq., by attempting, in advance of joining issues, to have matters prejudged which may have become material in determining the propriety of the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-1108 mandated that manufacturers and their agents file suggested prices for distributors to retailers and by retailers to the public. Kan. Gen.

The district court determined that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that whether there should be minimum prices and whether such prices were to be imposed under the police power of the State was for the legislature to determine . The delegation of the ultimate use of the police power was sufficient to render a statute unconstitutional. Nowhere in the statute did the legislature find that the public welfare would be enhanced if the police power was used to establish minimum prices for intoxicating liquor sold in Kansas. The legislature had unconstitutionally delegated to the director and to the Board of Review the authority and discretion to make such a decision.</SPAN></P>

The probate judge did not permit the attorney to appear in the county probate court absent the association or appearance of local counsel as required by Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 41 and Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 54. The court affirmed the judgment. The court had the authority to promulgate the rules because under Kan. Const. art.

It was irrelevant that the rules did not exist when the attorney was licensed in Kansas because the court had a legitimate interest in keeping the standards of law practice at a high level and this interest continued after licensing. The court could exercise state police power, and the proper exercise of police power was due process.

The court rejected the guardian's contention that the statutes were unconstitutional, but noted that &sect; 59-2276 did not authorize the probate court to set aside or otherwise disturb an existing guardianship, and that discharge of a patient as sane did not establish that the patient was mentally competent to handle his affairs and entitled to have the guardianship vacated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the law was unconstitutional and the court affirmed. It found that the law placed arbitrary and unreasonable limitations on the conduct of a lawful business and was designed to prohibit the sale of new merchandise at public auctions by itinerant vendors. Further, the law was discriminatory and denied the auctioneer equal protection, as its bonding requirement was conditioned not only on the payment of damages sustained from dishonest or fraudulent conduct, but also required the auctioneer to guarantee the performance of the manufacturer, a requirement not imposed on other retailers. Finally, the law denied the auctioneer the guarantees of due process as it attempted to make it immaterial whether the auctioneer had actual notice of a suit filed against him by providing that the auctioneer had to appoint the county clerk as his agent, that notice of the suit was to be made to the auctioneer by regular mail only, and that failure to mail a copy of the suit to the auctioneer did not affect a court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-1011c (1949). The court reversed the judgment. The court observed that there was no requirement of the Constitution that for every payment there had to be an equal benefit. The court held that the landowners were not denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, noting that the landowners had adequate notice pursuant to which they brought the action. The court pointed out that acts of the legislature were presumed to be constitutional and valid and that no challenge should be entertained on appeal to the court unless the particular constitutional provision alleged to be violated, or the particular controlling record to prove the invalidity, had been pleaded and presented to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's notice of appeal to the court recited only that he appealed from the judgment and sentence. He did not appeal from the order of the trial court overruling his motion for a new trial, nor had he specified the ruling as error. On review, the court upheld his conviction and sentence. The court ruled that because defendant did not appeal from the order overruling his motion for a new trial, despite his contention of trial errors, such errors were not reviewable. The court held that matters specified as error, in order to be reviewable, had to be within the purview of those matters contained in the notice of appeal, and, when defendant sought to have the court review alleged trial errors, he had to appeal from the order overruling his motion for a new trial, and he had to specify such ruling as error.

He contended that the Act was unconstitutional, and that at least two of the prior sentences for which petitioner served were void and therefore the Act could not have been applied to him. The court denied the writ and held that petitioner's first contention was absolutely without merit. The court ruled that it had many times before upheld the statute and similar statutes had been sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States and the courts of other jurisdictions. The court also held that petitioner had the burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the judgment against him. The court ruled that a petitioner in habeas corpus could not have challenged the sufficiency of the evidence shown as to the application of the Act. The unsupported testimony of a petitioner in a habeas corpus proceeding was insufficient to have sustained the burden of proof when confronted by judgments entitled to the presumption of regularity.

The complaint requested an injunction preventing the firm from selling the goods at less than cost as defined by &sect; 50-401. The firm filed a demurrer on the ground that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for the reason, among others, that Kan. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission's basic proration order for the subject gas field fixed 640 acres as the unit of land to be attributable to a gas well for full allowable operation, and the basic proration order provided that acreage might be attributable to the well if contiguous or adjoining. However, the commission granted the well owner's application to attribute non-contiguous and non-adjoining acreage without amending the basic proration order. The court found that the trial court did not err in holding that the commission's special order granting the well owner's application was in violation of the general basic proration order for the gas field and that it had to be set aside. The commission's special order granting exceptions to the basic proration order without amending the basic proration order to advise the public as to the ground rules for the utilization of the gas field was erroneous and contrary to the general rules of administrative law. Although the court did not agree with the trial court's conclusion that the special order was unconstitutional as special legislation, the court could affirm the judgment even though it did not agree with all of the reasons given for the decision.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 50-503(l), (m) (Supp. 1957), an unfair trade practice act dealing with the sale of dairy products. The trial court held that the act was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By passing Kan. Gen. Stat. ch. 50, art. 5 (Supp. 1957), the legislature attempted to make a number of actions unlawful when done by a distributor, processor, or wholesaler of dairy products. The State filed an action, seeking to enjoin the milk sellers from certain actions prohibited by Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-503(l), (m) (Supp. 1957). The trial court ruled in favor of the milk sellers, holding the entire act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment to the extent that it held that the provisions of &sect; 50-503(l), (m) were unconstitutional because they denied due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 18. The court modified the judgment to the extent that it held that the entire act was unconstitutional, holding that the remainder of the statute was not unconstitutional. The court pointed out (1) in determining the constitutionality of a statute, it was the court's duty to uphold legislation rather than defeat if there was any way possible to do so, and (2) the act contained a section specifying that the invalidity of a particular section would not render the entire act invalid.</SPAN></P>

The clubs then sought various motions in the trial court, including a motion seeking separate trials, a motion for an order allowing them to inspect all reports made concerning the case by certain persons, and a general demurrer attacking the sufficiency of the State's petition to state a cause of action. All were overruled by the trial court and the clubs sought review. On review, the court dismissed the appeal. The court found that the record before it showed that not one of the motions filed in the trial court by the clubs revealed the identity of those organizations or that they owned or had any interest in the slot machines which were the true defendants in the case. The court concluded that if the clubs were legal entities and a proper intervention was made by them, they would have been entitled to ask for the relief sought in the motions.

The inmate's sentences were to run concurrently. The inmate was sentenced under the Kansas Habitual Criminal Act, Kan. Gen.

The district court later made findings that the Act was unconstitutional. A pretrial order and journal entry of judgment was entered over objections of the Chief Engineer. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The district court erred by considering the constitutionality of a statute on its own motion. The invalidity of a statute had to be specifically raised by the pleadings. The notice of appeal from the Chief Engineer's order was a petition or any other pleading. Although the district court had discretionary power under Kan. Gen.

The bankruptcy proceeding was terminated by a consummation order and final decree. Under the provisions and requirements of the plan and order, the railroad executed two mortgages on its property. The county officials refused to accept the two mortgages for registration without the payment of the mortgage registration fees. The railroad paid the fees under protest and filed a suit to recover the fees. On appeal of a decision in favor of the railroad, the court reversed. The court noted that the mortgage registration fee was a tax. It held that the tax was not discriminatory. The court rejected the railroad's argument that the consummation order provided that the mortgages should be registered without paying the fee. The court also rejected the argument that payment of the tax would be a burden on interstate commerce. The fee was not unconstitutional under Kan.

Senate bill No. 425 directed the treasurer to transfer $ 100,000 from the unexpended balance in the natural gas conservation fund of the state corporation commission to the state general revenue fund. Senate bill No. 428 directed the treasurer to credit to the general fund 20 per cent of all costs collected by the commission. The trial court found the challenged statutes unconstitutional, and defendants appealed. The court affirmed because Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-609 (1949), Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-711 (1949), and Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-131 (1955) did not authorize the commission to collect expenses of regulation resulting from the assistance of other agencies.

However, the court found that a valid information was filed against the inmate under the uniform act and that he pleaded guilty thereto because the information specified no particular statute and its use of the word &quot;feloniously&quot; was surplusage; therefore, the court issued a writ to release the inmate from custody but directed the warden to turn the inmate over to the sheriff's custody.

Defendant filed a motion to quash the information against it, alleging that the Act violated both the federal and state constitutions. The trial court sustained the motion to quash. The State sought review. The state's highest court found that, as a whole, the Act was constitutional because it was a proper exercise of the state's police power to control the conduct of individuals in order to promote the public welfare. However, one portion of the Act, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-401(e) (1949) was impermissibly vague and therefore invalid.

On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant argued that the statute under which he was convicted, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-102(2) (1957 Supp.), was not applicable to him because the alcoholic liquor that he possessed had never passed through the state's system of controlling the traffic in alcoholic liquor and was never taxed in the hands of a manufacturer, licensed distributor, or licensed retailer; it was never subject to a Kansas tax. The court rejected defendant's argument and held that in construing all of the provisions of &sect; 41-102(2) together, it was clear that they were applicable to defendant. The court further held, despite defendant's argument to the contrary, that the state had the power under the Twenty-first Amendment, to regulate the manufacture, transportation, importation, sale, or possession of alcoholic liquors.

The court ordered the taxes paid to be held in a trust fund pending the outcome of the class action. The commission claimed that the interstate carriers did not have a right to be heard as a class action. The court ruled that the interstate carriers were not entitled to be heard as a class action concerning the commission's administration of the act because the alleged improper acts of the commission belonged to the individual wronged and was not common to the class. However, the court concluded that the interstate carriers were entitled to a refund of taxes that were paid under the act for the privilege of doing business in the state, because the tax was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause where it was used for the annual school fund, and not for highways or any form of police protection.</SPAN></P>

The subject matter of the act related generally to water management and soil conservation, a topic common to all the people of the state.

The optometrist initiated an action to enjoin the board from enforcing its order of revocation. The trial court denied the petition for an injunction and a motion for a new trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chemical company attempted to prevent the oil company from selling antifreeze manufactured by the oil company, at below minimum retail prices.

Stat. &sect; 50-301-310 (1949), which made the stipulated minimum retail price fixed by the chemical company in its contracts with retailers in Kansas binding upon all other persons selling the antifreeze whether or not they were parties to those contracts. The oil company filed an action in the trial court. Judgment was rendered in favor of the chemical company sustaining the Act. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the nonsigner clause of the Act was an unconstitutional attempt to delegate legislative power to private persons in violation of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. The statute, beyond permitting voluntary contracts or agreements between a trademark owner and a retailer to fix a minimum resale price binding upon the signing retailer, gave legislative sanction to the trade-mark owner to fix minimum resale prices binding upon nonsigners. All other assignments of error were moot.</SPAN></P>

Article 2, &sect; 16 required that a bill contain one subject and that the subject be &quot;clearly expressed&quot; in its title. The title of the act at issue stated that it provided for the assessment, levy, and collection of a tax upon the gross value of certain products and providing for the disposition of revenues received from such tax and penalties for the violation of the act. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 79-4202 (Supp. 1957) provided that an annual privilege tax was levied and imposed upon every person engaging or continuing within the state the business of producing or severing oil or gas from the soil or water for sale, transport, storage, profit, or commercial use. The title of the act did not &quot;clearly&quot; convey the subject of the act because it did not state what items were to be taxed. Thus, the entire act was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The water district then sought passage of an enactment to finance the project. The water district then presented the enactment to the auditor for issuance of the necessary bonds and interest coupons. The auditor refused to issue the bonds, and the water district filed a mandamus action to compel the issuance. The trial court granted the writ, and the auditor challenged the decision contending that the provisions under which the water district acted, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19-3501-3521 (Supp. 1955), and Kan. Comp. Laws ch. 192 (1957) were unconstitutional. The court disagreed holding first that the title of the enactments was sufficient to notify the reader of the enactments' contents, thus was not overbroad or vague. Second, the statutes were proper exercises of the water district, which was authorized to act by the State legislature. Third, the statutes were proper special laws that did not violate the constitutional prohibition against such enactments because the district covered was special and unique in nature. Therefore, the application for mandamus was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners had purchased property three years before county zoning was enacted. They used the property for auto sales, repair, and wrecking. They made a number of valuable improvements including a concrete block building and a frame building. The county chose Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19-2927 through 19-2936 (Supp. 1955) as authority for its zoning resolution. The district in which the landowners' property was located was designated residential and property owners were given two years to comply. The court rejected the landowners' argument that the county officials should have chosen a zoning plan that did not provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses. The court found that there was evidence sufficient to sustain the findings that the adoption of the resolution and its application to the landowners was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. As harsh as the effect might be on the landowners' business, the court explained that there was no unlawful discrimination. The court added that, after considering the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the action requiring the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses remained a proper exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

The turnpike authority argued that the various appeals should be consolidated as a matter of law. In its original opinion, the court held that any party interested in the condemnation proceedings was entitled to a separate trial. On rehearing, the court vacated the portion of its decision addressing the consolidation of the appeals. Under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 26-102 (Supp. 1955), when an appeal in a condemnation proceeding was taken to the district court, the action was to be docketed and tried the same as other actions. Once the appeal was filed in the district court, the question of the sufficiency of the award was presented and the trial of that issue was conclusive on all of the parties. The right of the owner of a leasehold interest to share in the award did not entitle the owner to a separate trial to determine compensation and damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and the Department contended that if the domiciliary administration theory sent assets out of Kansas for administration, there was no reason why the theory should not be equally valid when applied in reverse where a decedent was domiciled in Kansas. The court held that while Kansas had the power to determine whether or not it would retain assets within its boundary and administer upon them or give them up to the state of a non-resident decedent's domicile for the purpose of administration, if the court should seek to impose the mobilia doctrine in reverse it would immediately transcend its powers and seek to give its judgments extra-territorial effect by infringing upon the sovereign rights of other states. Therefore, the court held that the courts of Missouri had jurisdiction to administer upon the intangible property in question and that the courts of Kansas did not have jurisdiction to administer upon such intangible property, unless the state of Missouri ceded its jurisdiction over such property to the resident executrix.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board created a road benefit district under the provisions of &sect; 68-731. An abutting landowner filed a protest, alleging inter alia that &sect; 68-731 was unconstitutional and that &sect; 68-731 was not applicable because not all of the land on one side of the street, road, or avenue sought to be improved was platted. The trial court upheld the board's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute was general in form as well as in application and therefore, was not special legislation in violation of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. The population classification as to townships affected by &sect; 68-731 did not violate Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. The statute created a classification that was not arbitrary and capricious. It was based upon an apparently natural reason and was warranted by a real, not fictitious different in the condition or situation of the particular class of townships to which it applied. Because it was conceded that all of the land on one side of the portion of the street sought to be improved was platted and was laid off in blocks or lots, the landowner's claim on error on that point could not be upheld.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 36-104 (1955 Supp.) was unconstitutional because it violated Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. The trial court quashed the information charging appellee homeowner with violation of Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36-104.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner refused to obtain a license to operate her apartment house. The homeowner had a four-room apartment and lived in one of the rooms. An information alleging a violation of &sect; 36-104 was filed. The trial court found that the legislature's classification of a four-room apartment was arbitrary. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the regulation and licensing of hotels, apartment houses, rooming houses, and motels based upon the &quot;number of rooms&quot; had long been established as a reasonable exercise of the police powers as well as reasonable class legislation by the legislature. In its wisdom, the legislature had determined that apartment houses of four or more units affected the public health, safety, and welfare and should be licensed and regulated. The law applied generally to all apartment houses with four or more units. It operated uniformly on all owners who occupied one of their units. The fact that the owner occupied one of the units did not change the legislative reason for licensing and regulation. The court concluded that &sect; 36-104 was uniform in its application. The classification was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the filing of the company's 1955 tax assessment return of its gathering lines, the state refused to accept that return and told the company to return, in addition to these lines, the extraction plant for assessment purposes, and that if it did not do so and provide complete financial data and information, the state would assess both the gathering lines and the extraction plant from such information as it had available, add 50 percent for failure to file a proper return, and impose all statutory penalties. The company alleged that the state's actions constituted the taking of its property without due process of law and denied it the equal protection of the law in violation of the 14th Amendment. The court rejected the state's claim that the company's petition was defective because it failed to affirmatively allege the action taken by the commission was &quot;illegal.&quot; Allegations that the state's actions were unconstitutional clearly inferred that such actions were also illegal. Contrary to the state's belief, administrative remedies included in Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 79-1702 were not exclusive and thus did not prevent the company from suing in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment with directions to the district court to overrule the demurrer and to proceed to hear the case upon its merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general argued that the legislative acts that created a state emergency fund were unconstitutional and void because they violated the state constitution. The court held that the legislation was valid. The court found that the challenged appropriation acts were within the specific appropriations allowed by Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 24. The state legislature properly used its legislative power by creating the finance council and the emergency fund and making appropriations to it to be allocated pursuant to conditions and limitations that were prescribed by the legislature. The duties imposed on the finance council were administrative in nature. Although the standards prescribed by the legislation were general in terms, they were sufficient. Because of the varied facts that might affect the emergency fund and its policies, the legislature wisely did not undertake to enumerate all possibilities.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers also appealed the overruling of their motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to strike on the grounds of redundancy and irrelevancy was sustained as to some of the taxpayers' pleadings, and the taxpayers' demurrer as to the district's evidence on the issue of res judicata was overruled. The court affirmed the district court's rulings, concluding that the record supported those decisions. The legislation that authorized the issuance of the bonds was not special legislation in contravention of Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 because it applied equally to every taxpayer who lived in the boundaries of either or both of the districts. Further, the fact that the taxpayers who lived in the overlapping area of the districts would have paid twice as much in taxes than those who only lived in the boundary of one district did not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause because precedent showed that the fact that a taxpayer did not directly benefit from a tax or benefited less from a tax than others who paid the same amount of tax or less tax did not render such a tax unconstitutional. Further, the commonality of the parties and the issues in the current action and a prior action justified the district's evidence regarding res judicata.</SPAN></P>

On a Sunday, an undercover agent for the alcoholic beverage control agency asked if he could buy a pint of liquor.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-315 and &sect; 41-712. Defendant was tried and convicted. He appealed to the district court, but he was again convicted, and his various motions were overruled. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statutes were ambiguous and, therefore, unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant contended that the acts prohibited were not criminal in nature because there was no prescribed punishment. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 41-902 provided that anyone violating the liquor control law for which no penalty was specifically provided was subject to a fine or imprisonment as set forth in that provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's petition alleged, among other things, that the resolution was unconstitutional and void because it violated Kan.

Defendants demurrer on the ground that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in favor of plaintiff. In ousting the committee and its members, the court held that the question it was concerned with was whether House Joint Resolution No. 1 was beyond the power conferred by art. II, &sect; 25. The resolution amending art. II, &sect; 25 borrowed from 1953 Kan. Sess. Laws 375 certain phrases. The court held that the history of art. II, &sect; 25 and the history of 1953 Kan. Sess. Laws 375 had to be considered together and that in adopting the resolution, no voter would have had the idea that he was voting for a session that would have provided unlimited powers. The conclusion was inescapable that the legislature in preparing the amendment to the resolution to submit to the people intended it to be restricted to budget matters.</SPAN></P>

The Sedgwick District Court, Division No. 4 (Kansas) sustained the Board's demurrer that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. After the optometrist appealed, the district court re-instated a restraining order against the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The optometrist argued that provisions of the Optometry Act, Kan. Rev. Stat. ch. 65, art. 15 (1949), creating the Board and Kan. Rev. Stat. ch. 74, art. 15 (1949), providing for the examination and registration of optometrists, were unconstitutional. The court pointed out that if the statutes were unconstitutional, there would be no Board and anything it did would be a nullity, and the court's duty was to construe the Act to uphold it if possible. The court explained that provisions of the Act were separated in the codification but it was interpreted as a whole. The court concluded that the optometrist had no standing to attack the Act it in its entirety or with regard to provisions not involved in the charges. The court emphasized that the optometrist was charged, not in a criminal action, but in a proceeding to revoke his certificate of registration under portions of the Act not under attack. The court ruled that he was entitled to no injunctive relief. The court found the method of selecting Board members from lists provided by the Kansas optometric association was constitutional. The court saw nothing that warranted interfering with the Board's lawful performance of its duties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company operated vending machines that offered merchandise for sale at five and 10 cents per transaction. The director of revenue made an assessment of tax against the company for its gross receipts. The company appealed to the commission which, after a hearing, fixed an assessment. The company appealed to the district court as provided by Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 74-2426 (1949). The trial court found that the assessment was proper and that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 79-3603(f) (1953 Supp.) was constitutionally valid. The company appealed and claimed that the tax was improper because according to rules of the Commission, the tax was to be borne by the purchaser, and yet the retailer was prohibited from collecting a tax on sales on items costing 14 cents or less. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 79-3603(f) was a general law and not a special law, and it operation did not deny the company due process of law or equal protection of the law. The fact that the company's sales were so small that it was not possible or practicable for it to collect tax from its purchaser did not render the classification in &sect; 79-3603(f), arbitrary, illusory, capricious or fictitious.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the Law did not unconstitutionally authorize land acquisitions through the exercise of eminent domain because the use and purpose for which property could be acquired was public not private. Moreover, the court held that even though the Law allowed a city to exercise its urban renewal powers through an agency, board, or commissioner, the Law was not an unlawful delegation of legislative powers under Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to build an office building, an insurance company had to apply for a special zoning permit from the township zoning board.

The court upheld the trial court's denial of the residents' request for a jury trial. Under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 60-2903 (1949), the residents were not entitled to a jury trial because their action was not for recovery of money or of specific real or personal property. The township zoning board did not lose jurisdiction over the land due to the creation of a new urban township after the enactment of Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 80-2301-80-2308 (Supp. 1953) because those statutes did not provide the urban township with the power to zone property.

However, the landowner argued that the title of &sect; 68-114 as originally enacted limited the board's right to condemn land under the provisions thereof solely for widening, altering, or vacating roads for the purpose of eliminating sharp turns or other dangerous places and that the board thus had no power or authority to widen the highway for the proper construction thereof. The court held that the landowner's contention could not be upheld because the legislature of 1923 adopted &sect; 68-114 under a new title that had been held sufficient as not containing more than one subject, any defects in the original title of the statute were cured by its adoption under the 1923 revision, and the title of the statute as adopted by the legislature of 1923 was sufficiently inclusive to authorize the board to widen a road or highway for the purpose of its proper construction.</SPAN></P>

The Commission was authorized to establish preserves and to establish, maintain, and improve recreational grounds for the purpose of affording recreational facilities to the citizens of the State. The right to hunt was inherent in all people and was a public purpose. The hunting would amount to nothing more than an incidental use of the entire project, rather than the primary use.</SPAN></P>

The general rule was that proceedings to exercise the right of eminent domain were in rem and not in personam.

The trial court denied the corporations recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations were all foreign to the forum state and had paid property taxes on the cars in their state. The cars were used by employees of the corporations and driven home by the employees who lived in defendant county. The cars were in defendant county at night, on weekends, and over holidays. The question was whether the cars owned by a nonresident corporation acquired such permanent situs in defendant county as to entitle the taxing units therein to assess them and levy a tax thereon. The cars were not in the forum state temporarily because they were in the state over 50 percent of the time. They had at their disposal and for their protection and benefit the fire and police organizations, streets, sidewalks, bridges, shopping facilities, and recreational places. The cars were not in the state as transients because they were returned every night. The court held that the tangible property involved was permanently in defendant county and was subject to taxation by the taxing units thereof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that the betting operations in question constituted a lottery, in violation of the state constitution.

The trial court adopted defendant's theory and denied an injunction for the two week period, but enjoined the operations for the remainder of the calendar year. From that portion of the ruling denying an injunction, the State appealed. On appeal, the court found the operations in question did constitute a lottery and the sale of lottery tickets. Thus, the court held that the trial court erred in holding that the gambling operations did not constitute a lottery within the meaning of &sect; 21-1510 and did not violate the Kansas Constitution, Kan.

The Johnson District Court (Kansas) upheld the Nevada decree of divorce and awarded the wife certain property and alimony pursuant to Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 60-1518 (1949). The husband sought review of the order overruling his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court gave full faith and credit to the Nevada divorce decree as to its dissolution of the marriage but made findings of fact and entered judgment giving the respective parties their individual properties and awarding the wife the home property, furnishings, and alimony. The husband contended that the trial court had no authority to award alimony because the Nevada divorce decree was obtained due to the fault of the wife and with constructive service. The court held that the trial court properly granted full faith and credit to the Nevada decree insofar as it terminated the marriage and that it properly limited the trial of the action to the unadjudicated alimony and property rights issues. Pursuant to Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 60-1518 (1949), the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the wife's property rights and alimony because she had not been personally served with summons in Nevada or appeared there and actually litigated her property rights or alimony. Accordingly, these questions could be litigated in Kansas in an appropriate proceeding commenced within two years. The husband failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in its division of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its petition, the State alleged that the corporation solicited the State Board of Administration for permission to construct a building on land owned by the State in fee. The Board purported to agree to the construction and the purported agreement was reduced to writing. The State asserted that the agreement was void because the Board had no statutory or constitutional authority to enter into the agreement. The State argued that the legislature was without authority to appropriate funds to pay the corporation for the purchase of the building. On appeal, the court rejected the State's argument that the title to the building was at all times in the state and that, therefore, the corporation had nothing to sell. The corporation was granted lawful permission to erect a building for the treatment of tubercular patients. The right of possession remained in the corporation. The contract contained nothing to indicate that the building was to become property of the state simply because it was built on state land. Even if the State lacked authority to enter into the contract, the legislature's appropriation was valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statement did not comply with the claims statute, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-105 (1949), because it was silent as to the place of the injuries. On appeal, the landowners contended that the trial court erred in dismissing the action because the statement they filed with the clerk met the requirements of &sect; 12-105 or because the action was maintainable regardless of the terms of the claim filed. On review, the court held that the language of the claims statute was mandatory and substantial compliance with it was required before an action against the City could be maintained. The statement filed with the City's clerk disclosed neither the time nor the place of the injuries and the statement of the circumstances was vague. The landowners were not seeking recovery for the mere erection of the dike on other's land but for damages to two tracts of their land, but they failed to state whether the damages were to one or the other or both of the tracts.</SPAN></P>

The company and the distributor filed its action for injunctive relief and the trial court found, among other things, that the Board had construed the terms &quot;obscene, indecent, and immoral&quot; too broadly and vaguely and that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 51-103 to 51-109 (1949), pertaining to the censorship process, therefore violated U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. The court, in reversing the trial court's judgment, disagreed. The court first found that the Board did not abuse its administrative discretion in arriving at its conclusion. Next, the court, noting that the terms had accepted, definite, and clear meanings, found that the Board's use of the words &quot;obscene, indecent, immoral, or such as tend to debase or corrupt morals&quot; was not so vague or indefinite as to offend due process. Accordingly, the court concluded that the trial court was without authority to act as a supervisor of the Board or to substitute its judgment for that of the Board in light of the legislature's grant of such authority to the Board alone.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that where a person accused of a crime had been sentenced following a guilty plea, the judgment carried with it a presumption of regularity. Petitioner had the burden of establishing facts showing that his constitutional rights had been invaded. The record showed that the trial court fully advised petitioner as to his right to counsel and to a trial by jury and that petitioner signed a statement that he did not want counsel to represent him. Petitioner's statement that he was without counsel, that advantage was taken of him, and that he was forced to enter a plea of guilty, were contrary to the record.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 68-2001 et seq. (1953). Specifically, the State alleged the powers and duties conveyed to the authority were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act at issue created the authority and fixed its powers and duties. The State contended that the Act violated Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 because it constituted an unlawful delegation of power in that it fixed no standard for the selection of locations of turnpike projects and the authority was given uncontrolled discretion in respect to the employment of experts and employees, and the fixing of their compensation. The State further asserted that the Act unlawfully authorized the issuance of bonds without limitation and authorized the state highway commission to advance funds for preliminary studies in connection with the construction of a turnpike project without any provision for determining the circumstances under which the money would be advanced. The court disagreed with the position taken by the State. It had previously approved the construction of state road systems by other statutes and had recognized that the state legislature could make further classifications to build roads. Thus, the legislature was empowered to appoint the authority to construct turnpike projects. The court held that the State's specific contentions were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to build the irrigation system, the district had entered into a contract with the United States Government. To pay for the construction, the district filed an action in the district court under Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-721 (1949) to assess all the landowners in the district based on the type of land, quantity of land, and the benefit of the irrigation system to the land. The district was ordered to disclose the existing plans on which it had based its proposed schedule of assessments. After the district disclosed that it had no such plans, the landowners filed their motion to dismiss, contending that approval of the schedule of assessments was a condition precedent to contract approval. The trial court found that the contract should be approved because the role of the court was to determine whether a tract or tracts were disproportionately assessed. On appeal, the court held that the contract should be approved, noting that the assessments would be subject to review and landowner appeal at any time after formation of the district and construction of the system, and to give meaning to the legislation, approval of the overall plan prior to individual assessment was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment approving the contract, and reversed that portion of the judgment withdrawing the schedule of assessments to the landowners.</SPAN></P>

It also alleged the city's acquisitions were not for a public use and the leases were invalid. The court determined that the statutory provisions did not constitute an illegal delegation of legislative power to cities and the statutes did not contravene Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1, regarding the separation of powers. Moreover, the acquisition of private property for off-street parking facilities constituted a public use. However, the contract for a lease the city entered into for the operation, management and control of off-street parking facilities was invalid. The city improperly bound its successors in office to lease parking facilities not yet in contemplation and it bound them to rebuild or repair such facilities if they were destroyed, regardless of whether rebuilding them would be a public use. Also, the lease delegated the city's power to establish the rates and fees to be charged to a private corporation. These lease provisions were not authorized by the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act provided for a clearing up of substandard and insanitary areas within cities of the first class, comprised of a population greater than 125,000, and with a townsite in existence for over 90 years. The State's action requested injunctive relief against defendants' further preparation and adoption of redevelopment plans. The State alleged that defendants should have been restrained because they were acting in an unconstitutional and illegal manner when they lacked any power to perform under the Act. The State prevailed because the Act violated Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. The court held that the Act was a special act when a general act could have been made applicable. The court concluded that the Act's purported classification based on the population of a city with a townsite that had been incorporated for over 90 years was unnatural. The court found that the classification did not involve distinctions having a reasonable and substantial relation to the subject matter. The court concluded that those distinctions were arbitrary, fictitious, and capricious.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that an order of the board of county commissioners purporting to incorporate a village as a city was null and void because the board abused its discretion by purporting to incorporate a large territory, the order did not set forth the metes and bounds, that the board ignored the mandate that it must find the number of inhabitants was within the maximum limits required, and that the order was fatally defective. In affirming, the court held that Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 923 (1889) made no requirement that the territory in the proposed city be limited to platted lands, that statutes specifying the acreage to be annexed to an incorporated city were not part nor parcel of statutes authorizing incorporation, and that failure to include in the order the statement that the population did not exceed 2000 was an irregularity that could not be said to invalidate the order. The State's claim that the extension of territory ordinances were unconstitutional and void was without merit because Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1018 (1889) allowed that additions that were lots and blocks of less than five acres each became part of the city when an ordinance was duly passed and published.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The school board answered by a general denial. The trial court found that all questions as to actions of the school board complained of in the petition were moot as the school district had reconciled the alleged problems. Thus, the trial court denied relief as well as the taxpayers' motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, although it was aware that the motion to dismiss was predicated on the claim the controversy was moot and not on any lack of capacity of the taxpayers to maintain the action, there was not sufficient public interest to warrant a hearing for a declaratory judgment. The taxpayers were without capacity to maintain the action for alleged abuse of power.

Const. art. II, &sect; 17. In particular that the act only affected cities of the first and second class having a population of less than 80,000 inhabitants was not arbitrary, illusory, and capricious.

II, &sect; 16. The act did not violate Kan. Const. Bill of Rights &sect;&sect; 1, 2, or 18, or the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because having created an integrated sewage and water system the city could not be said to be taking the revenues from one system to fund the other.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a dairy corporation that sold a frozen ice cream dessert, sought to enjoin defendant public officials from enforcing Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 65-707 (1949) and the Ice Milk Statute, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 65-708 (1935), now Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 65-720, 65-721 (1949). Plaintiff appealed a judgment of the trial court (Kansas) finding the product prohibited. The trial court determined that &sect;&sect; 65-720, 65-721 did not violate Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The product was made of vegetable oil, powdered skim milk, sugar, stabilizer, powered egg yolk, and water. Defendants argued that the product was prohibited by the Ice Milk Statute because it was made in the semblance of ice cream in that it looked and tasted like ice cream but had vegetable oil and contained less than 10 percent milk fat. In affirming, the court held that the dairy's argument that the product was not prohibited by the Ice Milk Statute was without merit because despite the dairy's claim that its product was not &quot;ice milk,&quot; the conclusion was warranted that the statutes provided a product made in the semblance of ice milk and containing less than 10 percent butter fat could not be sold if it contained vegetable oil. Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 65-720, 65-721 did violate Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 because if a product was readily susceptible of being sold fraudulently, then the legislature had power to prohibit its sale. Because the product had the consistency, taste, and color of whole milk products, the court did not consider the validity of Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 65-720 and Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 65-721 as applied to compounds that were distinguishable from whole milk compounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the trial court (Kansas), which, upon defendant's conviction of larceny of an automobile, in violation of Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-533 (1949), sentenced defendant under the habitual criminal statute, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-107a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that his sentence was improperly imposed under the habitual criminal statute, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-107a. Defendant contented this was true as he had no notice previous convictions would be considered in determining the penalty to be imposed as the information contained no reference to his previous convictions and that if they were to be considered in determining his penalty for the instant offense they should have been pleaded in the information. The court held that a determination of the length of sentence to be pronounced pursuant to &sect; 21-107a was no concern of the jury but rested solely in the province of the trial court. The statute was not unconstitutional by reason of the fact no issue was joined in the trial of the action relative to the commission of a previous offense, or offenses. Moreover, the absence of charges in the information concerning the commission of prior felonies was to his advantage and for his benefit. Further, &sect; 21-107a did not expressly require notice after conviction and before sentence that he was to be confronted at the time of sentencing with evidence of former convictions that would increase the length of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a car full of people to a dance when he struck a bridge and killed a passenger. At trial, none of the surviving passengers who testified stated that they saw defendant drink any alcohol. A police officer and another witness testified that defendant smelled like alcohol after the accident. Two open bottles of whiskey were found in defendant's vehicle. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the negligent homicide statute, Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-529, was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to inform him the nature of the criminal acts for which he could be held liable. The court found that the language of the statute, which prohibited the negligent disregard the safety of others, was neither vague nor indefinite. The court found that it was not necessary for the statute to detail the numerous circumstances, acts, and omissions from which death could result when committed in the disregard of the safety of others. The instructions were proper, and defendant had a fair trial. The court found that there was sufficient evidence on both counts to sustain the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed from a judgment of the Stafford District Court (Kansas), which sustained defendant city's demurrer to the property owner's petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city made plans to open a dedicated street for drainage purposes. The property owner owned property abutting the street and filed action to prevent the city from grading and ditching the street because the property owner had been using the property for agricultural purposes for many years. He claimed that the city failed to comply with Kan. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-427 (1951 Supp.) which required that notice be given and damages for the taking of property. The trial court granted the city's demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that under &sect; 15-427, the city had power to open, widen, extend or otherwise improve any street or to create, open and improve any new street whenever deemed necessary or expedient. Where a city street was already dedicated when the founders of the city recorded the plat of the property, the street was vested in the city, and its right to open the street could not be lost through nonuse, laches, estoppel, adverse possession, or statutes of limitation. There was no requirement to pay damages to abutting property owners for the opening of such streets because there was no taking of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the school boards of a rural high-school district and a common-school district, challenged a judgment of the Rooks District Court (Kansas) entered in favor of appellee, the State of Kansas, in the State's action to enjoin the school boards from issuing general obligation bonds for the purpose of constructing a school building for the joint use of both districts, as authorized by an election held by each district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board members of the two school districts met and selected a new site for the construction of a joint school building. Notice of a bond election for each district was published for the purpose of issuing bonds for the erection of the joint school building. Both elections were held and the bonds carried. The State filed an action to enjoin the issuance of the bonds. The trial court granted the State's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the school boards had no authority to determine the question of uniting for the purpose of constructing a joint building and selecting a site for the building, but should have held an election. It also overruled the State's motion challenging the constitutionality of R.I. Gen. Laws &sect; 72-507 (Supp. 1951), which authorized the union of the districts to construct such a building. The court held that under &sect; 72-507, which was constitutional, the districts could unite in the construction of a building for their joint use and were not required to hold an election to obtain authority to do so. A prior statute, which required an election, had been repealed by &sect; 72-507 and its language omitting the necessity of such an election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment entered in favor of the State in its action for an injunction, and affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the State's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
